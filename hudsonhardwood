Hardwood Blog
While the thought of buying hardwood floors may seem daunting, they are a beautiful addition to any home and an investment in that home‚Äôs future. With a little knowledge, you‚Äôll be ready to move forward with getting the floors of your dreams! For tips and tricks about how to clean and care for your hardwood floors, to articles about the latest trends and styles in hardwood floors ‚Äì you‚Äôll find it all on the Hudson Hardwood blog.
Considering Buying Hardwood Floors?
With the many options available today it‚Äôs smart to do some homework first before you purchase hardwood floors. There are many varieties and styles available, the basics being solid or engineered planks. Solid planks come from a single piece of wood while engineered are comprised of several planks laminated or glued together.
Long strip, Exotic, Hand Scraped, and Distressed are terms used to describe the plank origin and the finish on the planks. Planks can come finished or unfinished. Unfinished planks allow them to be finished once they are installed, giving a more customized look.
Depending on the type of floor they are going over, hardwood floors can be installed in several ways. The most common is by nails or staples. Other options include glue, adhesive-less, and floating.

Care and Cleaning of Hardwood Floors
Some people are hesitant to purchase hardwood floors because they‚Äôre afraid of the time and effort it will take to maintain them. Rest assured, hardwood floors are extremely durable. While scratches and stains can happen, there are ways to take care of them to keep your floors looking great for years.
Hudson Hardwood recommends no harsh chemicals or cleaners. Over time these can build up and make your floors look bad. Occasionally, vinegar can help clean hardwood floors, but only in moderation.
Scratches can also occur from moving furniture or other of life‚Äôs unforeseen happenings. Not to worry though, with a few short steps you can repair a scratch on your own. Visit our blog to see detailed instructions on ‚ÄúHardwood Floor Scratch Repair.‚Äù
It is, of course, a good idea to have your hardwood floors professionally cleaned and re-coated when they do eventually start to show signs of wear and tear. Hudson Hardware can help with this. Learn more on our Cleaning and Recoating page.

Hardwood Floors Today
Many of the areas we service date back to the 1800 and 1900s when hardwood floors were common in larger estates. Flooring has changed a lot since then, but hardwood floors remain top-of-the-line in home decor. Today‚Äôs technology and products gives us more hardwood flooring options than ever before to achieve the looks our customers want.
Traditional hardwood floors are made up of one plank size and then a consistent stain throughout. Today, consumers can choose from gray or bleached hardwood floors. Styles and patterns are even seeing a comeback including herringbone. Some customers are modernizing the look of their floors by laying planks at an angle rather than horizontally.
A few adventurous homeowners are even experimenting with the latest trend of mixing plank sizes. This unexpected style can add interest and depth to any room.",hudsonhardwood

Fun Facts About Devon, PA
Devon, PA is a town on Philadelphia‚Äôs Main Line located in Easttown Township, Chester County. Devon grew along with the railroad, where people began to settle in the 1800s.

Today, the Horse Show is the oldest and largest event of its kind in the United States and is one of the most prestigious equestrian events. It is held each year in late May and lasts for ten days.
In 1919 The Devon County Fair was added to the festivities of the Devon Horse Show. The County Fair includes rides, food, vendors, and more. With the help of hundreds of local volunteers, proceeds from these events benefit Bryn Mawr Hospital. Competitors come from around the world to enjoy Devon‚Äôs local traditions.
Funds raised from these events have resulted in over $16 million in donations to Bryn Mawr Hospital, allowing it to remain a best-in-class hospital. Most recently, the Devon Horse Show and County Fair volunteers pledged $2 million towards building a brand-new pavilion with cutting edge operating rooms, intensive care units, and a labor and delivery unit.

Gladwyne History
Gladwyne, PA, was known as Merion Square until 1891. It is part of a cluster of towns to the west of Philadelphia known as the Main Line. Early on the town preserved open space and to this day this has allowed it to retain its rural charm. Banker James Crosby Brown built a 185-acre estate in Gladwyne. The estate was later divided into lots of three to 17 acres. This, along with the preserved open space, set precedents in Gladwyne that have limited the sub-division and over-development that some other towns in the area have experienced.
When I-76 (the Schuylkill Expressway) was built in the 1960s it made Gladwyne even more desirable since it was close to the highway, and also close to King of Prussia, which was quickly becoming a business hub.

A few notable locations include the historic Guard House Inn and the Merion Cricket Club.

History of Manayunk
Manayunk is a neighborhood along the banks of the Schuylkill River in the northwest part of Philadelphia that is known for its hilly streets and bike races. Surrounding areas include Roxborough and Wissahickon. The U.S. almost built the first canal in Manayunk, but they canceled the project due to budget problems.
The name Manayunk comes from the language of the Lenape Indians who originally inhabited the area. Their word for river, Manaiung, meaning ‚Äúplace to drink,‚Äù was later transformed to Manayunk.
With an influx of Polish, Irish, and German immigrants, Manayunk became home to many Catholic churches that today give much of its character. Just a few of these churches include St. John the Baptist, St. Lucy‚Äôs, St. Mary‚Äôs, and St. Josaphat‚Äôs. In 1924 the Josie D Heard AME church was established to serve its growing African American population.
Cultural in Manayunk
Residents of Manayunk enjoy thriving retail and cultural areas along Main Street, where there are shops, art galleries, restaurants, and more. Since 1989 Manayunk has hosted the Manayunk Arts Festival, a large outdoor festival held each June. Year-round artists can convene at the Manayunk-Roxborough Art Center.
Due to its hills, Manayunk became the site of many bike races. It was once part of the Philadelphia International Championship, one of the longest races in the U.S., with nearly 200 kilometers in one day. Many famous cyclists competed in the Philadelphia International Championship, including Lance Armstrong, who won the race in 1993.
Over the years, the races have changed names as sponsors changed. Eventually, the race was called the Manayunk Bike Race and entailed a 12.3 mile course, including the ‚ÄúManayunk Wall,‚Äù a steep and challenging incline at Levering Street and Lyceum Avenue.
Education in Manayunk
The School District of Philadelphia serves Manayunk. Public schools include Cook-Wissahickon School (K-8), Dobson Elementary School (K-8), and Roxborough High School. Students in K-8 may also attend the Green Woods Charter School.

Narberth, Pennsylvania is located in Montgomery County and is considered part of the Main Line, a group of towns outside of Philadelphia where wealthy Philadelphians built large sprawling estates. Narberth was incorporated in 1895. Narberth was different from other boroughs in that it claimed its independence from Lower Merion Township. Today, its population is just over 4,300 with a median household income of over $100,000 and an average home value of nearly $500,000.
The Narberth Train Station, conveniently located in downtown Narberth, is on the SEPTA Paoli/Thorndale Line. The railroad travels through the towns to the west of Philadelphia and was the reason the Main Line became the area it is today.
Narberth is close to the western edge of Philadelphia, and residents enjoy easy access to the amenities of Philadelphia. The town is in close proximity to many colleges and universities, including Saint Joseph‚Äôs University, Haverford College, Bryn Mawr College, Villanova University, Cabrini College, Eastern University, Rosemont College, and many more.
Downtown Narberth boasts a quaint shopping area with some businesses that have been around for a long time, including American Family Market, The Cheese Company, and Real Pizza. New businesses have joined them, and the Narberth Business Association actively promotes the area as a shopping destination for locals and tourists alike. Popular special events coordinated by the Association include the Spring Sidewalk Sale and the Narberth Dickens Festival.
Narberth‚Äôs official tree is the cherry tree, and there are plenty of them planted throughout the town. It became a destination for people from the city to visit Narberth in April and May to see the cherry trees and crabapple trees in bloom.
Narberth is part of the Lower Merion school district and the median age of its residents is just over 40 years old. Narberth is one of the few Main Line towns whose shopping and downtown district is located on the same street as the railroad station.
Notable public figures that hail from Narberth include Philadelphia Eagles founder Bert Bell, Metropolitan Opera star Margaret Harshaw, and WWII fighter ace Pug Southerland.
As many of the homes in Narberth date back to the 1800s and early 1900s, Hudson Hardwood‚Äôs team of expert craftsmen is often called upon to give old floors new life while preserving the original character of the home. With services like refinishing, installing, cleaning, recoating, and restoring, our team can tackle any challenge. We are reliable, work on your schedule, and complete our project with minimal interruption to your home or business.

New Hope has long served as the half-way stopping point for travelers going between Philadelphia and New York City.
Originally known as Coryell‚Äôs Ferry after the family who owned the ferry across the Delaware, New Hope was re-named in 1790. Fires had destroyed mills in the town, and their rebuilding gave new hope to the area.
During the revolutionary war, George Washington crossed the Delaware River in New Hope and destroyed the ferry so British troops would be unable to follow him. The British proceeded to shell the town.

History of Newtown Square
Newtown Square, PA, is located about 25 miles west of Philadelphia. The town has a long history and was originally a meeting place for Quakers living in the area. In 1711 the Newtown Square Friends Meetinghouse was built, solidifying Newtown Square as a meeting place.
In the 19th century, several mills were built in the area, including a woolen factory, a paper mill, and a sawmill. These businesses brought jobs to the site and other companies built up around them to serve the workers.
When the railroads were being built, none went to Newtown Square, so the population dropped while other towns in the area flourished. By the 20th century, though, Newtown Square had another boom when automobiles became more popular. Farms and other lands were divided, and the area became more suburban.
Historic Sites in Newtown Square
Given its history, it‚Äôs not surprising that several locations in Newtown Square are on the National Register of Historic Places. This includes the Square Tavern, Old St. David‚Äôs Church, and the Hood Octagonal School. These and other buildings from the 1700 and 1800s give the area a historic charm.

Newtown Square is conveniently located near major highways and public transportation, making getting around or commuting to work an easy task.

Hardwood gives a lot of character and style to your home, but it requires maintenance to keep it looking its best. Over time, your floors may start to look a little worn down, dull, or scratched. If you notice this, it might be time to refinish them.
Here are 3 signs that it‚Äôs time for a fresh coat of finish:
1. Your Floors Lost Their Luster
Over time, your hardwood floors will lose their shine and become dull. If you‚Äôve tried cleaning them, but they still look lackluster, it might be time to refinish them. Refinishing your floors is a big project, but it can make a huge difference in how your home looks and feels. Refinished floors regain their luster and help increase your home‚Äôs value.
2. You Notice Scratches And Dents
Over time, your hardwood floors will show signs of wear and tear. You might notice scratches from pet claws or high heels. Or, you might see dents from dropped items or furniture being moved around. These blemishes are expected, but they can make your floors look old and worn. Refinishing your floors will get rid of all the scratches and dents and start fresh with a new finish.
3. Your Floors Are Worn In High-Traffic Areas
High-traffic areas like hallways, living rooms, and kitchens can take a toll on your floors. You might notice that the finish is starting to wear away in these areas, or you might see damage from all the foot traffic. If your hardwood floors show signs of wear in high-traffic areas, it‚Äôs probably time to refinish them. Refinishing your floors will extend their lifespan.

5 Reasons Not To DIY Refinishing Your Floor
Hardwood floor refinishing might look easy, but it‚Äôs best to leave it to professionals. Here are 5 ways DIYing a refinishing project can hurt you.
1. It‚Äôs A Time-Consuming Project
Refinishing hardwood floors is a time-consuming job that requires patience and skill. It usually takes two or three days for an experienced professional to complete the job correctly. If you decide to do it yourself, it could take much longer than expected as you figure out how to get the job done effectively.
2. Refinishing Is Messy Work
Refinishing your hardwood floors creates dust and debris that needs to be removed from the area before you start the project and after completing it. Do-it-yourselfers often overlook this task, but cleaning up can lead to health hazards such as allergies or asthma symptoms.
3. You Need Special Tools
To refinish your hardwood floors, you‚Äôll need special tools and equipment that aren‚Äôt easily available at most hardware stores or online retailers. Professional contractors have access to these tools, which they use daily on their projects. They know how best to utilize them to get the job done right.

You risk damaging your hardwood floor beyond repair if you don‚Äôt refinish them correctly. You can also make them look worse than before you started the project. It‚Äôs best to hire experienced contractors that know how much to sand or how thick or thin a finish coat should be.

If you make a mistake during the refinishing process, correcting them will be costly as well as time-consuming. Most repairs must be handled by professionals specializing in this type of work. DIYing your project also means you can lose your warranty. Contractors are hardwood floor refinishing and installation experts, so they can fix any issue if you hire them from the beginning.

They also raise your home value. Still, some things can damage your hardwood floors and alter their appearance. Discover here 5 things that can damage your hardwood floors and what you can do to prevent this.
1. Water
Water is one of the biggest enemies of hardwood floors. When water seeps into the cracks and crevices of your floor, it can cause the wood to swell and warp. In extreme cases, it can even lead to rotting. To avoid water damage, quickly wipe up any spills and never allow standing water on your floors.
2. Direct Sunlight
Sunlight can also damage hardwood floors. Ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun can fade the color of your floor over time. Keep the blinds or curtains closed when possible to protect your floors from sun damage and use rugs in high-traffic areas. Professional hardwood services can help with this.
3. Dirt And Debris
Salt, sand, and dirt can also wear down hardwood floors. These particles can act like sandpaper, scratching and dulling the finish of your floors. To avoid this damage, sweep or vacuum regularly and place mats or rugs at all entrances to your home. If your floors end up scratched, then hardwood floor refinishing can fix this.
4. Failing To Clean Them Regularly
If you don‚Äôt clean your hardwood floors, the dirt and debris will build up over time and cause permanent damage. To avoid this, sweep or vacuum weekly and mop with a gentle cleanser monthly. Hardwood floor restoration can help with this.
5. Hiring Inexperienced Professionals
When cleaning, repairing, or refinishing hardwood floors, hiring experienced professionals is important. Inexperienced professionals can cause permanent damage to your floors by using the wrong products or techniques. Do your research before hiring anyone to work on your hardwood floors.

Let‚Äôs go through some of the amazing qualities of hardwood.
Durability
Hardwood flooring provides homeowners with an easily customized surface that can be a great addition to their homes. Woods used for hardwood flooring provide homeowners with durability because they are sturdy and will not warp or expand over time like other flooring types, such as carpeting.
Adds Beauty And Value
Wood is a beautiful floor covering that offers homeowners a vast selection of styles and colors to choose from. Installing wood floors on the main living levels of a home can be an additional selling point if you are planning on selling your home in the future and adding beauty to your daily life.

Adds Comfort & Warmth to a Home
There are many reasons why homeowners choose wood as their preferred floor covering option for interior design. Aside from the fact that wood is a beautiful option for floors, it also provides homeowners with added warmth and comfort because of its natural feel underfoot.
Wood absorbs noise well, so this type of flooring can be great if you have children or pets who may be running around inside your home during the day or night. Wood has natural insulation properties, which means that it will help keep the air inside your home at a more comfortable temperature during those hot and cold months throughout the year.
Provides an Upscale Look
Another great reason to consider hardwood flooring as your flooring of choice is that it offers people a way to create upscale-looking rooms in their homes without spending an arm and a leg on expensive materials or renovations.

Not only are they timeless and full of character, but they are also surprisingly durable. Still, taking certain steps to ensure their longevity is crucial. Sanding hardwood floors is an integral part of this process as it helps restore the wood‚Äôs original luster while strengthening the floor beneath.
Let us guide you through all the basics so you can achieve your desired results.
What Is Sanding?
Sanding is used to smooth out rough surfaces, remove imperfections, and prepare a surface for staining or finishing. This can range from light sanding to remove minor scratches or blemishes to heavy-duty sanding that strips away existing coatings. No matter what kind of project you are working on, getting the surface right is essential for achieving a beautiful result.
Types of Sandpaper
Before you start sanding, you must select the right type of sandpaper for the job at hand. Generally speaking, three main types of sandpaper are available: aluminum oxide, ceramic aluminum oxide, and zirconia alumina. Each type has unique characteristics and benefits:
- Aluminum oxide is great for general-purpose use.
- Ceramic aluminum oxide is perfect for hardwoods with an open-grain structure.
- Zirconia alumina works well with closed-grain woods such as walnut or cherry.
How To Sand Wood Properly
Once you have selected the right type of sandpaper for your project, it‚Äôs time to get down to business! The key here is patience; take your time when doing any woodworking project. Don‚Äôt be afraid to go over areas multiple times if necessary.
Start with a coarse grit paper (e.g., 120-grit) and progress through finer grits (e.g., 150-grit and 180-grit) until you are left with an even finish across the entire surface area. Use overlapping strokes when moving across the wood; this will ensure that no sections are accidentally missed or skipped over during the process.
Ensure You Sand Your Hardwoods Correct
Proper sanding can transform any furniture or floor into something special. It takes skill and experience to get it just right, however ‚Äî which is why so many people turn to Hudson Hardwood when they need help with their projects! Our team specializes in dustless sanding services for both residential and commercial spaces ‚Äî ensuring customer satisfaction every step of the way! We also offer:

67,https://hudsonhardwood.com/blog/bamboo-hardwood-flooring/,"Bamboo floors are gaining traction as more homeowners find appeal in them. Changes in style and a growing interest in ecological products have pushed this trend. Let‚Äôs go through why bamboo is great for flooring. Discover if getting bamboo hardwood flooring services is best for you.
Sustainability
Sustainability is one of the factors drawing more people to bamboo flooring. Bamboo is a type of grass that can reach maturity in five years. After harvest, it regenerates itself through the root system. The production cycle for this type of wood begins by using either traditional methods or modern technology, depending on the harvesting area.
Bamboo trees are usually cut down after growing about 90 percent of their full height. This allows them to regenerate and provide another crop in as little as four years after being harvested.
Availability
Bamboo has gained popularity in hardwood flooring due to how easily available bamboo is, especially imported varieties from Eastern Asia countries like China and Japan. As demand grew, these became easily available because they were readily accessible within geographical proximity to other major manufacturing centers worldwide.
This availability is also made possible by modern technology, which has created new ways to process bamboo into boards that are stable enough for flooring. Bamboo hardwood floors are now available in different styles, thicknesses, and finishes comparable to traditional wood types.
Advantages
Bamboo also has excellent sound absorption levels comparable to traditional wood ones, such as maple and oak. This important property provides the flooring with noise reduction capabilities while adding comfort underfoot for homeowners against drafty rooms or noisy neighbors.
Bamboo is perfect for high-traffic areas like entranceways, kitchens, and living rooms. Bamboo flooring needs to be refinished less often than several other popular types of substances utilized. Bamboo wood is light in color and has varying grains; this enables it to fit in the design of any room it is placed in.
Bamboo D√©cor
In addition, bamboo hardwood flooring comes in various styles and finishes so that homeowners can choose one based on their preferences and living environment. Manufacturers also continually create new styles to keep up with the latest interior design trends.
Bamboo flooring also has a rustic feel that appeals to homeowners who like natural elements in their home d√©cor. The highly textured surface of these floors helps reduce slip risks for homes with children, especially during their early years when they are more prone to accidents.

Another great way to clean hardwood floors is by buffing and coating them. When you buff and coat your hardwood floor, you‚Äôll protect it from dirt and scratches. You can use a buffing machine, or you can hand-buff your floors.
#3 Hardwood Floor Refinishing
If your hardwood floors start to look dull, you may want to refinish them. Refinishing is the process where you remove the old finish from your floors and apply a new one. This process will give your hardwood floors a fresh, new look.
#4 Vacuum Cleaner
Vacuuming your hardwood floors is another great way to keep them clean. A vacuum cleaner will remove all the dirt and dust accumulated on your floors. You can use a handheld vacuum or a canister vacuum.

What kinds of hardwood can be restored?
Most hardwood floors can be restored, including oak, maple, cherry, walnut, and hickory. The specific type and condition of the hardwood will determine the restoration process and its outcome.
Some factors that affect restoring old hardwood floors may include:
- the age of the floor
- the finish on the floor
- the condition of the floor
Still, wondering how to repair old hardwood floors? Let Hudson Hardware do the job for you. We know the best way to restore hardwood floors.
What is the best way to restore oak or maple hardwood floors?
How to restore old hardwood floors made of oak or maple:
Here are the steps we take to restore white oak hardwood floors and maple floors.
- Clean the floor: Before starting the restoration process, clean the floor thoroughly. Sweep or vacuum the floor to remove any dirt, dust, or debris. You can also use a mild cleaner to clean the floor if it‚Äôs necessary.
- Sand the floor: Sanding helps to remove any scratches, stains, or uneven surfaces on the floor. Use a floor sander to sand the floor. Start with coarse-grit sandpaper and move to finer grit progressively.
- Fill the gaps: Do any old wood floor repairs that are needed. If there are any gaps or holes in the oak or maple, fill them with wood filler. Allow the filler to dry, and then sand it smooth.
- Stain the floor: Staining enhances the natural beauty of the maple or oak wood floors. Pick a stain color for the flooring restoration that matches the rest of the house or the desired aesthetic. Stain the floor using a brush or roller, following the instructions on the stain.
- Apply the finish: Apply a finish to protect the stained floor. The finish could either be polyurethane or wax, choose the one that suits your needs. Apply the finish in a thin and even coat, following the instructions on the finish.
- Allow to dry: Lastly, allow the floor to dry, and avoid walking on the floor for the recommended drying period.
What is the best way to restore pine floors?
Refinishing pine floors is another story. Pine floors are milled differently than other kinds of wood. Most likely, pine floors can not be restored or refinished with the same results, as say oak floors.
The reason why is that pine floors were originally meant to be sub-flooring.
In many Philadelphia homes, people still do choose to revive wood floors of pine ‚Äì much like more traditional hardwood floors. They often have gaps and expansion, which makes it a more difficult process. While some shy away from restoring pine, it can be done.
For example: if your pine floors have already been refinished by a wood floor restorer, then there is a way to give your floors some new life. We can add a finish with a buff and coat. This will add durability and shine. While it won‚Äôt make the pine floors look new, it can give your floor a fun ‚Äúrustic‚Äù look. Many customers love the look!
Can you restore bamboo or Brazilian cherry hardwood floors?
Yes, bamboo and Brazilian cherry floors can all be restored. They are all gorgeous woods that can be stunning when restored. The extent of the restoration needed will depend on the condition of the floors.
For minor scratches and dullness, professional cleaning and buffing may be all that is needed. For more significant damage like deep scratches or stains, sanding and refinishing may be necessary.
Brazilian cherry wood floors
Sometimes, clients would prefer a different tone for their Brazilian cherry floors. We understand this and can reduce some of the ‚Äúredness‚Äù. We specialize in altering the color of Brazilian Cherry floors.
Altering coloring on a floor needs to be left to the pros, for sure. It can be quite challenging to get the exact tone. We can do this for you.
Bamboo Floors
Refinishing old wood floors made of bamboo can usually have beautiful results! They usually have a formaldehyde finish on them, which can be harmful and hazardous to your health, though. Hudson Hardware can remove this layer and refinish the floors while using containment methods to protect the air in your home. Definitely do not try redoing floors made of bamboo on your own.
Other Exotic Hardwood Floors
We refinish all exotic hardwood floors, such as Brazilian Walnut, Purple Heart, and Australian Cypress. They give a truly unique look to a home.
Exotic floors are often darker in color. They have natural resins in the wood that can make it more challenging to have the stain and finish adhere for restoration. However, we have specific products and equipment to get this done.
Why it is better to restore hardwood floors, rather than replace
Besides restoring historic charm and beauty, there are several reasons why it may be better to restore your hardwood floor rather than replace it.
- Cost-effective: Restoring or floor refinishing cost is often cheaper than replacing it. This is because the cost of materials and labor required to replace the floor can add up quickly. On the other hand, restoration usually only requires sanding, refinishing, and minor repairs.
- Preservation of character: Hardwood floors can add character and charm to a home. If your home has an older hardwood floor, wood floor refinishers preserve this unique feature rather than replacing it with a new, generic floor.
- Environmental benefits: When you replace a floor, the old materials often end up in a landfill. Restoration, on the other hand, can be done using eco-friendly methods and materials. This reduces waste and the environmental impact of the project.
- Convenience: Restore and repair old hardwood floors can often be done in a fraction of the time it takes to replace them. When you refinish old hardwood floors you have less disruption to your daily routine and a faster completion time.
Overall, restoring old hardwood flooring can be a great option for those looking to give their Philadelphia home a nice update. It‚Äôs cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and can preserve the character of your home.

Worn-looking hardwood might need to be cleaned and then recoated. If the floor is in a poor condition or damaged, options include restoration, refinishing and repair.
Working with a professional will help ensure your hardwood floors are restored to their original beauty, and will stay like that for a long time.
Cleaning and Recoating vs Restoration, Refinishing and Repair
Before deciding what to do with your hardwood floor, you should first know some of the terms used in the hardwood flooring industry. A professional might inform you that the floors need to be repaired, they should be restored, or they need refinishing. Perhaps they will tell you the floor simply needs cleaning and recoating.
Let‚Äôs take a closer look at some of these terms, so you have a better idea about what your hardwood floors might need:
- Repairs: If the hardwood itself is damaged, the floors will need to be repaired. There might be damage in some areas only, such as spills, water damage, mold, pet accidents or fire. In this case, the damaged part will need to be replaced. It is not always easy to locate an exact replacement, and this would depend on the type and age of the floor. However, a professional can locate the right species of wood and stain it so it matches well with the rest of the floor.
- Restoration or Refinishing: These terms are interchangeable. If the hardwood floor is in a reasonable condition but has sun damage, splintering, dents, scratches or buckling, it might be possible to fix those without actually having to replace part of the floor. Restoring or refinishing mean the floors will be sanded down until smooth and flat without leaving any scratches. After this they can be stained with whichever color you like and finished with the sheen of your choice.
- Cleaning and Recoating: If the floor is in good condition but looks rather worn or dull, or has light scratches, a clean and recoat should be all it needs. This is the cheapest option but it is only done when the floor is in good shape. When cleaning and recoating the hardwood floor, your floor will be scuffed lightly in order to remove grime and imperfections that might be caused by normal wear and tear. After this, the floor gets a fresh coat of finish in whichever sheen you prefer.
How are Hardwood Floors Repaired?
As long as the floor hasn‚Äôt already been refinished several times, repair can be performed regardless of the age of the floor. Typical repairs would include wall or radiator removal from a remodel, pet stains or deep gauges which are too deep for refinishing.
A large area of damage might mean it is cheaper to invest in new hardwood flooring in that room. A hardware flooring professional will see which planks or boards must be repaired or replaced.
Fixing a Squeaky Hardwood Floor
Any floor squeaks are the result of a gap between the sub floor and the hardwood floor. This gap is caused by poorly acclimated floors or the house settling.
A squeak can be fixed by inserting a wedge or shim between the bottom of the sub floor and the top of the floor joist. Although you can buy special screws to fix the floor from the top surface, these are gimmicky and probably won‚Äôt last long if they even work at all.
Hardwood Floor Restoration or Refinishing
It is possible to restore any wooden floor, even old ones, as long as the wood is still thick enough. This type of restoration is done to restore the look of the floor back to its original splendor. It can be hard to tell whether the wood is thick enough but a professional will know if restoration or refinishing is a possibility.
If you can see silver-colored, brushed nail heads on the surface of the wood, that means the floor has been refinished already. Usually these nails are well below the surface and seeing them may mean the wood might not be thick enough to restore any more.
Solid planks of hardwood are typically between 5/16‚Äô and 3/4‚Äù inch thick. Refinishing removes some of this thickness, although it is necessary every now and then to ensure the floors stay in good condition.
The refinishing process is needed on average every seven to ten years, for most hardwood floors. Some might need to be refinished more while others might need much less, depending on the care taken to keep the floors looking good and how much foot traffic they have.
How to Clean and Recoat a Hardwood Floor
If your hardwood floors are cleaned and recoated every two years, you should not have to refinish them. Grimy, dull, uneven or lightly scratched floors can be restored to their original beauty with a simple cleaning and recoating.
Complete the process with a fresh coat of finish and the floors should look brand new again, or at least in a very good condition.
Can I Clean and Recoat Hardwood Floors Myself?
If you have a budget or you prefer to DIY when possible, you might be wondering whether you can do your own cleaning and recoating. There are even videos online showing you how to restore, repair, refinish or clean the floors.
However, because you are dealing with an expensive, highly visible and important part of the house and don‚Äôt want to risk ruining the floors, it is always recommended that you call an experienced professional.
A DIY floor can be challenging, here are the common hurdles:
Tricky Equipment to Use in the Wrong Hands
It isn‚Äôt easy to work on hardwood flooring. The equipment you will need can be hard to use and it is heavy. If you make a mistake with the equipment the flooring could be damaged beyond repair, which is going to cost even more in the long run.
Contaminants in the Floor
Sanding down wood makes dust which is going to spread all over the room and beyond, so it needs to be done carefully. A respirator should be worn when sanding, as well as when applying stain and finish coats.
A professional flooring contractor will use plastic barriers as well as dust containment including HEPA filtration. This can eliminate up to 98.9% of the dust which is inevitable during sanding.
Specialized Tools for Hardwood Repair
You can‚Äôt refinish a hardwood floor with a hand sander, because of its sheer size. You need a large sander. You can rent these from big box stores but they are hard to use, have to be brought to and from your house, and they are really heavy as well.
A hardwood floor sanding machine needs to be connected to your electrical panel by an expert since these machines need a high voltage, higher than what a typical wall outlet gives.
If you add up the cost of the tools, rental costs and other supplies, as well as the time it will take you, plus the risk of making an expensive mistake, you will probably want to hire a professional hardwood floor contractor to make sure everything is done well and make the process a hassle-free one.",hudsonhardwood

72,https://hudsonhardwood.com/blog/common-hardwood-floor-challenges/,"Hardwood floors are a beautiful aspect of any room and are great for any business or home. They can last for generations. Therefore you want to take good care of them to keep them in top shape. Still, some people may find some aspects of hardwood floor care challenging. Here are 5 common hardwood floor challenges to look out for.
Water Damage
A few common issues with hardwood floors are water damage, matching existing colors and styles, and maintenance. Pennsylvania weather spans the gamut from hot and humid summers to cold and dry winters. All of this can affect your hardwood floors. Stains, discoloration, and even buckling of individual boards can occur. Hardwood floor refinishing can repair this.
Scratches
Scratching damages the surface of your hardwood, making it visually unappealing and more difficult to clean. Maintaining hardwood floors does take some care and effort. Keeping them clean and free of debris can greatly help reduce scratching. Regularly cleaning and recoating your hardwood floors, also known as a ‚Äúbuff and coat,‚Äù will give them life for years to come.
Oxidation
Hardwood oxidation is a process in which hardwood becomes darker, particularly when exposed to the sun. This usually occurs in the first years after installation. Homeowners may find oxidation unappealing since it alters the color of the hardwood. To avoid it, make sure you control the intake of sunlight your hardwood has. You can move around furniture or close curtains.
Loose Or Noisy Boards
Loose or noisy boards can be an annoyance. They can cause people to trip or disrupt your home with noise. Loose or noisy boards can worsen over time, especially if you‚Äôre unaware of an underlying cause. A hardwood floor restoration can determine the best way to fix this problem and solve it.
Humidity Changes Affecting The Boards
Humidity changes can affect your hardwood floors, making them expand, contract, or even crack. You might notice this difference in your floor with how they look or feel when you walk on them. A good way to avoid this is by ensuring you get quality hardwood floors and controlling the humidity levels inside your home.

74,https://hudsonhardwood.com/blog/dark-or-ligh-flooring/,"When it comes to flooring, homeowners tend to get overwhelmed by the number of choices out there. Most people don‚Äôt know what they want until they get to see it first hand. Do you want a light or dark floor in your house? Which one will look better?
It‚Äôs no secret that choosing the right flooring for your house is crucial. So, in this blog post, we‚Äôll share with you the pros and cons of light and dark flooring so that you can choose what‚Äôs best for your home.
Dark Vs. Light Flooring: Which One Is Best For You
Dark Flooring
The Pros
- It is very noticeable when dirt, dust, or other dark debris gets down into your flooring. A natural dark color, wood floors will hide these bits of ickiness until they are swept up and removed, making it easy to clean and touch up.
- A dark floor creates a great contrast with light-colored walls and furniture, giving your space depth.
- Natural dark flooring is resistant to stains and scratches, so even if you don‚Äôt clean it often or thoroughly, your floors will still look beautiful.
- Dark flooring is often used in high-end homes to give them an elegant look.
The cons
- If you have a kitchen with dark cabinets and want to go with a natural dark wood floor, it can be hard to combine them. Besides, it would look monotonous.
- Dark floors tend to make rooms look smaller, so if you‚Äôre looking for something that opens up your space, dark flooring isn‚Äôt the best choice.
- Light-colored debris can be very noticeable on dark flooring.
Light Flooring
The pros
- Wood light floors look and feel natural, so it‚Äôs a great choice if you want to go for an organic style.
- If your home looks dark inside, light flooring can brighten it up and make you feel more comfortable.
- If you‚Äôre looking to give the illusion that your room is larger than it is, light flooring might be the way to go.
The cons
- Dark-colored stains may be messy on your light floors if you have pets or kids who like to get creative.
- If you want to enjoy your flooring for a long time or don‚Äôt have the budget to give it the proper maintenance, light flooring is not for you since it fades faster than dark ones do.
- If your room is a large open space with plenty of natural light, all that light will bounce off light wood floors, and it will create a washed-out or glaring effect.

Take a small amount of the wax and apply it to the plastic putty knife. Push the mixture down with your finger, then press it in place. To remove any extra wax from the floor, push the flat end of the tool to the knife and scrape away.
Step #5
Take the cotton fabric and gently buff the flooring to eliminate any excess material or wax left on the floor. Ensure you‚Äôre doing this very, very lightly so that you‚Äôre not removing the wax you simply pushed into the scrape on the floor.
Step #6
If these tips and tricks do not give you the result you desired, be sure to get professional hardwood floor refinishing. A hardwood floor refinishing will erase the scratch and make your floors look brand new.
Refinishing starts with sanding and polishing your hardwood until all scrapes, scratches, gouges, & stains are removed, uncovering a like-new wood floor. Then, a hardwood floor coating will give it an updated, fresh look.

77,https://hudsonhardwood.com/blog/floor-installation-how-to-prepare-for-it/,"It can be complicated to know where to start when getting ready for a floor installation. You need to take care of so many things before the process starts, and some homeowners might get nervous about it since they believe it will make them stressed out and their homes will be a complete mess. But, it‚Äôs not as bad as you think!
Working with a professional company can take a lot of that stress away from you. Still, there are some steps that everyone should take to make the process even easier on themselves and those installing your new flooring.
In this blog, we‚Äôll share some ways to prepare your home before a floor installation begins so everything goes smoothly and without any trouble at all!
5 Ways To Prepare For Your Floor Installation
1 ‚Äì Ensure Your Pet‚Äôs Safety
Before a floor installation, you need to ensure your pet‚Äôs safety is taken into account. Pets can be curious and might get in the way of the workers or try to eat the new flooring, so it‚Äôs best to keep them out of the room altogether or put them in another room with a closed door. However, make sure the room is not too small because after being there for too long they can get stressed.
If you‚Äôd like to keep your pets in the room, make sure there‚Äôs a separate place to go if they get scared or try to interfere with the installation. By doing this, you‚Äôll help everyone stay safe and calm!
2 ‚Äì Remove Valuable & Delicate Items From The Room
You must remove all valuables and delicate items from the room. This includes anything breakable such as vases, antiques, and electronics since they could get damaged by a worker dropping something heavy on them.
3 ‚Äì Think About Your Floor Height
When choosing your flooring, think about the height of the new floor compared to the old one. If there‚Äôs a big difference, you might need to adjust some things before installation begins. For example, if your old floor was at a lower height and you installed a new floor that is significantly taller, your door frames might need to be adjusted, or you might have to replace the bottom of your doors.
4 ‚Äì Remove Your Furniture
This one is pretty self-explanatory! You‚Äôll need to remove all of your furniture from the room before workers come in to install your new flooring. This includes sofas, tables, chairs ‚Äì everything needs to go. You can always put your furniture back into the room once the installation is complete, but it‚Äôs best to remove it for the time being.
5 ‚Äì Prepare For Waste Disposal
Some waste materials will need to go, so make sure you‚Äôre prepared for this. If there‚Äôs any trash in the room, like broken pieces or ripped-up boxes, that needs to go, be sure you have a place for all of it. This might mean buying extra garbage bags or boxes so that everything can get disposed of on time.
Get Your Floor Installation With Professionals
By following these tips, your floor installation will go smoothly and without any trouble at all! The best you can do is schedule your floor installation with a professional company, like Hudson Hardwood, that can guide you on preparing for the process.
At Hudson Hardwood, we have more than 20 years of experience with flooring services, including installing hardwood floors that will last you a lifetime!

From types of wood to colors and finishes, people reflect their tastes and view of trends in their choices. Discover the flooring trends for the next year and how they affect hardwood floorings.
The return to natural materials
There is a trend going back to natural materials. People are interested in products that come from the Earth, which means that there is an increase in the popularity of hardwood flooring over other materials. The variety of colors and textures available with hardwood makes it a desirable option for many people. In addition, because hardwood is a natural product, it will always be in style.
While oak and maple will always be popular choices for hardwood flooring, people are also looking for more exotic woods like Brazilian cherry, tigerwood, and others. These woods offer a unique look that can enhance the appearance of a room. They are also very durable and can withstand any wear and tear.
The Return To Antiquity
This trend can be seen in many things, not just hardwood flooring. People are interested in the styles and designs from centuries ago. This is reflected in the popularity of vintage or antique furniture and the increasing demand for hardwood flooring with reclaimed wood. Reclaimed wood is wood that has been recycled from old buildings or furniture.
Reclaimed wood has a unique look and texture that you cannot find in any other type of wood. If you already have the old flooring, hardwood floor restoration services are ideal to bring back to life an antique hardwood flooring and make it look as good as new.
Colorful Coatings
While many people prefer a natural look for their hardwood flooring, that is not to say that they cannot add a pop of color. There are now a variety of coatings that can be applied to wood floors that will add color and personality. These coatings can match or contrast with the walls or furniture in a room. Hardwood floor refinishing services are great for applying a colorful coat to an already installed floor.

With more people hanging out at home during the holidays and the winter season, they are spending more time looking at all of the things they have wanted to fix, upgrade, or change in their homes. For some, this means flooring. If you‚Äôre ready to remodel your home or flip that house, you‚Äôll need the latest scoop on which floors are gaining more popularity and recognition.
Hardwood floors are durable and can switch up the aesthetic of nearly any room. They upgrade the look of a room and usually become more interesting and attractive throughout the years. Knowing which trends are around the corner can significantly assist in picking out the floor that is going to elevate the style and look of your home. Continue reading to see what to expect for hardwood flooring trends in 2021.
Larger Planks. Natural Finish
Surveys conducted throughout the industry demonstrate a desire for longer and wider planks that have a natural finish. Almost 45% agree that natural finishes will continue to increase in demand for the upcoming years, while 57% expect a spike in the demand for wider planks. People are moving away from the warmer tones in hardwood floors and moving towards cooler, more natural-looking finishes.
Expect to see a lot of dark-colored woods that add interest and contrast to the room. It is one of the top two stains that homeowners request when installing or refinishing hardwood floors. Along with natural finishes, you can expect to also see more natural textures. Unfinished and textured woods continue to trend upwards, while the demand for exotic varieties is seemingly in favor of domestic woods.
Is the Gray Here to Stay?
Gray-colored floors have been a staple for the past few years. Though hardwood floor trends tend to last for about five years, grays have been a prominent choice for the past 6-7 years. This color seems to go very well with current and popular home d√©cor styles, which is why this design option may have hung around for so long.
While the trend is still here for 2021, gray floors are approaching their final days. They are beginning to wane in popularity, and it is likely that within a few years, they are going to develop a reputation for being tired or outdated. This means that it may be in your best interest to look for something with a little more longevity.
Lighter Styles To Match D√©cor
Lighter styles are gaining in popularity and are, currently, one of the top two stains selected when installing or refinishing hardwood floors. People are beginning to move away from the dramatics of very dark hardwood floors in favor of simpler and more modern lighter finishes. As the preferred home d√©cor styles continue to move towards more modern and simple designs, the demand for a clean look continues to grow.
As people continue to demand natural and organic-looking hardwood floors, they are willing to play with texture and a lighter degree of scrape. Still, they want their finishes matte, muted, and less imposing. For these options, oak is king. As domestic hardwoods continue to maintain their cost, availability, and quality, expect to see many oak floors being installed ‚Äì especially white oak.
Changing Perspectives
Something that is getting a surprising boost in hardwood flooring is the use of patterns in new floors. Those remodeling their homes are going for unexpected quirks and subtle unique touches to add character and personality to their home. This is becoming evident in their choices for hardwood floor installation techniques.
As people value the quality of uniqueness, originality, and variety within their homes, this trend is spreading to hardwood flooring choices, as well. Fresh and trendy hardwood flooring patterns provide the desired contemporary good looks with a versatility that has not been seen before, and quite frankly, hasn‚Äôt been popular in a long time.
You can expect to see herringbone ‚Äì a classic that is finding its way back to ‚Äútrendy‚Äù status. This is a nice alternative to straight hardwood planking, which leads to a nice pattern that brings sophistication and timelessness to any room. It‚Äôs simply irresistible. Another upcoming trend is laying the floor from a diagonal perspective. Rather than laying the planks at a ninety-degree angle in relation to the wall, the planks are shifted to a forty-five-degree angle. This quick trick gives your home a more contemporary feel. Just know that this can cost more as this design require more labor and more materials are needed as this design produces more waste.
Mixing It Up With Planks
In addition to wider and longer planks, another surprising trend on the rise is the use of mixed plank widths. This unexpected trend is rolling over from 2020 as another quirky, character-filled touch to people‚Äôs homes. Alternating different widths of hardwood flooring to a room can add depth and a little more style. Using different widths of the same hardwood flooring gives a subtle but pleasantly unexpected design detail to space. However, it should be noted that the widths aren‚Äôt entirely random and require an entire row must be installed using planks with the same width.
The Bottom Line
Hardwood flooring will be taking on more personality as we move into 2021. People are favoring natural and organic styles with more unfinished and unrefined characteristics as home d√©cor styles move in the same direction. As home d√©cor styles continue to trend towards minimalist designs with an emphasis on eco-friendly designs and sources, flooring is going to move in a similar path to match the needs of the home d√©cor trends.",hudsonhardwood

Hardwood Flooring Pros
- Hardwood floors are timeless and classic. They add value to your home; thanks to hardwood floor refinishing, you can restore them multiple times if they become scratched or damaged.
- Hardwood floors are easier to clean than carpets and don‚Äôt require special cleaning solutions or vacuums.
- Hardwoods are a natural product and are therefore eco-friendly. The source of most hardwoods comes from sustainably managed forests.
- Hardwood floors can be restored easily with hardwood floor refinishing services if they become damaged, which makes them a long-lasting investment.
- Many people find hardwood floors have a more unique, luxurious look than other types of flooring.
Hardwood Flooring Cons
- Hardwood floors can be expensive, especially if you choose premium wood species like mahogany or walnut.
- Unlike vinyl or laminate floors, hardwoods can‚Äôt be installed as a ‚Äúfloating‚Äù floor, so they need to be glued or nailed down. This can make installation more time-consuming.
Vinyl Flooring Pros
- Vinyl is one of the most affordable flooring options on the market. It‚Äôs also effortless to install, saving you money on installation costs.
- Vinyl floors are water resistant, making them ideal for rooms like kitchens and bathrooms with much moisture.
- Many vinyl floors come in plank form, which gives them a similar look to hardwood floors.
Vinyl Flooring Cons
- Vinyl floors can‚Äôt be refinished like hardwood floors, so they‚Äôll need to be replaced when they become scratched or damaged.
- While some types of vinyl contain recycled materials, they‚Äôre not considered eco-friendly like some hardwoods because they come from petroleum products.
Choose Hardwood Flooring Over Vinyl For Your Floor

Even with proper maintenance, the wear and tear of everyday life can take its toll on your hardwood flooring. When the damage is too much, it‚Äôs time to replace them with a new hardwood floor installation. Discover here when it‚Äôs time to replace a hardwood floor.
5 Signs You Should Replace Your Hardwood Floors
You might wonder how you can know if you need to replace your floor. Here are 5 signs to look for that will tell you when it‚Äôs time to get a replacement.
1. Discoloration or Fading
Sometimes hardwood floor refinishing isn‚Äôt enough. If you see discoloration or fading in one spot, it could be a sign of deep staining or warping beneath the surface. Sun exposure can also cause discoloration or fading over time if blinds or curtains don‚Äôt properly cover windows.
2. Cupping
Cupping usually occurs due to an uneven moisture distribution within the wood itself, causing some boards to cup up while others sink. This creates an uneven surface that can be felt throughout the flooring and makes it uncomfortable to walk barefoot.
3. Cracking
Cracks are caused by various issues, such as extreme changes in temperature and humidity, excessive humidity levels, lack of proper care and upkeep, or even just regular wear and tear over time.
4. Creaking
Loose nails or screws used to attach the boards can cause creaking. Creaking is most common in older homes where the floor may not have been installed properly initially. Still, it can happen with newer hardwood floors due to everyday use and wear and tear on the flooring.
5. Uneven Surface
Uneven surfaces could indicate that your subfloor has become unstable due to moisture seeping underneath. Moisture can enter due to plumbing leaks or water damage from flooding in your home.

There‚Äôs a growing trend to change carpet stairs and get a hardwood stair installation. While both options have their advantages and disadvantages, there are many reasons why hardwood stairs are a better choice. Discover the pros and cons of a better choice if you swap your carpet stairs for a wood staircase.
Elegance
One of the biggest advantages of hardwood stairs is that they look great and add character to any space. They provide a clean, elegant aesthetic perfect for modern homes or traditional spaces alike. In addition, hardwood steps are more durable than carpets, making them ideal for high-traffic areas where spills and stains are common.
Cleaning
On the other hand, carpets may be softer on your feet and offer better insulation in colder climates. However, they require regular cleaning and maintenance to keep them looking fresh and attractive over time. And if you have pets or small children in your home, carpet can also be a magnet for dirt, hair, and other debris. Hardwood flooring is always easier to clean.
Durability
Hardwood stairs are also more durable than carpet, meaning they‚Äôll last longer and require less replacement. In addition, hardwood is less likely to show wear and tear, making it ideal for high-traffic areas. Carpets have a shorter lifespan and are more affected by changing trends since the elegance of hardwood floorings is timeless.
Cost
Although hardwood stairs may have a higher initial cost than carpet, they‚Äôre often cheaper in the long run, thanks to their durability and ease of maintenance. Hardwood flooring is also a great investment since it raises your home value.
Personal Taste
In the end, the choice between hardwood and carpet stairs comes down to personal preference. But if you‚Äôre looking for a durable, low-maintenance option that will look great for years to come. It‚Äôs just a timeless, elegant option that will last for generations.

Or maybe you‚Äôve been in your home for years with your floors, and you want to make sure they are there for more years to come. Either way, you want to make a decision on how to do it.
We get it, it‚Äôs a big decision. But, luckily you‚Äôre doing your research ahead of time to plan for this, rather than going for it without a plan and then having to postpone your project even longer because you weren‚Äôt prepared.
You can do it yourself if you‚Äôre up for it, or you can have your floors refinished by a professional team with minimal interruption to your home. It really depends on what will work with your timeframe and budget.
So how long can you expect it to take to refinish your hardwood floors? The simple answer is, it depends. We know, not the answer you were looking for.
You have a few things to consider:
- The age of the hardwood.
Newer hardwood floors will be easier to sand down, whereas older floors have had more time to harden, adhere to the sealant, and may have some damages that need to be repaired. So before you start, you need to consider how old your floors are, and what condition they are in to begin with.
- The size of the area.
Obviously the more hardwood flooring you are refinishing, the longer it will take. It is always a good idea to measure out how much total square footage you will be replacing. A general rule of thumb is that a team can sand anywhere between one thousand and two thousand square feet of hardwood per day.
- The type of finish you are putting on the floor.
Oil-Based polyurethanes can take twice as long to dry as water-based. If there is any stain going on the hardwood it can also add an extra day to the project. On average it can take three to five days for oil-based, and up to two days for water-based. There are other finishes that can be done on hardwood floors, but they require timelines unique to them.
There are also other little things to consider like, how much furniture you will have to keep moving, any damage spots in the floor that need to be repaired before the floors can be refinished, and all of the dust being cleaned up before the refinishing process can start.
All in all, it can be a big undertaking. But with some dedication and hardwork, you can have those beautiful refinished hardwood floors be in your home for years to come, looking good as new.",hudsonhardwood

Are you a Philadelphia homeowner with hardwood floors? It‚Äôs important to keep them looking their best.
With time and wear, hardwood floors can lose their shine and appeal. But don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì there are ways to bring back that shine!
There are two popular methods for revitalizing and maintaining hardwood floors:
- Buff and coat
- Refinishing
In this comprehensive guide, we‚Äôll explore the benefits and drawbacks of each method and provide instructions for cleaning and re-coating or refinishing your hardwood floors.
We‚Äôll also share some tips and tricks from the pros for maintaining your floors‚Äô cleanliness, and address some common concerns in our FAQ section.
So, when hiring a professional, this guide from Hudson Hardware will help you choose the best floor-cleaning solution for your specific situation.
Let‚Äôs get started!
First, let‚Äôs define the two methods.
What is the buff and coat method?
Buff and coat, also known as screen and recoat, involves lightly sanding and applying a new coat of finish with a hard floor buffer to the surface of the hardwood floor.
This method is ideal for floors with minor scratches and wear and tear and can be done quickly and affordably. Think of it as a hardwood floor maintenance coat.
- Benefits: The buff and coat method can greatly extend the life of your hardwood floor! It will nicely refresh the top layer of polyurethane ‚Äì a buffed floor is perfect for cleaning old wood floors without refinishing.
- Drawbacks: The buff and coat method can deep clean hardwood floors, but it can not remove larger issues, like deep gouges, big scratches or large areas of damage from water, heat, and fire, or marks from pets.
Try this method first if you wonder how to get wood floors to shine.
What is the refinishing method?
Refinishing, on the other hand, involves sanding the entire floor down to the bare wood and reapplying stain and finish.
This floor restoration method is best for floors with deep scratches, stains, or water damage, and can significantly enhance the look and durability of your hardwood floors.
- Benefits: The refinishing method can get rid of even the toughest damage. And, it is much cheaper than replacing your flooring.
- Drawbacks: Dust! There is no way to avoid dust, however we use dust containment that contains 90% of the dust. Check out our video on how minimal the dust issue is: How Much Dust Should I Expect.
Things to consider
Before deciding on which method to use, we consider:
- The age and condition of your floors
- Your budget
- Your time constraints
It‚Äôs also important to properly prepare and clean the floors before starting any restoration project.
With the right tools and techniques, we can restore the shine and beauty to your hardwood floors for you to enjoy their elegance and durability for years to come.
6 Tips and Tricks for maintaining your floors‚Äô Cleanliness
Wondering how to deep clean wood floors, or how to shine dull wood floors?
To maintain the cleanliness and shine of your natural hardwood floors, there are some tips and tricks that you can follow:
- Vacuum your floors regularly to prevent dirt and dust from accumulating. Don‚Äôt sweep your floors, vacuum them with a hardwood floor vacuum. Or a vacuum that has a bare floor/hardwood floor setting. This means the brush roller will not be running.
- The best thing to mop floors with is a flat damp mop with natural wood floor cleaner to clean your floors, but avoid using too much water as it can cause water damage. Be sure to use a flat mop. You should only use as much water/clean or mixture on the floor as you would use on your mirrors.
- Look for the best natural floor cleaner: use a pH-neutral cleaner specifically designed for hardwood floors to remove stains and spills.
- For hardwood floor deep cleaning, avoid using furniture polish, wax, or oil-based cleaners, as they can build up on the surface of the wood and create a dull appearance. Stick to natural hardwood floor cleaners, like silicone cleaners. They include products like mop and glo, orange glo, etc.
- Try having a professional buff your hardwood floors before and after large gatherings in your home. Since only professionals have a buffer we recommend the moping and vacuuming tips above.
- Put protective pads on the legs of your furniture to prevent scratches and dents on the surface of your floors.
- Place rugs and mats in high-traffic areas to protect your floors from wear and tear.
By following these tips and tricks, you‚Äôll be able to keep your hardwood floors looking their best for many years to come!
Further tips
Now that we‚Äôve covered how to deep clean wooden floors, here are some further tips to keep your floor looking pristine:
- Don‚Äôt drag heavy furniture across your hardwood floors, as this can cause scratches and dents. Instead, lift the furniture or use furniture sliders to move it around.
- Avoid wearing high heels or cleats on your hardwood floors, as they can leave deep scuffs and scratches on the surface of the wood.
- If you have pets, keep their nails trimmed to prevent them from scratching the floors.
- Consider using a humidifier to maintain a consistent level of humidity in your home, as fluctuations in humidity can cause your hardwood floors to warp or crack over time.
In summary
Taking care of your hardwood floors requires regular cleaning, preventative measures, and being mindful of potential hazards that can damage the surface over time.
By following these tips, you can ensure that your floors remain beautiful and durable for years to come.

However, if you want it to look even better, there are some crucial steps you need to follow. The first step to changing your bamboo floor is starting with the basics: cleaning it. As something that‚Äôs made for us to walk over, it‚Äôs pretty common that it will get real dirty soon. Floors can get dirty, from mud and dirt to spills and stains.
If you‚Äôve never cleaned a bamboo floor before, don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì we‚Äôll share why it‚Äôs important to clean it and how to do so in this blog!
Why You Should Clean Your Bamboo Floor
Bamboo floors are a beautiful and sustainable flooring option. However, they require extra care to keep them looking their best because they‚Äôre susceptible to being warped, making them look dull and old. Dirt and dust can get ground into the bamboo flooring, which will wear down the finish over time.
But besides the aesthetic aspect of it, it‚Äôs important to clean them since it‚Äôs a natural material. If there‚Äôs an excess of moisture in your home, it can produce mold growth, which is harmful to you and your family since it can cause severe allergies and other health risks. It‚Äôs important to clean your bamboo floor regularly to prevent this from happening.
How To Properly Clean Your Bamboo Floor
Now that you‚Äôve identified why it‚Äôs important to clean your bamboo floor, you‚Äôre ready to learn how to do it properly. Here are the steps:
- Using a vacuum, broom, or microfiber mop, you should clean the floor from all debris and dust.
- It would help if you got a bamboo floor cleaning solution to clean your floor without damaging it. To remove marks, you can also use white vinegar mixed with water. However, it would be best if you were careful with this technique sparingly; otherwise, the vinegar‚Äôs acidity can dull the finish of your floor over time.
- You should spray the floor solution and clean it using a slightly damp mop. By cleaning your floor in circular patterns and making sure you‚Äôre adding extra pressure into areas with more dirt or grime, your floor will shine bright like a diamond!

Many homes have carpeted stairs, which can be both convenient and stylish. However, over time carpets may become worn or stained, making them difficult to clean and requiring replacement more often than other types of flooring. Hardwood stairs are a more durable and easy-to-maintain option that can last for many years with proper care.
Converting your carpeted stairs to hardwood is a project you can complete on the weekend with some basic tools and materials. Discover here how to do it.
1. Decide On A Type Of Hardwood
The first step in converting your carpeted stairs to a wood staircase is choosing the type of wood you want. The most popular materials for this project are oak, maple, cherry, and walnut. Consider factors such as overall appearance, durability, and cost when deciding.
2. Remove Carpet And Clean
To begin the conversion process, remove any existing carpet or padding from the stair treads and risers. Once these items have been removed, thoroughly clean all surfaces to ensure they are free of dust and debris.
3. Measure And Cut
Once your stairs are clean and dry, measure each riser and tread using a tape measure to determine how much wood you need. Carefully cut your chosen material to fit around corners and banister posts, using a saw or jigsaw for precision cuts.
4. Apply Wood Adhesive And Secure
Once your wood strips are cut to size, use wood adhesive to secure them in place on the risers and treads. Use clamps to hold the pieces firmly in place while the adhesive sets, then add finishing nails or screws to ensure that they remain securely attached.
5. Complete The Project With An Application Of Finish
To complete your hardwood staircase project, apply an appropriate finish to protect against water damage and general wear and tear. Consider a durable polyurethane varnish, wax sealer,
or stain, depending on your desired look and level of protection. Your hardwood stairs will look great for many years to come with proper care!
Best To Contact A Professional For Hardwood Floor Installation
It is possible to convert your carpeted stairs to hardwood stairs on your own. However, it is best to contact a professional. Hardwood floor installation can be tricky, and improper installation can damage your stairs or cause injuries to yourself or others.

90,https://hudsonhardwood.com/blog/how-to-create-perfect-flooring/,"Homeowners always want their houses to stand out. One way to do this is by having the perfect flooring, but this can be harder than it seems. We all have seen the same old dark or light flooring designs. So, how can you improve that?
Even though the classic dark or light hardwood floors are good, you can give your house a unique look by trying flooring combinations. But how does this work? How materials or colors should you use? We know it can be overwhelming. But don‚Äôt worry!
In this blog post, we‚Äôll share with you some factors you have to consider to mix different flooring in your home so that you can achieve a stunning look.
How To Successfully Mix Different Flooring Materials
Colors Are Key!
When it comes to colors, they are key! You may combine them as much as you like since there are no set-in-stone design standards. However, some colors go well together, while others are used to create strong contrasts. For instance, for a contrasting effect, you can use brown granite, a dark natural stone, with a light-colored hardwood floor, such as pine.
Drop-Down Flooring
Maybe you want to mix specific materials that can be thicker than most materials, such as flagstone. Flagstone can be difficult to work with since the thickness varies because of the inconsistencies of its nature.
Traditional installation methods are ineffective at combining flagstone with other materials such as carpet or hardwood. However, it‚Äôs not impossible to achieve. You may use the drop-down floor approach, used by professional flooring services, to create a unique section of the floor made of floor joists that are lower than the rest of the floor.
Consider underlayment
If you‚Äôre planning to use different materials for your flooring, then you should use underlayment. Different materials don‚Äôt have the same thickness, so they‚Äôll look different. While all flooring materials don‚Äôt require underlayment, they may be utilized to raise the height of a floor to match another type.
Use Transition Strips
Transition strips are often employed between materials with different finish heights, resulting in a lip where the two meet. There are various transition strips to choose from, such as T-strips, in which the vertical portion lies between the two materials and the top horizontal section sits on top.

91,https://hudsonhardwood.com/blog/how-to-find-best-hardwood-flooring-company/,"Any home renovation can be a stressful experience. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be. If you know what to look for in a hardwood flooring company, you can ensure you complete your project quickly and easily. Here are some things to look out for that will help you find the right hardwood flooring company for your next project.
Reliable Service & Daily Job Updates
First and foremost, ensure that the company you‚Äôre working with is reliable. They should keep you updated on the progress of your project every day so you always know what‚Äôs going on. Additionally, they should be available to answer questions or address concerns.
Livable Conditions During Renovation
Secondly, you want to ensure your living conditions are tolerable during renovation. The last thing you want is to come home to a construction site every day. Your contractor should take measures to minimize the impact on your daily life. This may include setting up temporary walls or using dustless sanding methods.
Environmentally Friendly Products
Another important consideration is whether or not the company uses environmentally friendly products. You should be able to have peace of mind knowing that the products used in your home are safe for you and the environment.
Furniture Moving
Additionally, you‚Äôll want to ensure that the company you‚Äôre working with offers furniture moving services. After all, who wants to move all their heavy furniture before and after a renovation? The right company will take care of everything for you so that you can sit back and relax.
Dustless Sanding
Finally, you‚Äôll want to ensure the company uses dustless sanding methods. Traditional sanding methods can create a lot of dust, which can be dangerous for your health and furniture. Dustless sanding methods eliminate this problem so you can feel safe in your home.

92,https://hudsonhardwood.com/blog/how-to-fix-scratches-in-hardwood-floors-from-a-dog/,"Hardwood floors are a fantastic flooring option. They are classic, clean, and beautiful ‚Äì but they do require a bit of upkeep, especially if you have a beloved furry friend. If you have hardwood floors, then you likely know the sound of your dog‚Äôs nails across the wood all too well. Dog scratches on hardwood floors are, at the most, a bit of a nuisance and a little unsightly. However, those scratches are entirely fixable!
Anyone who has hardwood floors knows that every scratch that you notice tends to give you a little sting, kind of like when you buy a brand-new car, and you find the find ding or dent. Hardwood floors are no different, and when it comes to getting rid of those annoying dog scratches on hardwood floors, we are here to help! We know that you want to keep your floors as pristine as possible, which is why we are here to teach you how to keep your hardwood floors looking like new!
Pay Attention To Prevention
Do you know what is cheaper than fixing your hardwood floors? Preventing the damage in the first place. Basic, minimal care and keeping your floors clean are the initial steps to keeping scratches and scuffs to a minimum, even if Fido seems to be tap dancing along with your hardwood all day long.
By keeping your floors clean and well-kept, you will be removing dirt and grime. Because you are spending more time and paying more attention to your floors, you will likely notice any potential scratches or problem areas before the surface gets any worse. Natural hardwood floors are at a higher risk of surface damage and deterioration, so proper prevention is critical in keeping them looking perfect!
The Easy Fix
Fixing small and shallow hardwood floor scratches, and minor blemishes are relatively easy with a few DIY repair techniques. One of the easiest ways to improve a small spot, like dog scratches on hardwood, is to use a color matching marker. These markers are usually fine tip, permanent markers that are specifically designed to cover hardwood floor scratches with a wood stain pen and blending sticks. They are relatively inexpensive and are incredibly easy to use.
This is an excellent option if you aren‚Äôt too savvy with home repair, but you notice a few tiny scratches here and there. You don‚Äôt need to know any particular technique, and you can keep the marker on hand for quick and easy future repairs. The most essential factor to using these markers is finding one that matches your floor well. If you are unsure of how well the marker will match your stain or finish, try the marker in a very small area that is tucked away in a corner where no one else will see.
Hardwood Floor Scratch Removing
Most of the time, hardwood floor scratches are easy to repair ‚Äì all you need is some stain, sandpaper, and a bit of elbow grease. This method is a bit more labor-intensive and requires you to work more carefully than you would if using a pen. Those who have dog scratches on their hardwood floor that are a bit deeper may opt for this approach.
With a small can of stain, fine-grit sandpaper, and a cloth, you can easily get started. Using the fine-grit sandpaper, gently sand in the direction of the floor‚Äôs grain. Then apply a thin amount of stain, and let it sit for a few minutes. After it has had time to rest and absorb into the floor, use a clean cloth to buff out the stain. If you are nervous about using a hardwood floor stain and you have dark floors, try a walnut. Walnuts have an oily brown dye that can effectively repair scratches on your hardwood floors and even enhance the look of areas that are a bit more worn.
There are many other products that minimize the appearance of scratches and that only require the use of a cloth. These products fill in the scratches on lighter floors, much like walnut stains are used for darker tones. The great thing about repair stains is that they make it nearly impossible for anyone to see the original scratches! If you are a bit nervous to try it out yourself, give your nearest flooring professional a quick call, and they can likely help.
Fixing Deep Scratches
If your dog has done some serious damage, and you need to fix a deeper scratch, then it may require you to have some prior knowledge or skill related to repairing hardwood floors. For deeper scratches or gouges, you‚Äôll need to try a pre-colored latex wood filler. This is a good option for small but deep cuts that can be filled, stained, and finished with relative ease. Larger areas will likely require the guidance or services of a hardwood flooring professional. To protect the look and integrity of your floors, use your best judgment when making this decision.
Taking Care of Your Hardwood Floors in the Long Term
It is easy to forget that hardwood floors are pretty durable and may last throughout many generations. However, just like any other surface, they are prone to a bit of wear and tear, which is why proper cleaning and maintenance routines can keep your floors in tip top shape.
Those with dogs likely notice a bit more damage and scratches to their hardwood floors, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you are stuck with unsightly floors. There are many different ways to keep your hardwood looking nice without having to keep your dog locked up or far away. Simply stick to your cleaning and maintenance upkeep and use anyone of the techniques above that suits your problem the best. When all else fails, or you feel you may need more guidance to give a flooring professional a call, and they will have your floors looking good as new in no time.",hudsonhardwood
93,https://hudsonhardwood.com/blog/how-to-refinish-a-hardwood-floor/,"Are you looking to restore your hardwood floors to their natural beauty? You may be considering refinishing them yourself, or you may choose to hire a professional to take care of it for you. Whether you are considering spending the time and energy to do it yourself or the money to hire a professional, it helps to know what to expect.
Refinishing a hardwood floor is a pretty straightforward process. You start by sanding the floor, for which you will need a professional sander. This can usually be rented from a hardware store ‚Äì either local or a large chain. You will also need to be able to plug your sander directly in to the electrical panel. While sanding, it is essential to wear a dust mask and use plastic or drop cloths to section off the space from the rest of your house. As you sand, the sander will kick up small dust particles into the air that can get into your nose and on your furniture.
Controlling the sander is the most critical part of correctly refinishing the floors. The key is to keep the sander moving at all times. If you stop in one spot, you risk burning, denting, or gouging the floor. The sander creates a tremendous amount of heat and can damage the floor if it is not handled correctly. Another essential thing to remember is that the sander is self-propelled ‚Äì meaning this, it is going to want to keep moving.
After the floor has been sand and the old finish is removed, it is time to apply the stain and the new finish. There are usually a couple of different steps within this part of the process, including applying both the stain and the finish. If you like the color of your existing floors, you can skip the stain. However, the finish is what seals and protects the floor from any external damage.
Selecting a finish comes down to two unique options. You can choose from oil-based finishes or polyurethane finishes, also referred to as water-based. When deciding which stain to use, it is important to determine what you want your finish to accomplish. If you are looking for a warm finish with a natural glow, oil-based finishes are the way to go. They come in several different finishes, including satin, semi-gloss, and gloss. Water-based finishes don‚Äôt always have that same naturally glowing shine, but they do dry much quicker. Water-based finishes are also great at protecting hardwood floors from yellowing.
Regardless of which type of finish you choose, you must let each coat dry completely before applying the next one. If you are refinishing your own floors, default to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions when in doubt. You can usually return your furniture to the room after about 24 hours.
As you can see, refinishing a hardwood floor is a fairly involved process. It requires you to not only know how to complete it correctly, but it also requires a great deal of skill to achieve an even and natural look.",hudsonhardwood
94,https://hudsonhardwood.com/blog/how-to-refinish-your-hardwood-floors/,"If you have hardwood floors that are starting to show their age, refinishing them is a great way to bring them back to their former glory. Not only does it delete scratches and other imperfections, but it also gives the floors a fresh look. The process of hardwood floor refinishing is not difficult. Still, it is important to do it correctly to achieve the best results.
Here is a guide on how to refinish your hardwood floors:
1. Sand The Floor
You will need to rent a sander from your local hardware store. Start with coarse-grit sandpaper and then move to a finer grit. Sand the entire floor, making sure to get into all corners and crevices. Once you have finished sanding, use a vacuum to clean up all of the dust. Then, wipe the floor with a damp cloth to remove any remaining dirt or debris.
2. Apply The Stain
Now it is time to apply the stain. Make sure to wear gloves and old clothes, as the stain can be difficult to remove from clothing. Apply the stain with a brush or cloth, working in small sections. Once the stain is applied, use a rag to remove any excess. Allow the stain to dry completely before moving on to the next step.
3. Apply The Polyurethane
After the stain has dried, you will need to apply a layer of polyurethane. This will protect the floor and give it a shiny finish. Apply the polyurethane with a brush, working in small sections. Once you have finished applying the polyurethane, allow it to dry completely before moving any furniture back into the room.
Professional Services Might Be Best
While it is possible to refinish your hardwood floors yourself, it is not always the best idea. If you are not experienced in this type of work, it is easy to make mistakes that can damage the floor. It is always best to hire a professional hardwood floor refinishing company. Moreover, flooring contractors are able to detect problems and offer hardwood floor restorations as well.

In this blog post, we‚Äôll be discussing the main differences between hardwood floor refinishing and hardwood floor cleaning. We‚Äôll also provide some tips on when you might need each of these services.
Hardwood Floor Refinishing Vs. Hardwood Floor Cleaning
Hardwood flooring refinishing is a process whereby the flooring is sanded, polished, and coated with a new finish. This is typically done every few years to keep the floors looking fresh.
Hardwood floor cleaning is also known as ‚Äúbuff and coat‚Äù since the process includes a deep clean and re-coat of your hardwood floors.
When to Refinish Hardwood Floors?
Most hardwood floors will need to be refinished every few years in order to keep them looking their best. However, this timeline can vary depending on the type of hardwood floors you have.
When to Clean & Re-Coat Hardwood Floors?
You can perform hardwood floor cleaning more frequently than hardwood floor refinishing. In most cases, it‚Äôs recommended that you clean and re-coat your hardwood floors every 2-3 years. However, this timeline can vary depending on the type of flooring and the amount of traffic it receives.
Characteristics Of Hardwood Floor Refinishing
- The process of hardwood floor refinishing is typically done every few years.
- Hardwood floor refinishing involves sanding down the floors and applying a new finish.
- Refinishing hardwood floors can help protect them from damage and wear and tear.
Characteristics Of Hardwood Floor Cleaning
- Hardwood floor cleaning can be done more frequently than hardwood floor refinishing.
- Cleaning hardwood floors can help remove dirt, dust, and other debris from the surface of the floors.
- Cleaning hardwood floors can help remove short-term finishes that cloud and haze.
Main Differences Between Hardwood Floor Refinishing and Hardwood Floor Cleaning
Process
Hardwood floor refinishing is when the flooring is sanded down and then refinished with a new finish. On the other hand, with hardwood floor cleaning, rather than spending a lot of money and time on a full refinishing, you may clean, inspect scratches, and re-coat your hardwood floors for a fraction of the cost and time.
Cleaning and re-coating hardwood floors is a cost-effective alternative to full refinishing that won‚Äôt waste time, money, or effort while not removing scratches or changing color.
Frequency
Most hardwood floors will need to be refinished every 7 to 10 years in order to keep them looking their best. On the other hand, you should perform hardwood floor cleaning and re-coating every 2-3 years to extend the life of your hardwood floor.
Appearance
After hardwood floor refinishing, the floors will typically look like they have just been installed. Hardwood floor cleaning helps you improve your current finish with a higher quality and more durable one.
Sometimes, you may think you need refinishing, but you only need a hardwood floor cleaning to bring your floor back to life. Your desired floor looks and appearance depend on the amount of damage your floors have. If you‚Äôre not sure which one you need, do not hesitate to ask!

Check Your Home‚Äôs Heat Circulation
Before the cold weather hits, it‚Äôs essential to have your HVAC system checked by a professional. A functional heating system paired with hardwood flooring can provide a cozy environment for you to enjoy during the cold weather.
Protect Your Hardwood Floor From Damage
One of the best ways to keep your floors looking their best is to prevent damage from happening in the first place. You can do this by placing a shoe rack near your entryway. It‚Äôll encourage everyone at home to take their shoes off before they bring winter salt and snow into your home.

97,https://hudsonhardwood.com/blog/pros-and-cons-of-oil-based-finish-for-hardwood-floors/,"Are you taking on a hardwood floor refinishing project? One of the big decisions to make before you get started is if you want to use a water-based or oil-based polyurethane finish. In researching the best options, the vital thing to keep in mind is what type of finish will be best for your specific project.
Pros of Oil-Based Polyurethane Floors
Warm finish
For people who are looking for that warm tone that wood floors can provide, you‚Äôre going to want to use oil-based polyurethane. When it dries, it gives off that warm, earthy finish that ambers overtime.
Durable
When it comes to durability, oil-based polyurethane will stand up to heavily weighted wear and tear much better than water-based polyurethane.
Fewer coats needed
Because it is thicker than water-based polyurethane, fewer coats of oil-based polyurethane are needed when refinishing hardwood floors. Oil-based polyurethane contains 45-50% solids, which are what creates the protective finish.
More affordable
On average, an oil-based hardwood floor finish is going to cost you less money to purchase. As a bonus, because you‚Äôll need fewer coats when compared to a water-based finish, you won‚Äôt need to buy as much, which will also save you money.
Less maintenance
Because it‚Äôs much more durable than water-based polyurethane, oil-based polyurethane doesn‚Äôt have to be refinished as often. If applied correctly, an oil-based hardwood finish can last longer before needing to be redone.
Cons of Oil-Based Polyurethane Floors
Strong odor
Unfortunately, oil-based polyurethane has a strong odor when compared to water-based polyurethane. If you are sensitive to strong smells or chemicals, then an oil-based finish might irritate you.
Slow dry time
Since it‚Äôs thicker, oil-based finishes need to dry for much longer than water-based. Usually, you need to wait about 7-8 hours for oil-based finishes to dry before you can put on another coat. This means that you‚Äôll probably need several days to get the job done and then another day on top of that to wait for it to fully dry before putting furniture on top of it.
More toxic
Oil-based polyurethane contains flammable and toxic solvents. If you‚Äôre worried about using harmful chemicals for personal or environmental reasons, then you may need to rethink using oil-based polyurethane.
Hard to clean up
If you spill or drop oil-based polyurethane, you will need a specialized solvent to clean it up. Conversely, water-based polyurethane can be cleaned up with the correct cleaner.
Oil-based polyurethane is a solid choice if you‚Äôre looking for something durable that is going to give you that warm, earthy tone that many people look for in hardwood floors. However, it‚Äôs essential to weigh all of the pros and cons outlined above to ensure an oil-based finish is the right choice for your project.",hudsonhardwood
98,https://hudsonhardwood.com/blog/reclaimed-flooring/,"One of the reasons I am such a fan of wood flooring is that it is the only renewable flooring option available on the market. I was shocked when I learned that hardwood floors have a service life of a hundred years and that there are floors in parts of the United States that are over 300 years old and floors in Europe that are over 700 years old! Simply put, hardwood flooring is built to last and comes from a resource that can consistently regenerate itself and continue to produce new raw flooring materials.
The fantastic thing about wood flooring is that it can be recycled, reused, or reclaimed. By reclaiming a wood floor, you can extend the service life of nearly any type of hardwood flooring. What I appreciate most about reclaimed hardwood flooring is that it has a history. A reclaimed hardwood floor‚Äôs historical significance is found in the details like where it comes from, during which time it existed, and how its unique texture, patina, and character are entirely unmatched by any other hardwood floor ‚Äì it simply cannot be replicated.
Reclaimed wood is not just a hot topic or design trend, and it is a historical artifact with its own story to tell. When I began looking into reclaimed hardwood flooring, I wondered how much there was to learn about reclaimed floors. What did I need to know before starting on my journey to find one? One of the most significant pieces of information that I came across was that there are three main types of reclaimed hardwood flooring.
Post consumers recycled or antique reclaimed wood is a wood fiber or wood that was reclaimed after serving its original intended purpose. This wood has likely already served as a floor somewhere else. There is also salvaged wood, which comes from logs that have been salvaged from sources such as waterways, urban trees, or post-agricultural trees. The third and final type of reclaimed wood is pre-consumer recycled wood. This wood or wood fiber is constructed as a by-product from a secondary manufacturing process. This means that it has likely been regenerated from a previous hardwood floor to create a new one.
Besides learning about the different types of reclaimed hardwood, I was also curious about where it is sourced from. I learned that some reclaimed products are sourced from an old building and have quite the story to tell. Some of the most common species of reclaimed wood include American chestnut, maple, longleaf heart pine, oak, elm, cypress, walnut, and even Douglas fir.
It is essential to know precisely where your reclaimed hardwood is coming from, as many who have entered the industry are new and not as knowledgeable about how well-kept the floor was or if there are any potentially dangerous elements, such as lead paint, that were used on the floor. However, I have found that a responsible reclaimed flooring manufacturer knows how to correctly identify and prepare reclaimed hardwood so that you and I have minimal health risks when living with our historical floors.",hudsonhardwood

You need to know the potential pitfalls of doing so. Refinishing your hardwood floors can be a rewarding and satisfying experience. Still, many common mistakes can lead to costly repairs down the line. This blog post will look at 4 major hardwood refinishing mistakes and how you can avoid them.
1. Not Testing for Moisture Levels Beforehand
One of the most common mistakes in hardwood refinishing is not testing for moisture levels before beginning work. Hardwood is sensitive to moisture, and if too much of it is in the air, it can cause warping over time. You‚Äôll need a new hardwood floor installation if this happens. Before staining or varnishing, use a moisture meter on the subfloor and existing wood.
2. Skipping Over Sanding Steps
Another mistake when refinishing hardwood floors is skipping sanding steps or using the wrong sandpaper grits. This will inevitably lead to an uneven finish where some areas are smoother than others, with visible scratches left behind after staining. To ensure an even finish throughout your entire floor, go through all the stages of sanding.
3. Applying Too Much Stain or Polyurethane
Applying too much stain or polyurethane will leave your floor looking overly glossy or darken its color beyond what you originally intended. These two issues can be difficult to reverse without redoing some sections entirely. To get a better idea of how your finished product will look, always use test samples on scrap pieces of wood first.
4. Not Protecting Surroundings from Stains
Before starting any refinishing project, cover nearby walls, cabinets, and other furniture from any potential stains with plastic sheeting or drop cloths as necessary. Otherwise, you could end up causing more damage than you bargained for! It‚Äôs also important not to forget about yourself; wear protective clothing, eyewear, and masks.
Avoid All And Any Mistakes With A Pro Solution

100,https://hudsonhardwood.com/blog/refinishing-hardwood-floors/,"Refinishing hardwood floors is not the long and arduous task that most people assume. No one likes having their house ripped apart for weeks at a time during their home improvement project. It is stressful and creates a lot of disruption within your home. As this is one of the most common concerns when looking to have work completed in your home, it is easy to understand why it would be a concern for homeowners looking to start a hardwood floor refinishing project.
The timeline is always the first question a homeowner has. The great news is that most professionals can have your wood floor refinishing project completed with minimal interruption to your home or business. To give homeowners an accurate idea of how involved and how long it takes to complete a project, it is essential to know what the process looks like as there are a few different factors that determine the length of a project.
These include:
- The size of the area,
- How quickly the contractor is able to work within that space
- The amount of damage to the old floor
- The contractor‚Äôs requirements, and of course,
- Your own specifications.
The two most time-consuming factors regarding your hardwood floor refinishing project are sanding and applying a polyurethane finish to the wood.
Sanding
Sanding is one of the two most labor-intensive parts of wood floor refinishing. Your contractor has to sand every square inch of the floor to ensure that the finish goes on seamlessly and evenly. Typically, a contractor can sand about 1,500 to 2,000 square feet in a single day ‚Äì naturally, the larger the area, the longer the job takes. The state of your floor can also affect sanding times. For example, if you have a brand-new hardwood that is unfinished, it is much easier and less time-consuming to sand. In comparison, an older floor that has been treated in the past will take more time and effort.
Some of the things that can affect the required time needed to sand a hardwood floor properly are:
- Using Murphy‚Äôs Oil or other similar products on your floor. This causes a sticky buildup that makes it difficult for the sandpaper to exfoliate the wood effectively.
- Old polyurethane that has been applied in the past.
- Any previous repair work and patching were previously completed on the floor.
- If a hardwood floor has experienced moisture or another form of damage that has compromised the integrity of the wood. If the wood is warped, cupped, or rippled, it requires extra time to sand it down so that it is flat and even with the rest of the floor.
Polyurethane Finish
Another essential factor that can help determine the time required when refinishing hardwood floors is the polyurethane used to finish the hardwood. The drying time is what affects the length of the project and the majority of homeowners the most. The reason is that nothing, absolutely nothing, can be placed back on the hardwood until it has dried completely. Otherwise, homeowners run the risk of ruining all of the beautiful hard work that was just put into refinishing their floors.
There are two different kinds of polyurethane that contractors can use to refinish a floor ‚Äì oil-based and water-based. Depending on the polyurethane that you choose to complete your project, drying times can vary a few days. Here is what homeowners need to know about each type of finish.
Oil-Based Polyurethane
Oil-based polyurethane takes longer to dry than water-based. With a dry time of about 3 days from the first to the final coat, it requires 8-10 hours of drying time in between coats. For those looking to have their floors stained, add an extra work day to the project. Weather and humidity can also play a significant role in how long it takes for the polyurethane coats to dry.
After the final coat has dried for a full 8 to 10 hours, pending weather, you and your family can walk across the floor, but only with socks ‚Äì no shoes or bare feet. At a minimum, you should wait at least 12 hours before moving any furniture back into your room, and 30 days before you bring any area rugs in. This gives the floors the time they need to dry and cure properly. It is also important to try and keep your dog and their nails off the floor for about four weeks after the final coat is applied.
Water-Base Polyurethane
Water-based polyurethane typically dries quicker. Rather than taking 8 to 10 hours to dry like oil based finishes, water-based take about 2 hours each coat. This is a popular option for homes, and even more so stores and restaurants as they need to maintain their foot traffic.
If you are in a particular rush to finish your hardwood floors, water based may be the better option. The best thing to do is to have a discussion with your contractor and listen to their recommendations.
So, How Long Does It Take?
While each project can differ significantly regarding dry times, it is safe to say that your project is going to take at least a week. This doesn‚Äôt mean that a home will be completely disturbed for the entire week. However, between sanding and drying times, the length of your project depends on the size of your floor‚Äôs area. Larger floors take more time than those taking up less surface area. When talking to a contractor, be sure to discuss your concerns with your timeline, but remember that hardwood floor refinishing is a relatively quick home improvement project completed with little interruption to your home.",hudsonhardwood
101,https://hudsonhardwood.com/blog/should-you-refinish-your-own-floor/,"Hardwood floors just have a way of adding an elegant touch of nature to a space ‚Äì everybody loves the look. Whether they‚Äôre for a kitchen, living room, or bedroom, hardwood floors have a way of elevating the area. However, if you have original flooring in an older home, it is likely that your floors are scratched, scuffed, and dinged ‚Äì not exactly the look of a sophisticated floor.
Even if your house has floors that have been under the protection of carpeting for years, there is still a pretty high chance that they need some work! After years of wear and tear, refinishing a floor is usually a necessary option. While refinishing can be perceived as an expensive fix, it is a very involved process that required a great deal of skill and technique.
Refinishing a hardwood floor, in theory, is a simple process. You buy the supplies, sand the floor, apply the stain, and let it dry ‚Äì if only it were that easy. It is essential to get the proper supplies for sanding the floor, including a drum sander and a belt sander. If you are going to try and tackle this project on your own, you can purchase these tools from most home improvement stores. Be warned, sanding the floor will create tiny dust particles that fly up into the air and get on everything. Anyone refinishing a floor needs to wear a mask and use drop cloths to protect furniture.
The first thing you need to do if you are refinishing your floor is learning how to properly use the sander. The key to getting even and accurate sand is to learn how to get the sander to function smoothly. While the sanders are relatively easy to learn how to use, they are incredibly loud. The most critical thing to remember is that you can‚Äôt keep the sander in one spot for too long; otherwise, you run the risk of burning or denting the floor.
After removing the old finish, it is time to apply the stain and the fresh finish. This is similar to painting your nails ‚Äì first, you take off the old polish, then apply your basecoat, followed by the color, and finally the topcoat. Much like your nails, if you prefer the natural look of the floor, you can skip the stain. The finish is essential to protecting the floor.
After you‚Äôve finished everything else and it is time to apply the finish, you ultimately have two choices. You can get an oil-based finished or a water-based finish. Oils are available in satin, gloss, or semi-gloss finishes. They bring a natural glow to the floor without giving off too much shine. Water-based finishes dry more quickly, dry clearer, and are more resistant to yellowing.
Whichever you choose, it is essential to let each coat dry before applying the next. You can follow the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions or use an instructional video. If you‚Äôd rather not worry about learning the techniques, your best option may be to hire a professional.",hudsonhardwood

Solid hardwood floor, much like the name suggests, is made of solid wood from top to bottom. It is usually made from a hardwood source like maple, walnut, or oak. While solid hardwood floors are not for everyone, there are many advantages to choosing a hardwood floor.
#1 They Contribute To Better Air Quality
Believe it or not, wood floors have an added benefit of improving the quality of the air within your home. Those who suffer from allergies, such as pollen, pet dander, and other irritants will be happy to know that solid hardwood floors don‚Äôt absorb dust and other pollutants like a carpet would. If you have trouble with allergies or are just finding that the air quality within your home isn‚Äôt optimal, it may be time to make the switch.
#2 Very Easy Maintenance
Many people are under the impression that hardwood floors are difficult to maintain, but this isn‚Äôt really the case. Caring for a solid hardwood floor in order to maintain its integrity and beauty is quite simple. All you need to do is sweep the floor to remove any dust or particles that may be laying on the surface. If you spill water or anything else on the surface, simply wipe it up with a cloth ‚Äì no stain remover or blotting require here!
#3 Grow The Value Of Your Home
Solid hardwood floors receive a higher return on investment. Because they are associated with elegance, higher quality, and lasting longer than other types of flooring, they usually help a house sell fast and for more money. Hardwood floors are a feature that many potential home buyers are willing to pay more for, and this is why many homeowners choose to replace their current floors with hardwood.
#4 There Are Many Different Options
Making the choice to switch to solid hardwood floors is always an exciting process because there are so many different types of wood to choose from, and each one has their own style and spice that they can add to the room. Not only can you decide between many different shapes and types of wood, but there is always an option to choose unique plank sizes ‚Äì a very effective way to add a substantial amount of character to any room or entire house. Common wood types including oak, walnut, cherry, pine, mahogany, and many others.
#5 They Are Easily Fixed

simply isn‚Äôt true. Restoring or repairing hardwood is very straightforward process. All that has to be done is replace any areas that show damage and apply a layer of fresh finish and you‚Äôre good to go!",hudsonhardwood
103,https://hudsonhardwood.com/blog/the-benefits-of-oil-based-polyurethanes-on-hardwood-floors/,"Oil based polyurethanes are the tried and true option for hardwood floors. They have a consistent track record of durability, giving clarity and richness to the wood floors, while being more cost-efficient as well. They are great options for residential and commercial floors. Let‚Äôs take a look at some of the benefits, and what makes oil based polyurethanes stand out as the clear choice for so many people.
Oil based polyurethane gives the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù look to the hardwood floors.
A classic looking wood floor never goes out of style. For the majority of hardwoods, oil based polyurethanes will give a nice ‚Äúshine‚Äù to the wood, giving it the timeless look. The oil based also gets an amber hue to it the longer it cures over time, giving the wood a richer look, and will also show more detail in the wood compared to a water based polyurethane.
Oil based polyurethane lasts much longer
Oil based polyurethane is a thicker polyurethane to begin with, so it requires less coats to be applied versus water based polyurethanes, and will last significantly longer also. On average, the oil based polyurethanes last roughly twice as long as water based, and the color also ages better and gets a deeper amber color, versus fading like water based can. It is also naturally stronger once fully cured, so it is much more scratch and dent resistant than water based. This makes oil based polyurethanes a great choice for restaurants and floors with high amounts of traffic.
Oil based polyurethane requires less maintenance.
Just like how oil based polyurethanes last longer than water based, they are also less maintenance due to the organic compounds making them thicker and more durable. Oil based polyurethanes have less of a chance of cracking and chipping like water based can do over time, and they do not require potential ‚Äúmaintenance coats‚Äù like water based may require every two years or so. So even though the initial application time can be longer than water based, the long term payoff is more than worth it.
Oil based polyurethane is significantly cheaper.
In addition to lasting much longer than water based, oil based polyurethanes are also much cheaper. While the oil based is cheaper right off the bat, they also require around only three coats due to being a thicker base with a lot of organic compounds, versus water based which requires four to 6 coats. Oil Based Polyurethanes last twice as long as well, also saving money in the long run.
Oil based polyurethanes will always be the look we think of when ‚Äúwood floors‚Äù pop into our head, so they are here to stay for years to come. Even though the ‚Äúflat‚Äù look is popular right now, the shine and detail that oil based polyurethanes provide are still the most popular in the world. There will always be people who prefer the classic look, shine and durability of an oil based polyurethane, and there is no questioning why.",hudsonhardwood
104,https://hudsonhardwood.com/blog/the-benefits-of-water-based-polyurethanes-on-hardwood-floors/,"Water based polyurethanes have become a more popular option for hardwood floors in recent years, and for good reason. Not only are they more on trend, but they have increased dramatically in quality and benefits. There are now more reasons than ever to use a water based polyurethane, for residential and commercial uses. Let‚Äôs take a look at some of the benefits, and what makes water based polyurethanes stand out as the clear choice for so many people.
Water based polyurethane gives the ‚Äútrendy‚Äù raw look to the hardwood floors.
The flat and whitewashed looks are especially popular right now. Oil based polyurethanes are not recommended for these types of woods, as they will leave a yellow tint over time as the polyurethane cures, whereas the water based polyurethane gives a nice clear color to the wood without any shine, and the color won‚Äôt fade to a yellow tint over time, as long as you are using a quality polyurethane. It is also nice to know that you can make your floors more ‚Äútrendy‚Äù by just applying a different polyurethane, instead of having to replace the entire floors.
Water based polyurethane dries much faster.
On average, water based polyurethanes dry in about only 2 hours, which allows you to apply more coats in a single day. If you start your day early enough, you could apply the recommended four coats of polyurethane and be done in the same day. This is especially beneficial for restaurants or businesses with wood floors, as it will cut down on the time they have to be closed to redo the floors. Oil based polyurethanes can take anywhere from 3-5 hours per coat, and 12 hours after the last coat. So if time is an issue, water based polyurethanes are the way to go for you.
Water based polyurethane doesn‚Äôt smell as much.
If you have ever used an oil based polyurethane, you will know that the smell can almost be too much to handle. This is due largely to potentially toxic chemicals that are a part of the ingredients. Water based polyurethanes tend to have a much more mild smell, if any at all, due to not having as many volatile ingredients.
Water based polyurethane is safer.
Oil based polyurethanes are made with toxic chemicals that are also flammable. There have been records of short-term and long-term health problems as a result of exposure to the strong smells. Water based polyurethanes typically have little to no chemicals that are considered hazardous to your health.
Water based polyurethanes definitely have earned their place on hardwood floors in recent years. With their continuing increase in quality, and benefits listed above, they may soon become the more popular option for hardwood floors. There will always be people who prefer the classic look, shine and durability of an oil based polyurethane, but there is no denying that the water based is a strong contender and is here to stay.",hudsonhardwood
105,https://hudsonhardwood.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-water-based-finish-for-hardwood-floors/,"When refinishing hardwood floors, there‚Äôs a lot of work involved. But some of the work is researching to find out what type of hardwood floor finish will work best. When you do your research, the most important thing to consider is what type of finish will be best for your specific flooring.
Pros of Water-Based Finish for Hardwood Floors
Clear finish
Water-based polyurethane provides a completely clear finish. This means that there is no amber tint that oil-based polyurethane finishes provide. Additionally, it won‚Äôt yellow over time, so if you want to make sure your hardwood floors‚Äô color look is preserved, then a water-based finish will work do this best.
Low odor
Because of how water-based finishes are made, the odor is much less potent than if you were to use an oil-based polyurethane. Keep in mind that there is still an odor. It‚Äôs simply not as strong. If people who are sensitive to strong odors will be nearby when you‚Äôre refinishing hardwood floors, water-based is a better choice.
Dries fast
Water-based hardwood floor finishes usually dry in about two hours. This means your contractor can usually get at least two coats applied on the same day. Since it dries and cures faster than oil based, it is an excellent option for those under tight time constraints.
Environmentally friendly
Because it has a lower amount of VOCs (volatile organic compounds) than oil-based polyurethane, water-based finishes are much more environmentally friendly. As people become more concerned with the environmental impact of their choices, this can be an essential factor to consider.
Cons of Water-Based Finish for Hardwood Floors
Cost
Water-based hardwood floor finishes tend to be quite a bit more expensive than oil-based options. Additionally, you usually need an extra coat of water-based finish than you would with an oil-based finish, to handle heavier traffic.
Maintenance and Durability
Since it doesn‚Äôt last quite as long, new coats of water-based finish need to be applied more frequently than oil based. Doing this will bring back the fresh look and durability we typically look for in a hardwood floor.
Water-based polyurethane can be a great choice, depending on what your needs are. Make sure you weigh the pros and cons concerning your project to make sure it‚Äôs the right fit.",hudsonhardwood

There is no hardwood floor refinishing that is better than the other, but if you choose one that does not match what you are looking for, then you may be disappointed. Keep reading to learn more about what each floor has to offer and which may be the best one for you when you plan on refinishing your hardwood floors.
Refinishing Hardwood Floors With Water-Based Polyurethane
While both water-based and oil-based floors offer a good amount of protection, the main difference is the appearance of each. Water-based polyurethane may look milky in the container but will go on clear and won‚Äôt yellow over time. If you are looking for a neutral color and tone, this may be the best option as oil-based finishes tend to give a warmer, more yellow tint.
Regarding the durability of water-based finishes, they are mostly in line with oil-based polyurethane. They resist scuffing, UV exposure, water, corrosion, and mar. If you are short on time, or do not wish to wait any longer than you have to when refinishing hardwood floors, then water-based is the best option as it takes less than half of the time to dry in relation to oil-based finishes. In addition to a shorter dry time, water-based finishes contain little to no hazardous ingredients.
Refinishing Hardwood Floors With Oil-Based Polyurethane
Oil-based finishes offer a warmer or amber hue when applied to a hardwood floor refinishing project. Keep in mind this yellow color will intensify over time, but oil-based polyurethanes will give your wood a softer feel. In terms of durability, when refinishing hardwood floors, you can expect both water- and oil-based finishes to provide the same level of protection. While oil-based finishes take more time to dry ‚Äì at least a couple of days. However, it will require less maintenance over time.
If you are worried about dry times or toxic solvents, oil-based polyurethane may not be the best choice as it does contain quite a bit of exposure to highly flammable and toxic elements. These solvents allow the finish to cure into a protective film, which allows the polyurethane to better protect the wood underneath. With oil-based polyurethane, you may get a bit more bang for your buck as you will need fewer coats to achieve the same desired results as you would with multiple coats of a water-based finish.
Final Thoughts
Both finishes have their fair share of both advantages and disadvantages. What matters most is finding something that fits your needs the best. Water-based finishes are best for those who prefer a wood with a cooler or neutral finish, short wait and dry times, and doesn‚Äôt contain any hazardous or flammable solvents during application. Oil-based polyurethanes offer a warmer, amber color with a more protective finish and less maintenance after refinishing.",hudsonhardwood

Areas not being worked on should be sealed off from the work area with tape and plastic. This protects the rest of your property and your health during the refinishing process.
Step 3: Covering Vents
Vents should be covered with plastic and tape to protect your HVAC system from dust and debris.
Step 4: Bringing in Equipment
Sanding equipment and dust containment equipment are brought in to prepare for the refinishing process.
Preparing the room adequately for your flooring project with your contractor ensures that the refinishing process goes smoothly and that your property is protected from any damage.
Now, Hudson Hardwood is ready to get started on the sanding of your flooring.
Sanding your floor 3-4 times
Sanding is the first step in the refinishing process. It involves removing the existing finish and exposing the bare wood. There are several steps to sanding hardwood floors.
Sanding hardwood flooring is done using our specialized equipment that removes the top layer of the wood, including any scratches or dents. When sanding, we use several different levels of grit, depending on the condition of your floors.
This involves sanding a hardwood floor approximately three to four times thoroughly. This ensures a smooth surface that is ready for the next step: applying your chosen stain, dye, or finish.
During the sanding process, the floor is visually inspected by a trained hardwood specialist to ensure that all of the scratches have been removed. Final sanding uses a specialty hardwood floor sander with LED lights to highlight any remaining imperfections and remove them. This specific hardwood sander was created to create smooth, flat, even floors.
Applying stain, dye, or finish with a customized blend of colors
After sanding, the next step for finishing wooden floors is staining your hardwood flooring.
Staining
Staining (applying dye) helps to add color and depth to your wood. You can choose from various stain colors, depending on your preference. This will be planned out beforehand. Hudson Hardwood can customize colors with unique blends to match other areas of hardwood or an image you have of what you‚Äôd like in your home.
Staining is typically done using a brush, roller, or sprayer, and it‚Äôs essential to apply it evenly to achieve a consistent finish.
Finishing
Hardwood floor finishing is our final step in the refinishing process. It involves applying a protective coating to the wood to enhance its durability and protect it from future wear and tear.
You can choose from various finishes, including oil-based, water-based, and polyurethane finishes. Finishing is typically done using a brush, roller, or sprayer, and it‚Äôs essential to apply it evenly to achieve a consistent finish. We know the easiest way to refinish hardwood floors.
How long does it take to refinish hardwood floors, completely?
How long to refinish hardwood floors depends on several factors, but typically it takes about 2-3 days.

Flooring companies are a great resource to have in hand, and for this, you should pick the best. There are a couple of things to look out for to be sure you have the best choice. This will ensure the hardwood floor restoration services you get are the best. Here, we‚Äôll discuss the signs you should look out for in a flooring company.
They Go The Extra Mile
The best flooring companies are always willing to go the extra mile for their clients. This might be about offering different services like hardwood floor refinishing and hardwood floor installation, or even just being available when you need them. They should be willing to answer any questions and help you out with whatever you need.
They‚Äôre Knowledgeable
One of the most important things to look for in a flooring company is knowledge. They should know what they‚Äôre talking about, from types of materials to installation processes and everything in between. If they don‚Äôt have the answers to your questions, it‚Äôs not likely that they‚Äôll be able to provide you with the service you need.
They‚Äôre Affordable
You must find a flooring company that is both knowledgeable and affordable. You don‚Äôt want to break the bank when getting your floors done, but you also want to ensure that you‚Äôre getting quality work. There are a lot of companies out there that offer affordable services without compromising on quality ‚Äì Hudson Hardwood is one of them.
They Offer Livable Conditions During Renovations
Hardwood floor restoration services can be disruptive, especially when they involve your flooring. A good flooring company will work with you to ensure the process is as smooth and painless as possible. This might mean working around your schedule or even taking care of the clean-up once the job is done.
They Are Environmentally Responsible
The best flooring companies are also environmentally responsible. They use materials that are sustainable and non-toxic, and they take measures to recycle and reduce waste. If you‚Äôre looking for a company that cares about the environment, Hudson Hardwood is a great choice.

111,https://hudsonhardwood.com/blog/which-is-better-oil-based-vs-water-based-polyurethane-floors/,"When doing hardwood floor refinishing, you might have some challenges choosing between oil and water-based polyurethane materials. Both products are suitable to refinish hardwood floors, but some differences might help you decide which product is suited for your preferred hardwood floor refinishing outcome.
Here is all the information you need to choose to decide which of our two products is better to refinish hardwood floors. It can be simple to choose, but different customers who come to us have different needs for their hardwood floor finishing. Thus it is our role to give a perfect experience.
When used to refinish hardwood floors, oil-based polyurethane gives more depth as it is shiny and looks the way we expect hardwood to look. On the other hand, water-based floors have duller colors and duller finishes.
When Wood floor finishing is done using oil-based polyurethane materials lasts longer than one done using water-based materials. On the other hand, water-based polyurethane has less VOC‚Äôs which is more friendly to the environment.
If you choose to use water-based polyurethane for refinishing hardwood floors, remember that you will require four to five coats to match the durability of three coats of oil-based polyurethane. This is because water-based polyurethane is thinner.
We have also noted that most customers who call us for refinishing hardwood floors call again after five to six years in cases of water-based polyurethane and around ten years for oil-based polyurethane. The water-based wood floor refinishing looks terrible; actually, they have started peeling, and the hardwood floor is turning grey.
Always bear in mind that refinishing your hardwood floor might be a bit cumbersome, especially if you live there because you need to move all your furniture and you might need to move away for some days. Thus if you decide you are going through the hassle of refinishing your hardwood floor, do it right for more durability.
Refinishing your hardwood floors using water-based polyurethane will be more expensive compared to oil-based polyurethane. On top of that cost, remember you will be required to redo it again sooner.
Water-based is also an excellent option for others for some circumstances. Wood floor finishing done using water-based polyurethane dries faster. It can be done in two days, and you can walk on the same night. This advantage is ideal, especially for commercial businesses such as hotels, restaurants, and stores.
Furthermore, water-based polyurethane doesn‚Äôt smell bad compared to oil-based polyurethane that your neighbors won‚Äôt be uncomfortable with water-based polyurethane. Water-based polyurethane also has less volatile organic compounds; thus, it is more environmentally friendly. Oil-based polyurethane has more volatile organic compounds; therefore, it is likely to interfere with the ecosystem.
However, from another perspective, hardwood floor finishing done using water-based polyurethane doesn‚Äôt last long. Thus the need to redo them more often means they will still emit more volatile organic compounds, thus canceling their benefit.
I hope you won‚Äôt be stuck again when choosing which polyurethane is better for your circumstances; with the above info, I bet you will make a perfect decision.",hudsonhardwood

Fun Facts About Philadelphia, PA
Philadelphia is the largest city in Pennsylvania and the 6th largest city in the United States with a population of nearly 1.6 million. The city acts as the economic and cultural center of the Delaware Valley, an area loosely defined by the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers.
Originally inhabited by Lenape Indians, then later settled and fought over by the Dutch and the Swedes, Philadelphia eventually came into the hands of William Penn. In 1682 it was charted to him by the king to pay a debt. Penn felt the right thing to do was to pay the Lenape Indians for their land. This act went a long way in keeping peace with them and contributing to the growth of the city.
Philadelphia was one of the first 13 colonies and is home to Independence Hall where both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution were written. It played an important role during the Revolutionary War and is home to the first congressional congress, the Liberty Bell, and the Battle of Germantown.
A prominent citizen, Ben Franklin, helped develop many new programs in the city which made Philadelphia a better place to live. This included a fire company, library, and hospital. Philadelphia was also home to the first medical school, stock exchange, zoo, and business school.
In 1776 the Declaration of Independence was signed in Philadelphia and the city continued to grow as a cultural hub with the creation of scholarly institutions like the Academy of Natural Sciences, Franklin Institute, and the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture.
Philadelphia‚Äôs central location close to New York, Washington D.C, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and other states, made it an easily accessible place by land, sea, and river. The city‚Äôs population quickly grew with an influx of German and Irish immigrants.
During the 19th century, railroads made Philadelphia a desirable location for many industries, textiles being the most prominent. Major corporations flocked to Philadelphia where the Pennsylvania Railroad provided easy access to transportation.
Between approximately 1940 ‚Äì 1980 there was a mass exodus from the city. Racial unrest and riots led people to escape to the suburbs and businesses moved elsewhere. It was not until 2007 that the city saw its population finally begin to increase to the almost 1.6 million it is today. The rebuilding of historic areas like Center City, Old City, University City has been bringing residents back.
Today, Philadelphia is home to many prestigious universities and colleges ‚Äì Temple University and Drexel University being among them. Residents enjoy a wide variety of cultural and outdoor destinations including Fairmount Park, The Philadelphia Museum of Art, Independence National Historical Park, Reading Terminal Market, Elfreth‚Äôs Alley, and many more.
Philadelphia is home to major sports teams and arenas including Citizen‚Äôs Bank Park, Lincoln Financial Field, and the Wells Fargo Center. The area‚Äôs transportation infrastructure includes SEPTA Regional Rail and Philadelphia International Airport.",hudsonhardwood

Cleaning and re-coating are also sometimes called a ‚Äúbuff and coat‚Äù. It removes short-term finishes that cloud and haze wood floors. Products like mop & glow, and murphy oil soap, cause clouding and hazing that can only be removed by professionally cleaning the hardwood, and re-coating it.
While not removing scratches in the wood, or changing color, cleaning and re-coating is a cost-effective way to refresh your hardwood floors without the hassle, expense, and time, of a full refinishing. During the cleaning our expert craftsmen perform a light abrading of the top layer of your finish without touching the actual wood. This repairs fading and fine scratches in the surface of the finish only. It also allows you to improve your current finish with a higher quality and more durable one, that lasts longer and better protects your floors.
Cleaning and re-coating should be performed every 2-3 years to extend the life of your hardwood floor.
