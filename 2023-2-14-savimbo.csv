Savimbo is a company created by, and for, indigenous and local smallfarmers in the Colombian Amazon.
The project began when five medicine doctors, and a community organization of smallfarmer conservationists, asked a strange tech company of delinquent savants to help them stop the logging on their lands.
We found a way.

Global Ignite Vision & Action
Thought leadership refined
Our aim is to employ 1 billion smallfarmers within 10 years to clean the world’s air.
How it works
Effective altruism and fair-trade economics with no middlemen. We pay subsistence farmers in tropical forests direct monthly micropayments to sequester carbon. If they need help to participate, our partnering nonprofit subsidizes their entry to this international market. Then we certify their credits, sell them on international exchanges and give them 20% of any profits. Effective, inexpensive, and globally-beneficial carbon storage.
How we do it
Emerging technologies. We aren’t afraid of hard science and we know how to work in the developing world. We teach our farmers how to track their own offsets using trustless methodologies that work off-grid. We employ drone photogrammetry, satellite monitoring, machine learning, GPS, biochar pyrolysis, and blockchain to track offsets from creation, certification, and sale.

How to show respect as an ecotourist or project liaison among Aboriginal peoples in rural or remote areas
Many international business failures have been ascribed to a lack of cultural competence. Many carbon credit projects in the Amazon have failed for this very reason - yet Savimbo is thriving. Here’s why.
Have you ever heard of everyday things that would be considered rude in other countries?
For example, it is considered rude to tip on a bill in Japan and South Korea. A thumbs-up means something very different (it's bad) in the Middle East, Latin America, and other countries. Finishing your plate is considered rude in countries like China, the Philippines, and Russia.
Maybe you can think of more, there are endless examples, but the point is that things we do as a matter of course in our daily lives can be quite offensive to others.
Knowing how to behave in other cultures is a skill in itself, and it's called cultural competency.
Cultural competency isn’t just something for tourists, it is a vital skill in the workplace and beyond. In our increasingly globalized world, we can interact with diverse peoples within the borders of our native countries and online. This means that it has never been easier or more accessible to practice our cultural competency (or to offend people).
What is cultural competency?
Even if you’ve never heard of cultural competency, there is a part of you that understands it implicitly. No one likes the idea of going to another country and being that stereotypical tourist (we all know who they are). As the old saying goes, ‘when in Rome…’ don't be a jackass.
But the concept of cultural competence is quite distinct from simply not being rude or standing out, it even transcends being respectful. The simplest definition of cultural competency is one’s ability to meaningfully interact with people from cultural backgrounds different from their own. It requires you to act like more than just a guest; you need to foster a coexistent relationship in a way that honors everyone’s differences.
The further we get from our own cultures, the less natural this ability becomes, and the more conscious effort is required to honor the culture of the place you are in. Developing cultural competence is a dynamic and complex process that requires continuous expansion of cultural knowledge. It evolves over time, beginning with an understanding of your own culture, continuing through interactions with people from other cultures, and extends through your whole life.
Earlier we spoke about how tipping, hand gestures, and table manners can all be slightly different, but these were all examples of relatively small discrepancies between industrial-world countries.
By contrast, the cultural difference between many indigenous communities and the industrialized world can seem like night and day. Many indigenous peoples have a rich culture and history that has developed for millennia far from western ideals.
Honoring culture, respecting people, and fostering trust
In industrial countries, many people aspire to earn lots of money, have a comfortable office job, and own a big house. Perhaps you hope to be an executive or otherwise influential person that has the authority to set thousands of people to work on your new and exciting ideas. There is nothing wrong with these aspirations, but it colors and shapes our interactions, and not everyone wants the same things.
By contrast, rural and remote indigenous communities are motivated by different metrics. Ideals often include group success, lifelong learning, experience, and community. In many groups, money, property, and land are resources that are not individually owned but instead shared through the community for its benefit.
Indigenous values create successful interdependent communal living groups. Unlike our modern interconnected world, these groups are largely autonomous and can thrive in relative isolation if needs be. While these communities will often have a leader that represents the group - they do not have ultimate authority over it. Indeed, the idea of a CEO or president - a single person who has ultimate authority over all is alien.
This last point is especially important when trying to engage in business with indigenous peoples. Western companies and other industrialized corporations expect to engage with a single person who has the authority to sign on behalf of the community. When dealing with the leaders of communities they assume their power is absolute, and that land purchases agreed by individuals represent the rest of the group.
There have been many examples where foreign organizations believe they have purchased the land owned by a community because a leader agreed and took payment. Representatives of those organizations then begin to survey the land they ‘own’ only to discover the rest of the community did not agree. The former community leader has left with the money, the community is damaged, land ownership is unclear and an often messy and protracted legal battle will ensue. Not only is this a loss for both the indigenous communities and foreign companies alike, but it also does massive damage to trust.
Successfully navigating a meaningful business relationship with an indigenous community is nuanced and requires honoring culture, respecting people, and fostering trust.
This topic could be a whole book on its own, but for this post, let's stick to the basics: how to act when visiting an indigenous community as a guest, ecotourist, or business liaison.
Cultural competency for ecotourists - a beginners guide
Even as an ecotourist it is vital to be culturally competent. Not being culturally competent while traveling to indigenous lands is the same as using those lands as a means to your own ends. Even if that goal is appreciation or conservation, achieving that goal without being culturally competent can be uncomfortably close to exploitation.
As our local partners in the Colombian Amazon explained:
The good news is that being a culturally competent guest is not difficult, but it does require a paradigm shift in how you view the community around you.
Indigenous people have had many poor experiences with outsiders and many might seem guarded at first. Your behavior will be closely watched to see if you will mesh well with the community. Here are a few general starting points for cultural competency around indigenous peoples. But remember, cultural generalities never apply to an individual, and every culture changes over time. People will teach you themselves how to act — if you listen.
Gifts: It is often customary to present gifts to the elders when you enter an indigenous community. These gifts are not strictly for the elders and will likely be shared with the community. You can show awareness of this by getting something useful for everyone, or for trade, like hammocks, solar head-lamps, high-quality hand tools, etc.
Giving together: Following this theme, you should present any gifts together to the group you arrived with. The presents are from one community to another so that both may thrive together. While industrialized people often value individualism, acting alone in this setting can make us seem fractured — and give the impression that we do not value community.
Sharing: Wherever possible, bring food to share, and share it. Sharing food is a universal human bonding activity. Within an indigenous community, it's wise to watch how food is consumed and apportioned, who eats first (this is often based on age or gender), and how it is shared then follow along.
Nonverbal communication: Indigenous communities value non-verbal communication, it is very useful for hunting and observing wildlife. This means your actions and body language will speak strongly of your values and intentions to the community. If you go out of your way to show alertness, match your words to your nonverbal signals, and help with communal tasks, they will see you as someone experienced with communal living. Everyone can relax more and you will be rewarded with additional interaction and teachings. It can be helpful to leave longer pauses after speaking as well, as often these communities leave a silence in between one person and the other’s statements.
Gender roles: Women in indigenous communities are not always front and center, but they are still respected. If you are a woman, you will probably interface with the men at first. But do take extra time to show respect for the women of the community. Slowly you will build a relationship and they will approach you on their own to share their knowledge and stories with you. If you are a man, openly approaching the women of the indigenous community may be very inappropriate. Instead, acknowledge the women when you see them, with a respectful nod, and be open to communication if you are approached.
Of course, this list is not exhaustive but hopefully it begins the paint a picture of some of the ways paradigms and values that underpin indigenous cultures can change the way people act. And the basic ways you can subtly honor them when you are a guest.
To do successful business or trade, however, you need a much deeper understanding that permeates not just one traveler but your entire company culture.
Savimbo and fair-trade cultural competency
We’re still learning how to work with the indigenous groups we serve — but ongoing learning is the point. After all, The Savimbo Project was initiated with, and for, indigenous communities to provide a viable economy for reforestation and preservation.
Rural and indigenous communities are very good at preserving and reforesting the rainforest, it has been their home for millennia, they simply ask for fair trade for their efforts. In return, they are willing to slow climate change, preserve endangered species, and generate premium carbon credits for the global organizations that need them. This is a win-win.
Because of the enormous benefits of partnering with indigenous communities and corporations alike, our company culture has both western and indigenous values deeply embedded in it. We prioritize cultural competency from the boardroom to the Amazon basin — and especially between them!
Attempting to build a company culture with such cultural breadth isn't simple or easy but that is part of what sets Savimbo apart. The alternative would mean engaging with indigenous communities without holding their values front-and-center and a loss of the urban-rural exchange that makes carbon sequestration easy to scale and maintain.
Disregarding the cultural significance of ecologically vital land is no small part of what led our planet to the massive deforestation issue we see today. If you come to someone’s home to extract value from it and give them little in return - that is most definitely exploitation. It is the very reason so many indigenous cultures are so wary of outsiders and it is the reason that so many carbon credit projects in the Amazon have failed.
One of our core values is trust. We believe that trust is built over time with transparent actions, and careful adherence to small, measurable commitments.
By paying attention to our trustworthiness, instead of demanding trust, we’ve been able to build good relationships in areas where people have struggled to work together.
Being human is hard — but making friends is universal. Taking the time to understand a new friend can open up doors in our own reality, and our own assumptions about the world, and open up new avenues for success.
You’re always welcome to be our friend too :)"

An open letter to Verra
Hi Verra,
I'm an MD-technologist, I've been working in high-tech for over ten years. Eventually, I created a consulting company for high-IQ individuals to solve hard scientific and social problems using emerging solutions. We called it Delinquent Savants.
I started a project for fair-trade carbon credits. But I didn't set out to work in the carbon market — or to use blockchain. I set out to solve a problem.
Three medicine doctors approached me who live in the Colombian Amazon. They heard our agency solved unsolvable problems. They asked me to switch their remote economy from deforestation to conservation. I didn't know how, but I set out to learn.
I discovered, after looking at similar Verra projects in the region, that we could pay local smallfarmers three times more for carbon sequestration than they made selling cows for the same hectarage. The problem is, that the Verra certification pipeline is so massive, and rigorous, and involved they had no hope of doing the certifying. But they didn't want outside validators on their land. So we began to train them. Silviculture, land papers, documentation of conservation, cultivation, and planting. But as you know — that's the easy part.
No one was willing to do business with them at first. The digital divide was too large, and everyone lacked the cultural competency. We needed trustless protocols, so we taught them drone photogrammetry, GPS, an on-the-ground ML that differentiates between selectively-logged and native jungle, and how to document animal species without disturbing them. And we started doing the hard paperwork required for certifying a credit.
They said we were the first environmentalists who had ever come to their jungle — and there were many — that had ever given them even $1 for planting a tree.
So they taught us about the intricate lifecycles of hundreds of trees. Information I can't find in any silviculture or ecology database. They wanted their traditional knowledge documented in photographs and international English. And they went to their people, and one by one they came to us with small plots and big dreams. They got bank accounts and land papers. They sent me photographs of jaguar tracks and their forests. They changed, they wanted to change. And the Government of Colombia did too. They assigned me a silviculture expert, and a translator free of charge, and asked for an industrial biochar machine for the city center.
Other people heard what I am doing, in Thailand, Bolivia, Brazil, Uganda, the Congo, and Nepal. It spread like wildfire through the indigenous groups and the people who help them. They heard I don't pay any middlemen, only the farmers directly. And the clients came. An aluminum company, aerospace startups, small businesses in the US who want to go green, Hollywood film studios, and the sheik of a middle-eastern nation.
The thing is Verra, we can't do it without you. We need your stamp of approval and your expertise so our clients can trust us, use us, and we can scale. And the problem is, we also can't do it without blockchain. Our clients want to know where their carbon sequestration came from. They want to know that a farmer changed his life with their support and they are actually moving the dial. They don't want to buy a carbon future of unknown provenance on the international exchange and learn John Oliver doesn't like it. They want origin stories.
I want something more complex. I want my farmers to receive some of the revenue that comes from their products. I see my farmers planting trees by hand, and I see their love for the forests. Then I see international markets and the brokers making 80-90% of the profits of carbon credits from a cushy office building in the center of New York. I see what that money can do to restore the forests in the Amazon, to stop 300-year-old trees from being logged. I want my farmers to have a share in their credit when it sells, and I want to sell it directly to companies that have to prove emissions reductions.
We are not a nonprofit, we are a farming collective and this international crop is worth something. I need blockchain for two things. I need it to help me with transactions. Thousands of farmers are needed to reduce the emissions of one large corporation. I need to track shared ownership of credits through very complex interactions, and across a long period of time. One carbon credit takes years to transit the certification pipeline.
My clients will pay a deposit on the credit before it's certified, and buy it when the paperwork is finished, but we don't want to release it from our pipeline until it's officially retired in the Verra database. Because until then, it still has value — and I want my farmers to have a share in that value because they did the work.
This can be done with regular software, and if Verra rules against Web3 — we will do it with regular software. But it's much easier to buy, sell, and track commodities like this with blockchain. We have no interest in trading offsets and inflating the prices, in some hyped-up Web3 pump-and-dump. We are willing to do the critical and labor-intensive tasks of certification. And we ask Verra to examine blockchain technology, not for what it has done, but for what it could do.
We hope you can see the economic potential in the technology to enable shared profits for subsistence farmers in tropical forests, who have the most potential to truly move the dial for our planet. We need their effort and ingenuity, and ownership of the problem.
I'm determined to work with Verra, and I can take or leave blockchain for our projects if it's an either/or. But it would help me immensely. Please work with me on this one.

As extreme weather events continue to get more frequent and carbon reduction promises loom ever closer. Companies and nations are growing increasingly nervous about the risks that lie ahead.
For nations, the risk is clear: increasing extreme weather events lead to deaths, destruction, and loss of income. Growing public outcry coupled with looming carbon emission reductions is placing increasing pressure on politicians to take immediate action. But there is really only one thing they can immediately do: a carbon tax.
Taxing carbon-emitting companies for the perceived damage they are doing to the environment will help politicians to be seen to be punishing those responsible while generating funds for damages and future efforts. Rightly or wrongly, a carbon tax will pass the burden of the cost of climate change from nations to CEOs, and many high carbon footprint (carbon-emitting) companies are starting to realize they must offset this very real risk.
Climate change is a global game and companies can be charged by any country for the carbon they emit anywhere in the world. You only need one country to charge a carbon tax to severely impact the profitability of many international companies. Many companies are worried they may have to pay for their carbon footprint many times over.
What are carbon credits?
A carbon credit is proof that a certain amount of carbon dioxide (or equivalent greenhouse gas) has been removed from the atmosphere. Typically, a carbon credit is sold by the ton and allows a carbon-emitting organization to offset its carbon footprint to some extent (hence the name carbon credit).
For example, a commercial airline might emit 20 million tons of CO2 into the air in a given year. This airline might look to offset this amount by purchasing 20 million tons worth of carbon credits, which would (theoretically) make the airline’s carbon-footprint zero (carbon neutral) and so it will not be taxed.
The very significant risk that a carbon tax represents is causing many large corporations to proactively purchase carbon credits in large quantities to decrease financial risk. In 2021, McKinsey forecasted a 15x growth in the cost of carbon credits by 2030, and a 100x growth by 2050. Such a sharp increase in price demonstrates that supply is woefully trailing demand. So how is a carbon credit made?
Currently (and by a big margin) the simplest way to remove carbon from the atmosphere is to grow trees, billions of trees. We all learned in school that trees take sunlight and carbon (CO2) from the air and turn it into sugar and oxygen. Trees ultimately use these sugars to grow wood, converting CO2 into a solid form.
About 1/3 of the mass of a tree is carbon, all of which is extracted from the air. For example, General Sherman (the biggest tree in the world) weighs about 1,900 tons. This means General Sherman contains about 600 tons of carbon and as long as General Sharman is standing and healthy, this carbon will remain locked up in the tree.
And this is the catch - the tree only holds carbon while it stands, once cut down, rotting, or consumed by wildfires the CO2 is released back. This means it is not enough to grow trees. You need to guarantee the tree stays standing and healthy or the carbon credit is worthless because no carbon is locked up.
Companies will need to prove their carbon credits actually relate to standing trees to offset their carbon footprint. This typically means some sort of certification or standard and someone to enforce it. Not all standards are equal, some are low quality and others are premium. It all depends on where you grow the trees, what type of tree, how long they live, if it helps the native environment, etc.
There are many factors to consider and academics are still debating the details, but needless to say, companies pay a premium for carbon credits that are more reliable, better at reducing risk, and come with other ESG perks like improving communities, restoring wildlife, preserving biodiversity, etc.
What is a fair trade carbon credit?
Savimbo offers the most premium carbon credit imaginable: fair-trade carbon credits.
One of the best places to grow (or preserve) trees is the Amazon rainforest. Often called the world's lungs, the Amazon rainforest absorbs a staggering 25% (600 million tons) of CO2 every year — producing oxygen for us to breathe and slowing climate change. Unfortunately, carbon is not the only natural resource present in the rainforest and many seek to exploit its natural wealth for lumber, cattle, and minerals - which is driving an unprecedented rate of deforestation here.
A UN Report found about 1/3 of the Amazon rainforest is owned by indigenous groups, and almost half of the undamaged rainforest is owned by them. Indigenous peoples have lived in the rainforest for generations, they understand better than anyone how to co-exist with the rainforest, how it grows, how to care for it, and how to preserve it. And they are open to sharing its benefits in sustainable ways.
In the words of our indigenous partners from the Colombian Amazon:
Savimbo works with Indigenous groups who choose to harness the enormous potential of the carbon they possess. Much like other fair-trade products (coffee or chocolate for example) we work directly with communities to give them a fair-market rate on their products and create local economies based on international reforestation needs.
Our local and indigenous partners initiated the Savimbo project. Asking us to build a company that could work with them to preserve and replant the Amazon rainforest, retain biodiversity, protect wildlife, while providing a fair income source to create a lasting peace! Savimbo does all of this, while providing a product that large corporations need: reliable, audited, quantified carbon credits with substantial ESG upsides. (Yeah, we’re happy about it too!)
Savimbo’s fair-trade carbon credits are a win-win for large corporations and indigenous peoples alike. The only people who lose out with our model are the middlemen, and that's fine by us!
The middlemen, and why carbon credits must be fair-trade!
As with any market, there are middlemen and the carbon credit market is no different. Typically, a middleman exists because the sellers and buyers struggle to deal directly with each other because of differences in geographic location, language, values, scale, etc.
Like many very successful fair-trade companies, the Savimbo project works by understanding the needs of both corporations and indigenous communities. One of our core values is trust, and we earn that trust by being transparent and results-driven: from the boardroom to the rainforest, Savimbo is a direct connection between these two disparate places to the benefit of both. Our fair-trade carbon credits improve rainforest communities and corporate profits alike, to produce a cleaner, better world, preserve life, and reduce the risk for all.
Just like fair-trade coffee, Savimbo is appealing to buyers and sellers alike and will sweep the market simply because we transact fairly with all parties in it.
Savimbo, a great green deal
A carbon reckoning is coming and a carbon tax seems likely. Companies are increasingly looking to offset the risk they face from emitting CO2 with carbon credits. The carbon credit market is predicted to grow 100x by 2050 for this precise reason. Savimbo is a premium fair trade carbon credit product, it benefits indigenous groups and corporations alike - and for this reason, its fair trade carbon credits will trade far above market price.
Those who reserve credits now will help indigenous communities, reduce their carbon footprint in objectively verifiable ways, and make a profit…
There is no reason that saving the environment, and good business are an either-or. At Savimbo, we’re proving that both are possible. Join us today!"
28,https://www.savimbo.com/blog/why-good-ceos-are-buying-carbon-credits-now,"Why good CEOs are buying carbon credits now
Securing a good supply of carbon credits is savvy business, here’s why
The Paris Accord will bring ever-tightening emissions regulations in the next decade. Businesses that put off facing this challenge dramatically increase their costs and overall risk. Bloomberg now predicts the price of carbon credits could increase 3,000% by 2029 as companies who have procrastinated action scramble to offset liability and become carbon neutral.
This doesn’t have to be a scramble — it can be a real win on more fronts than just climate change. But only if corporations are realistic about future carbon emissions regulation.
Membership in the Paris Accords is going to lead to tightening regulations on corporate emissions in the next decade. Governments like the US, China, and the European Union have signed legally binding, and publicly audited, commitments, and they are going to have to offload those commitments onto the industry. They will start doing this within the next five years based on the planning-horizon timelines.
Insurance and investment are the first industry players to move on a necessary standard, then enterprise businesses, and finally regulatory bodies. Insurance brokers like Lloyds of London have been paying premium costs for climate change for many years. Now in order to secure insurance, enterprise business is assessing the risk associated with being or working with high-emissions processes. They are also asking for voluntary emissions reporting, and clearer standards to help manage that risk.
Disclosed emissions bring transparency, but also scrutiny to those who are perceived to be the worst offenders. Governments have the shortest planning horizons, but even a heavily-divided US Congress passed the most aggressive climate regulation the US has ever seen this year. Why did they do this? Keep reading, we’ll explain.
If you’re a CEO, this article is for you — your business, your employees, and your stakeholders. Any industrial CEO who is not aware of, and taking aggressive action on their looming emissions risk will pay a steep price in three ways:
Enormous business disruption as they pivot when public and private entities refuse to do business with them
Having to pay a massive price to purchase carbon credits at the last minute in large quantities at unfavorable prices
Losing business from customers, employees, and suppliers because of poor public perception of their business practices.
We don’t like to talk about problems, without offering solutions. So let's define the problem with facts, and offer a clear solution.
Why the Paris Accords is leading to government regulation
As the IPCC reports, any global temperature rise above +2 C will be catastrophic to both the planet and the economy. Climate change is measurably causing real deaths, poverty, extreme weather events, ocean-front property loss, habitat loss, and animal extinctions. These are real effects — specific, measurable, and expensive.
As a result, 186 countries signed and ratified a legally binding agreement called the Paris Accords that mandates reporting for their carbon emissions. Its members are responsible for over 90% of global emissions. They agreed to keep climate change under +2 C above pre-industrial levels and strive for +1.5 C.
Paris Accord members pledged mandatory emissions reporting to track progress toward these targets. These public reports are subject to evaluation by experts — and peer pressure from other countries. Also, developed member nations (who contributed most to climate change) are expected to provide financial assistance to developing member nations to help them with the cost of the climate crisis and build renewable infrastructure. Although, currently the amount being pledged by developed nations is falling short of goals.
These are lofty aims. Unfortunately, current metrics show that we’re not doing enough, with studies suggesting we are headed towards a catastrophic +3C temperature rise. Even if every country managed to achieve their current Paris Accord goals we are very likely to go over the +2C temperature target by 2100.
This might seem confusing at first, but it's really important to recognize the Paris Accord isn’t static. Countries are expected to revisit their emissions targets every five years, examining the global budget of carbon that must be removed from the atmosphere and taking a fair share of the burden.
The Paris Accord is a living document, the current goals represent the starting point of any climate action, a warmup before the marathon. Much of the work in getting to carbon neutral by 2050 and then limiting climate change to +2C by 2100 still remains to be done.
And it's going to be expensive.
The worst corporate offenders will pick up the bill for all emissions
Climate change affects everyone everywhere, not just those unfortunate enough to be caught in disasters, poverty, and famine. Research shows that climate change is responsible for billions of dollars of health costs in the US. A 2018 study found that in the USA alone, failing to meet the Paris agreement could cost the economy up to $6 trillion over the next decades.
There is a clear financial benefit to a nation that meets its end of the bargain. While failing to meet the Paris Accord goals could reduce global GDP by 25% by 2100, meeting or exceeding them could add $19 trillion to the global economy in the next 30 years.
As the measurable real cost of climate change grows and emissions targets get tighter significant regulations and punitive measures (fines and taxes) are going to get passed to industry. After all, developed nations are shouldering a huge cost of climate change (economic, public health, developing funds, etc.) and these costs will need to be passed to someone.
Enterprise businesses are also wary of the potential costs of working with high emitters and are looking for ways to offset that risk. Voluntary carbon reporting might become another cost of doing business. The private sector typically looks a certain distance into the future when considering what risks it should be addressing today, this is called the business cycle and it is typically 5-10 years.
However, one industry has to think much further into the future — insurers.
Professional insurers are very good futurists. To correctly price premiums on insurance insurers have to understand what could happen through the lifetime of their policy. For example, a baby born today will live past 2100 - and so you need some idea of what that world will look like to offer them life insurance.
There are many things that also last for many decades: buildings, natural resources, institutions, etc. All of these things typically require insurance to operate owing to existing regulations to limit risk to investors, employees, customers, etc.
Climate change is one of the biggest unknowns of this century and into the next. There are many types of claims that could be impacted beyond immediate losses from the weather. For example, when giving liability insurance to large oil firms you need to understand what the chances are they could be sued for emitting large amounts of CO2.
And emitters are big business. 19% of FTSE 100 companies are in natural resource and extraction sectors; and a further 11% by value are in power utilities, chemicals, construction, and industrial goods sectors. Globally, these two tiers of companies between them account for around one-third of equity and fixed income assets.
To understand these questions insurers look back into past data to extrapolate forward. This also means insurers are seeing a very real increase in claims climate change is costing them.
While insurers do not want to drive change in the economy, it is in their best interests (and governments) to achieve a reasonably smooth transition from today to the goals of tomorrow. Large institutions have worked with the G20 to produce the TCFD. The TCFD is not a policy recommendation, but a reporting standard for the industry. It is intended to provide standardization and transparency so private organizations can make better decisions about risk and exposure when dealing with each other. In the very near future, your insurer is going to ask you for it or they might refuse to insure you.
Why good CEOs are becoming carbon neutral
Climate change used to be an opinion problem, you either believed or you didn’t. But now it’s a facts problem. You either look at the facts or you don't. Good CEOs don’t waste a lot of time on opinions — but they never ignore facts and neither does the market.
The harsh reality of climate change is that it will demand a massive change in world markets that very few are prepared for. Some markets will cease to exist while entirely new ones spring into existence. There will be winners and there will be losers.
Data allows us to remove ourselves from the eternal debate between skeptics and evangelists. Valuations of companies that produce and use fossil fuels will dramatically change in the very near term because of the cost of doing business, paying for emissions, changing processes to avoid emissions fees, and tighter regulation.
There are three main costs that could be incurred, and corporations that fail to account
for them will be paying a much higher cost in the next decade. Let us discuss them below:
Increased cost of delayed carbon accounting
To address the reporting standards of the Paris Accord, governments will need to pass laws requiring companies to disclose their emissions.
The USA has had a shaky relationship with the Paris Accord, but still, it recently committed $370 billion to climate action. Simultaneously, the US Securities and Exchange Commission announced plans to further regulate and standardize climate-related disclosures no doubt prompting panic for many compliance managers. Those mandatory reporting regulations get phased in between 2025-2027 for direct and indirect emissions.
Increased cost of delayed carbon credit purchase
Almost no company can completely reduce its emissions to zero and many are struggling to quickly make the reductions they need today. In both situations, companies turn to carbon credits for quick results. A carbon credit represents 1 ton of CO2 removed from the atmosphere and can be used to offset some amount of emissions.
There is such a demand for carbon credits that entire markets have sprung into existence to trade and supply them. But due to a lack of foresight from business, current market demand is far outstripping the supply. This is because the largest legitimate supply of carbon credits comes from growing trees, and trees grow slowly.
A recent report by Bloomberg suggests that the price of carbon credits could surge by 3000% by 2029, Credits that cost $6 today will cost $224 in 2029 as a result of increased regulation from both industry and governments. Also because companies put off buying credits, preventing their supply from scaling, and then tried to buy them too late creating a relative lack. A recent forecast by E&Y predicts carbon credits could cost over $250 a ton by 2050.
The cost of negative public perception
As we discussed, in the coming decades the US economy could lose trillions, and simultaneously the public will have to carry costs in the billions for pledged funds, healthcare, and disasters. People will demand answers and with increased transparency on which companies are the worst emitters, it will be very easy to point fingers. Many have already anticipated this coming crisis and are racing to become carbon neutral before legislation and public opinion catch up to them.
Between regulating governments, ever-conscious customers, and risk-averse suppliers it’s a game of musical chairs and good CEOs are securing their seats now.
Enterprise companies are anticipating increased regulation and many are taking steps to carbon neutrality today, reducing emissions where possible and offsetting where it is not. Enterprise companies are also proactively seeking sources of carbon offsets, have capital reserves, and secured lines of credit ready for surprises.
In some senses enterprise companies tend to look the furthest forward - they have the resources to do so. Enterprise companies have seen the reports and understand the cost and risk of inaction just don't make sense. But what about emerging companies, the little guy - what happens to them?
Why we’re cheering for David AND Goliath
Often, it tends to be communities that have contributed the least to global warming that seem to suffer the most. But these communities are often also leading the charge: deploying renewable energy, protecting their ecology, and rapidly reducing emissions. It is vital we uplift these communities, especially those of indigenous peoples who comprise just 5% of the global population yet protect 80% of its biodiversity.
Because we understand how to work with these vibrant communities to build viable economies for ecological restoration - we are rapidly building a massive supply of carbon credits. Our credits are meant for entities of any size that are doing the right thing, being proactive, and willing to invest in the communities that are doing the work.
We want to work with proactive enterprises to scale suppliers and be their insurance against surging carbon credit costs. Savimbo is a champion for the smallfarmer in the Amazon basin and anyone in the marketplace who will work with us. We want equity for all — we want to help everyone win.
Don't worry big business we love you too - with Savimbo the future can be a big win for everyone. Just work with us we want to scale your supply."

- Traditional ceremony with the elders is available but not required.
- Visitors must be willing to transfer knowledge (academic information about species studied), credit sources (publications of indigenous knowledge must credit the local sources), and release photographs for locals to use in selling biodiversity credits.
- Visitors must be fit (i.e. Tough Mudder or endurance sports best, but able to pass a US Forest Service pack test at minimum), obtain travel insurance, and be willing to sign a waiver.

Savimbo values Trust. It’s important to us that all our Growers are aware of the terms of the program, feel comfortable talking to us directly, and agree to deal fairly with everyone involved in our project. Below you can learn more about our land quality rating system, calculate micropayments, and review our carbon credit contracts.
Grower information
For all Savimbo growers
Year
2022
We pay landowners a regional day rate based on the quality of the land they maintain. Then 20% of the funds from Carbon Credit sale and resale. You can calculate your rate below.
Land quality is recalculated on a monthly basis and can be improved by:
Reducing hunting so the animals come back
Planting >5 native tree species in a plot
Cultivating natural plants and flowers
Applying biochar
Savimbo will provide trees and pay the cost of replanting services, but the landowner must agree to replant alongside the crew, monitor trees, and validate survival for one year.

Grower contracts
Our contracts are designed to be transparent, fair, and scalable.
Please read the sample contracts fully, but take note of the following elements.
- We do annual recurring contracts.
- Growers get 20% of all revenue from their credits.
- We subsidize growers with monthly micropayments in advance (like fair-trade coffee).
Our growers are independent. They own their own land, and their own trees, and we like it that way. We are a bit like a farming collective, or an agro-futures market. We help our growers aggregate to sell their crop of carbon credits internationally which gives them more economic power.
We believe in aligned incentives. Everyone we work with has the same motivations, and benefits from the same outcome: store carbon = make money = improve lives."

We’re unabashedly nerdy. In fact, we go full nerd, real quick. That’s one of the reasons we’re successful — we know when to get down to the nitty gritty data!
Most people don’t know what their carbon footprint is. So here’s a quick tool that will help you estimate what your personal impact is on planet Earth. Of course, we’d prefer it if you chose to work with our farmers for reducing your footprint, but just simple awareness does a lot for behavior."

Technology is only valuable to the extent it allows us to live meaningful lives.

Technology is a tool.
One of our values is Now. We live in the Now, we work in the realities of Now, and we turn off our phones for the Now.
We like technology that is sturdy, solves real-world problems and enables quality human interactions. We teach our growers how to use emerging technologies to achieve digital equity and financial independence, but we’re selective about the technologies we introduce.
Drone scans
Savimbo uses drone scans for aerial photography, videos, topographical mapping, and 3D scans (LiDAR and point-cloud photogrammetry).
This data helps us certify our carbon credits, assess biodiversity and ecosystems, track and compare our reforestation plots, establish land rights for indigenous groups, and create promotional videos for our admittedly rabid fans.
The video to the right is our first drone scan. We validate our plots, track carbon sequestration and jungle integrity, and certify our credits using drones. A big part of Savimbo's mandate is to train local talent with trustless verification methods instead of importing outsiders to manage projects.
We like being off the grid and many of our growers do too. We do install satellite internet stations for community use, medivac, and to enable electronic payments but we use GPS the rest of the time.
Our blockchain lives in the cloud and we use it to track payments, but we use the most stable regional banking system for transactable good for micro payments - based on Growers feedback.
We’ve discovered game photography can replace a lot of hunting-for-sport activities but we don’t take photographs often so as not to disrupt wildlife.
We use mobile phones for on-the-ground tracking. Tropical forests are not made for technology and we love Otterbox because it works.
We have a partnership with Garmin and most of our work is done outside of cell-phone range thanks to their support."

Savimbo works hard to be something called “additional” in the carbon market. This means that we don’t just stop deforestation, we also add forest. This removes carbon from the atmosphere, and actively reverses the negative effects of emissions on the atmosphere.
Our trees have a lot more going for them than the average daffodil. We’re not only in the business of carbon removal, we sell carbon credits with holistic ecological benefits. That means all the good stuff too. So lets talk about the good stuff.
We plant no less than 5 native species per plot, and one of the species must be a food or crop tree selected by the farmer for its revenue potential.
Amazonian trees can grow very quickly and live for up to 300 years. The parts of the Amazon we work in often grow to full-standing-height within six years simply by removing cattle. So we design our tree plantations to aid in this regrowth, rather than replacing it. We also continually A/B test our plots to make sure that the trees we are planting have the maximum chances of survivability.
Our farmers are paid for initial planting, and again at 6 months and 1 year based on independent validators who count the trees. We pay local women to collect seeds from native jungle and provide seedlings from their homes where it provides an independent revenue stream while caregiving for young children.
We educate our farmers on the beneficial effect of monkeys and birds to eat fruit and spread seeds. By paying additional money for animal species monitored on reforested plots we encourage biodiversity and re-establish beneficial life cycles."
