Spring graduations can be the perfect time to stop and celebrate not only everything a person has accomplished so far but also all that is in store for them in the future. They call it a commencement because it’s the beginning of something, not the end.\n",

      "Congratulations! I have loved watching you grow up to be such a creative, smart, and fun kid! I am so proud of you, and I can’t wait to see what you will become when you grow up. But don’t grow up too fast! Enjoy being a kid and enjoy today. I love you.\n",
      "P.S. Let’s go get ice cream to celebrate!\n",
      "For the Gen Z’er who is graduating High School:\n",
      "You did it!! Wow, these last few years have been hard on this whole planet, but especially for your generation. With delayed or canceled classes, proms, and school trips, you really went through a lot in your high school career. Think of the stories you’ll be able to tell! I am so proud of you and how you handled the many (so many!) challenges of the last 2+ years, and I’m equally excited to see what you do from here on out. Congratulations!\n",
      "P.S. I think you’re snatched! (Did I use that word right? I googled it)\n",
      "For the college graduate:\n",
      "A big CONGRATS to you!! It seems like just yesterday I was watching you graduate from preschool, and now you’re graduating from college! It has been a true privilege to watch you grow up and now celebrate this next big milestone in your life. I could not be any prouder. Cheers!\n",
      "P.S. Sorry America still hasn’t done anything about student loan debt\n",
      "Now wipe away your tears of nostalgia and pride, and get that card in the mail! And with PS Post – mailing greeting cards from your phone or computer is easier than ever!\n",
      "PS Post is the easiest way to mail cards with gifts – from any device to any mailbox, any time. Simply choose a card, write your personal message, add an e-gift card (we print it as a QR code!), and tell us where to mail it. You’ll have brought so much joy to their day with just a few clicks.\n",
