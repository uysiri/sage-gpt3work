5,https://myrainplan.com/benefits-of-green-infrastructure-for-stormwater-runoff/,"Wet Weather Turns into Water Runoff
Stormwater runoff is the single largest cause of water pollution, flooding and property damage. According to FEMA, just one inch of rain can cause $25,000 of damage to your home. More than 22.4 million US properties are at risk of flooding this year, and annual damages from flooding in the US are expected to increase by 30% by the end of the century.
Stormwater also poses a massive threat to our water pollution: 70% of all water pollution comes from pollutants carried in stormwater runoff. An estimated 10 trillion gallons of untreated stormwater runoff, containing everything from raw sewage to trash to toxins, enters US waterways from city sewer systems every year, polluting the environment and our drinking water supplies.
So what can green infrastructure like green roofs, permeable pavers, and rain gardens do about flooding and polluted water runoff?
Modern Methods for Sustainable Water Management
When focusing on ways to navigate stream pollution and polluted runoff, engineers have developed ways to offset water runoff from rapidly entering into our waterways. Here are projects most common for preventing water pollution.
Green Roofs
Green roofs are covered with growing media and vegetation that soak up rain and enable infiltration and evapotranspiration. Installing a green roof on your property can significantly reduce your stormwater runoff and by doing so reduce flood risk and water pollution. A study done by a University of Toronto civil engineer and co-researchers at the school’s Green Roof Innovation Testing Lab showed that green roofs have the capacity to capture an average of 70% of rainfall over a given time.
Permeable Pavers
When rainfall flows over standard concrete driveways and sideways (impermeable surfaces) it contributes to our stormwater problems by picking up pollution, overwhelming our local water systems and posing a flood risk. The switch to permeable pavers helps prevent flooding and reduces pollution by allowing water to seep back into the ground and be filtered at the same time. For example, if you have a 1,000 square foot driveway, permeable pavers enable you to store close to 3,000 gallons of water under your driveway. Additionally, pavers are up to four times stronger than concrete and last two times longer. Permeable pavers have joints which make it flexible and durable as the ground changes. Unlike concrete paveways, it won’t crack when there is an earthquake or when the ground beneath contracts and expands. They also have a higher resale value than concrete because of their longer lifespan and visual appearance.
Rain Gardens
Rain gardens also known as Bioretention, are shallow vegetated basins that collect and absorb stormwater runoff from rooftops, sidewalks, and streets.
According to the Groundwater Foundation, compared to a conventional lawn, rain gardens allow for 30% more water to soak into the ground. Rain gardens are also effective in removing up to 90% of nutrients and chemicals and up to 80% of sediments from the rainwater runoff. A rain garden neutralizes pollutants and allows water to soak into the ground rather than overwhelming our water systems or contribute to flooding.
In an analysis of Seattle area rain gardens, researchers estimated that each one can filter as many as 30,000 gallons of stormwater a year, enough to fill a bathtub 600 times. Another study in Burnsville, MN showed a 93% reduction in stormwater runoff volume after the installation of 17 rain gardens in a 5.3 acre neighborhood.
Green Infrastructure is Good for Your Wallet, Too.
It’s easy to see that integrating green infrastructure in urban areas and using the power of nature can have significant positive results for our cities and the environment. You too can introduce green infrastructure to your property while enjoying all the benefits—and it can be more accessible than you may think. It has been estimated that green infrastructure is 5%-30% less costly to construct and about 25% less costly over its life cycle than traditional infrastructure. On top of that, green infrastructure increases property value too.
Using green infrastructure in construction and increasing vegetation and tree cover can increase your property value, whether you’re a homeowner or developer. For an office building, adding landscape adds approximately 7% to the average rental rate. There’s benefit for retail too: consumers are willing to spend more on products, visit more frequently, or travel farther to shop in areas with attractive landscaping, good tree cover or green streets. For homeowners, green infrastructure can add great curb appeal and value to your home. Landscaping that is properly done can add 10%-15% to the value of a home.
There’s even more financial benefit with the lower energy bills that come with green infrastructure. Green roofs provide insulation and help keep buildings cold in the summer and warm in the winter. Research published by the National Research Council of Canada found that an extensive green roof reduced the daily energy demand for air conditioning in the summer by over 75%. Even just adding trees to your property can make a difference: trees can reduce the heat load on your home by 10% to 30% cutting air-conditioning costs in the summer and reducing heating requirements by a similar percentage in the winter.
Create a Rainplan to Find Green Infrastructure Opportunities on Your Property
Installing green infrastructure becomes even more appealing with government stormwater incentives and rebates which can significantly reduce installation costs. But the process to apply for these incentives can be burdensome, confusing and lengthy.
Rainplan can take care of all the hard work from start to finish. Discover which incentives are available to you with Rainplan’s online platform. After reviewing your Rainplan, if you are ready to move forward, Rainplan will then handle all of the paperwork, match you with reputable installers and green infrastructure experts and secure your funding upfront.

6,https://myrainplan.com/best-residential-rainwater-harvesting-system/,"Interested in investing in a rainwater harvesting system but do not know where to start? That’s ok. With a mountain of options, often complex local and state regulations, and confusing or nonexistent stormwater management incentives – it can be overwhelming to know what type of solution works best for you.
Using Rainwater
The kind of rainwater capture systems that are best for your situation is generally impacted by a few different metrics: (1) what size you are looking for, (2) the intended use of the water you are capturing, (3) your aesthetic preferences, and (4) local or state regulations.
Whether you own a 2,000 square foot (sq. ft.) residential home or a 20,000 sq. ft. commercial warehouse facility, the best residential rain water harvesting solution is the one that directly manages the stormwater generated by your impervious surface, potentially saves on property taxes or stormwater fees, and protects your local environment from potentially hazardous runoff that negatively impacts it.
Arguably the most crucial point to consider when you are considering investing in a rainwater harvesting system is the sizing of the system you want and the capacity for collection. A simple rain barrel attached to your gutter can be as small as 50 gallons and up to 250 gallons or more for multi-rain barrel combination systems. Cisterns, generally much larger than rain barrels, vary from as small as 500 gallons up to 5,000 gallons or more. Measuring your rain capture system varies dependent mainly on what style you are interested in, your budget, and the intended use you need for your situation. For example, large, galvanized metal cisterns can cost as much as $4,000 with delivery, whereas a simple, do-it-yourself food barrel conversion can be as cheap as $99. It is also important to remember that professional installation is often recommended (and sometimes required depending on your location) for larger systems (e.g. industrial cisterns). This is because of their weight, the need to create a stable foundation, and the connection to water collection systems (e.g. gutters) is more complex.
As mentioned above, another essential factor to consider when reviewing potential options for your rainwater capture system is the intended use of the water you are collecting. Rain captured through a rainwater harvesting system is often captured directly through a screened opening at the top of the system or through roofs that connect to a gutter/downspout. In most cases, the water captured is only safe for outdoor uses (e.g., car washing, gardening, etc.) and not for non-potable and potable uses (e.g., plumbing, drinking, bathing, cooking). If you are interested in a rainwater capture system for non-potable and potable uses, you should keep a few considerations in mind.
First, many cities and states in the U.S. have regulatory controls aimed at identifying and separating captured water from municipal water (treated/regulated city or state water). It is best practice to first connect with agencies that regulate water (e.g., Department of Water, Department of Environment) so they can provide you with direction.
Second, a system that is integrated into your home (e.g., for plumbing) will be more expensive than a system that is not because of the advanced nature of these systems (e.g., plumbing materials required, treatment of the water, and professional installation).
Third, the system should be sized correctly based on the intended use(s) and local geographic considerations. In other words, it is best practice to ensure that you have enough storage necessary for the use and that you live in an area where rainfall is plentiful enough to keep the system functional.
Aesthetic preferences are another consideration when deciding what rainwater harvesting system is best for your property. Rain barrels and cisterns are offered in a variety of different sizes. As well, both offer various styles tailored to aesthetic situations. In the case of rain, barrels are generally installed on residential property uses, so the styling is primarily catered towards matching the average home or blending in against an exterior wall. In the case of cisterns, they can be installed on larger, rural residential lots or, often, in commercial or industrial uses. Therefore, the style largely depends on where they will be placed (e.g. alongside exterior walls of a barn or on the roof of a downtown skyscraper).
Last but not least, the final rain water solutions must consider if they apply to local, county, and state regulations that may impact your choice(s) and installation. Nearly every city, county, and even some states in the U.S. have some kind of development code or regulatory ordinance text regulating what can be built or added to all types of property (e.g., municipal development policies/or codes). These codes include regulatory language to manage the infrastructure built on all types of lots. In some cases, your homeowner’s association (HOA) might also regulate the kind(s) of additions you can make to your property. It is best practice to understand what kind of impact they will have on your choice.

25,https://myrainplan.com/commercial-property-drought-resistant-landscaping-ideas/,"With cities moving into stricter water conservation methods, it has never been a better time to transform commercial property drought landscaping. You might have heard of xeriscape gardens or done your own research for the best rain barrels. Still, there are numerous creative ways to start your drought resistant landscaping design.
Whether you own a rental building, an office building, multi-use complexes, or any development, you can maximize your investment by using stormwater best practices to pay for property updates and UPGRADES. Here are good ideas for affordable and inexpensive drought tolerant landscaping ideas.
Commercial Property Drought Landscaping & Maintenance
When considering landscaping ideas like natural dry creek beds, rain barrels, cisterns, drought resistant landscaping, it’s essential to consider what the maintenance would look like on your commercial property. When people transform their parking lots, their lawns, or other areas of their property, they don’t account for the ongoing maintenance of their decisions. When it comes to drought resistant upgrades, we chose stormwater best practices and green infrastructure practices because they help solve water problems and double as a resilient maintenance strategy since many of these tools last longer than traditional landscaping ideas and also help to prevent property damage.
Rainwater Cisterns
Rainwater cisterns are popular for large commercial properties because of their money-saving properties. Not only can stormwater cisterns help you save on your watering bills, but they can also be an opportunity for you to save on stormwater fees, help with refrigeration costs, and be integrated into your greywater system.
Take, for example, what many Whole Foods grocery stores are doing on their properties. Huge above-ground (one of two cisterns types) cisterns collect roof rainwater and recycle it by using it to irrigate native landscaping- a drought landscaping saver- and flush store toilets. The Houston, TX Whole Foods even uses the cistern to pressurize water onto the roof to cycle through a coolant system that helps lower refrigeration costs in the store.
While your property might not have the budget and roof potential of a Whole Foods conglomerate, cisterns are still manageable, affordable, and usable on all commercial property types.
Dry Creek Bed Landscaping
Dry creek beds are rocky pathways that look like dry river beds and can be a decorative addition to any xeriscaped yard or lush yard. The reason why dry creeks are significant is due to commercial property maintenance. Dry creeks help with water runoff, moving water down into the ground, away from foundations, and directed into areas of your choosing. Meaning no wasted water and no property water damage. When it comes to drought resistant yard ideas, the dry creek is an excellent tool used in xeriscaping. They can add beautification to any yard while removing grass and other non-native plants that would take considerably more water. Xeriscaping can save water by removing non-native plants and grasses and replacing the area with rock and sand.
Xeriscaping: the popular tool among drought resistant landscaping ideas
Xeriscaping is one of the most beneficial methods for moving your commercial property to be resilient in any weather. The benefits:
-Use less water
-Native plants will thrive in drought weather and help to pull any water runoff down into the soils
-You can implement many stormwater tools into xeriscaping and have some of your projects paid for through stormwater incentive programs
With xeriscaping, your property will likely be removing pavement and pulling out the grass to transform into a commercial property with limited maintenance. In some areas, removing pavement and installing a dry creek or permeable pavers can land you a pretty hefty rebate from the government. Many of these drought resistant tools provide you with stormwater rebates.
Free Rain Barrels Near Me
Free rain barrels near me is one of the most searched terms for landscaping because people are becoming more aware of how the government is willing to reimburse you for managing your stormwater with rain barrels. However, did you know you can also be reimbursed for installing dry creeks, xeriscaping, removing pavement, adding a cistern, and many other bio-retention and stormwater projects? Depending on your city, most have programs dedicated to encouraging commercial property owners to create sustainable landscapes. Each program has its own requirements, but you can stack incentives on top of each other and maximize your reimbursement and utility savings.

All you need to do is type in your property address, and our stormwater incentive match tool will find your programs with a rebate, grant, and fee reduction incentives.

- Client: Amy Butler
- Project: Residential Green Roof
- Geographic Area: Washington DC Metro Area
“You know there’s Gladys on the corner, and she knows everything about everyone. The first time I wore my collar out the front door…everyone knew what I did for a living”.
Over half a million people live in Washington, DC, yet each ward in the city feels like a small town. Just ask Amy Butler, a resident of Ward 5 in the Queens Chapel neighborhood, whose job as a pastor naturally lends itself to community building in the area.
“This was one of the first planned developments in DC. Most of my neighbors are in their 80s or 90s, and they tell me if you want to do a block party, you have to organize it”, says Butler. “Douglas is my next-door neighbor, and he’s 94, and he likes to garden. He’s always asking if he can clean up my alley, and I bake him cookies. It’s a cute thing”.
Butler is a force for understanding the dynamics of people living collectively together.
“I love to garden, but I lived in Manhattan the past decade, so I haven’t had space, but it’s one of the reasons I love being here,” states Butler. “I can have a little garden patch in the back. You know, tomatoes, zucchinis, and jalapeños”.
After New York City, Butler initially moved to a Maryland neighborhood known for progressive environmental incentives.
“I lived in a cohousing community in Takoma Park, and we had a green roof there, so I was very familiar with what it looks like,” says Butler.
In her new community of Queens Chapel, Butler took a few of her prior experiences and decided to add a green roof to her new home.
“When I moved into this house, I did major remodeling. I had to renovate everything, and I was thinking about doing a green roof although it wasn’t leaking or anything”, reports Butler. “I just thought as long as I’m doing all this, I should take care of it. The roof was like 70 years old”.
After being referred by a DC group, Butler came to Rainplan with ideas for a green roof garden on her flat roof home-a a popular style for the area.
“It turns out my roof is perfect for a green roof. I like it. Not only has it already changed the temperature inside the house, but it also says to my neighbors that I care about the earth”, says Butler. “It shows my values.”
It took around four months for installation to fit a green roof onto Butler’s home. With cooperation from DC programs, architects, and Rainplan, the project became affordable and easily adjusted to her already in motion renovations.
“I can’t even imagine a person going to the DC government and filing for an incentive. Rainplan is like the person who holds your hand through the whole process. Everyone I’ve met has been delightful to work with”, states Butler.
Green roofs are a popular choice among residents and business complexes with flat roofs in the DC area. A green roof can weigh less than a standard shingled, lasts twice as long, and has increased property resale value.
“I think people need to see it,” shares Butler. “I feel like this neighborhood is prime potential for Rainplan because all houses and the roofs are flat. So there has to be a way to let people know what the options are”.
For now, Butler looks forward to the future possibilities for her new space and caring for her new green roof garden.
“It’s the joke of the neighborhood. ‘Oh, Amy’s watering her roof.’ I try to water once or twice a week”, quips Butler.
“My partner Ryan went up there once to weed, which was funny because he was Face Timing me and asking, “Is this a weed? Is this a weed?”. Together, we are figuring out how to take care of it”.
With incentive funding, expedited processing with contractors, and someone there to guide you throughout the process, Rainplan can help take a vision and turn it into something achievable. Sure Butler is an ambitious go-getter with experience in mobilizing communities and making things happen. However, even the most ambitious of us still need help in navigating the complex government incentive process.
“I would like to do permeable pavers in my back patio area when the timing is right. I had such a positive experience with the incentive system that I was like, ‘why not do something else?’ I would love to work with rainplan again”.",amy butler green roof changing neighborhood client amy butler project residential green roof geographic area washington dc metro area know gladys corner knows everything everyone first time wore collar front door everyone knew living half million people live washington dc yet ward city feels like small town ask amy butler resident ward queens chapel neighborhood whose job pastor naturally lends community building area one first planned developments dc neighbors 80s 90s tell want block party organize says butler douglas next door neighbor likes garden always asking clean alley bake cookies cute thing butler force understanding dynamics people living collectively together love garden lived manhattan past decade space one reasons love states butler little garden patch back know tomatoes zucchinis jalapenos new york city butler initially moved maryland neighborhood known progressive environmental incentives lived cohousing community takoma park green roof familiar looks like says butler new community queens chapel butler took prior experiences decided add green roof new home moved house major remodeling renovate everything thinking green roof although leaking anything reports butler thought long take care roof like years old referred dc group butler came rainplan ideas green roof garden flat roof home popular style area turns roof perfect green roof like already changed temperature inside house also says neighbors care earth says butler shows values took around four months installation fit green roof onto butler home cooperation dc programs architects rainplan project became affordable easily adjusted already motion renovations even imagine person going dc government filing incentive rainplan like person holds hand whole process everyone met delightful work states butler green roofs popular choice among residents business complexes flat roofs dc area green roof weigh less standard shingled lasts twice long increased property resale value think people need see shares butler feel like neighborhood prime potential rainplan houses roofs flat way let people know options butler looks forward future possibilities new space caring new green roof garden joke neighborhood oh amy watering roof try water twice week quips butler partner ryan went weed funny face timing asking weed weed together figuring take care incentive funding expedited processing contractors someone guide throughout process rainplan help take vision turn something achievable sure butler ambitious go getter experience mobilizing communities making things happen however even ambitious us still need help navigating complex government incentive process would like permeable pavers back patio area timing right positive experience incentive system like something else would love work rainplan

31,https://myrainplan.com/financial-literacy-101-tax-benefits/,"Financial Literacy 101: Can Expenditures or Investments in voluntary stormwater retrofits provide property owners a tax benefit?
Since it is financial literacy month, it seemed timely to scope out an overview of the tax benefits of stormwater retrofits. This article introduces property owners to the topic with two more pieces to follow that spiral deeper into the specifics.
—-
Property Owner Tax Benefits
Stormwater property best management practices are a critical investment to help improve the sustainment of our real estate and our local community. They’re a major component of economics with financial literacy. Volunteering to improve the manner in which your property handles stormwater runoff can have numerous environmental and economic benefits at a personal and community level ranging from protecting your real estate from flooding and erosion to protecting and improving your local community’s water quality and flooding. It also helps increase your property’s real estate resale and/or rental value, reduces property maintenance costs, and reduces your monthly or annual stormwater utility fees in some localities. In some areas, your local government may reward you with an incentive rebate or grant to improve your property’s water runoff from storm events.
We (Rainplan) often talk about the above benefits of stormwater for property improvements because they’re the more widely accessible and attainable benefits across the national landscape. However, there is another economic benefit that is not widely taken advantage of but should be! Welcome to stormwater financial literacy 101!
Stormwater Tax Advantages
Stormwater best management practices are considered land improvements, and land improvements are depreciable against your taxable income.
Depreciation is an accounting tool that accounts for the loss in asset value from the gradual deterioration of an asset’s condition and use. Its purpose is to compensate the owner for the value that the investment loses every year. In essence, it’s a trade-off for property owners and a tax incentive. It is not very well known that land improvements can be depreciated as capital assets. The Internal Revenue Service allows you to depreciate assets used in accordance with their useful lives. While the IRS considers land to have an indefinite useful life (in most cases), many improvements we make to land gradually wear out. Examples such as landscaping with plants, fences, curbs, parking, irrigation, and, most importantly, drainage are examples of land improvements that gradually deteriorate over time. These improvements can be depreciated when built and/or replaced.
The depreciation for these assets can potentially qualify for an accelerated 15 yr depreciation schedule versus the traditional 20-year period. The depreciation schedule for residential real estate property is 27.5 yr. That means you can spread out the investment cost over a shorter period, giving you a significant annual benefit to your taxes. Also, it is essential to differentiate the repair of land improvements.
When making repairs to an existing land improvement, you can deduct 100% of those costs in the year they are incurred.
Land Improvement Projects
Each type of land improvement project (rain gardens, green roofs, permeable pavers, dry wells, etc.) is different with varying tax calculations. For example, with green roofs, you need to segregate the costs considered home repair (100% deductible in the year incurred) versus new functional land improvements for the drainage use that would be depreciated. In contrast, the tax benefits of a rain garden are more straightforward. The costs of a new bioretention facility are depreciated over its useful life because of its benefit to the building structures and the local public infrastructure it supports (city stormwater and sewer systems). Perhaps the most utilized are land improvement projects. With stormwater, most likely, your drainage systems would fall under land improvements. Stormwater best management practices such as french drains, downspouts and gutter systems, bioswales, and dry wells could qualify as depreciable assets.
This is not intended to be tax guidance, and as with any tax subject, it is essential to consult a licensed accountant for your specific situation. This is more of a quick introduction to a financial literacy workshop. Still, Rainplan can help educate and guide you toward stormwater retrofit projects best situated for your property. (Quick plug, IN ADDITION, we can help you find the most cost-effective financing, and in the DC metropolitan area, we can connect you to qualified GI contractors when you create your free Rainplan.)
With stormwater management practices utilizing green infrastructure, it is essential to look at these investments as functional improvements to your property that play a crucial part in neighboring sustainability.

General Questions About Green Roofs
How do green roofs work?
A regular roof sends stormwater right to storm drains and streams. Meanwhile, plants on a green roof slow down rain when it reaches t
he roof. When this happens the water absorbs into the soil or evaporates into the air.
The roots of the plants also keep the soil in place as it removes pollution from the water. Together, plants and soil reduce how much stormwater runoff reaches the ground, storm drains, and creeks.
The best locations for a green roof are sunny, horizontal spaces with a small slope. It’s also important that a building can support the weight of a green roof.
What are the benefits of a living roof?
- Save you money on energy bills.
- Extra insulation for your property
- Help you retain and redirect rainfall
- Prevent flooding
- Extend the life of your roof by as much as 10 years
- Increase usable green space
What type of plants can I grow on my living (green) roof?
Intensive commercial grade green roofs can support a wide variety of shrubs, and even some small trees. A less intensive project may include wildflowers and drought-tolerant herbaceous perennials. The most common sort of plants that can be observed in a green roof is all varieties of sedum, perennial plants with thick, succulent leaves, fleshy stems, and clusters of star-shaped flowers. There are over 600 varieties of sedum, so it’s always a good idea to speak to a local specialist about which type are best for your geographic area. Your local rain planner can help you get connected, so just reach out if you’re seriously considering a green roof project and we can help.
How do I know if I can use my existing roof?
We have an allowance available to complete a structural assessment. The assessment is performed to ensure the roof can sustain the weight of the Green Roof. In addition, if you desire, we can give you a price to replace the roof but most people place the Green Roof onto their existing roof. A Green Roof also extends the life of the home’s roof.
What elements are necessary for a successful green roof project?
There are a few key factors that go into executing your project on a new or existing roof. The most important considerations are:
- The Integrity of the Waterproofing Membrane: The roof’s membrane needs to be in good condition to make sure the roof will remain waterproof.
- Structure Load Constraints: The roof needs to be able to hold the added weight of the Green Roof. Before a green roof project starts, a structural assessment needs to be conducted to ensure the roof’s ability to hold that weight. In some cases, additional reinforcements need to be installed to support the added weight.
- The Slope of the Roof: The EcoCline green roof (just one of many brands) can be installed normally on a roof that has less than 3/12 pitch. Any steeper than that some structural components need to be introduced. Due to the implications of a mismatch of this particular criteria, if it’s not crystal clear, we highly recommend consulting with a licensed installer to double-check the specifications. Let us know, and we’ll be happy to match you with a green roof specialist.
- Logistics and Access to the Roof: Finally, our installers need to know what kind of roof access is present at the property to make sure they have the right equipment to get on the roof. Before starting the installation process we will have a structural engineer examine your property to ascertain whether or not any structural supports are needed.
How long does a Green Roof last?
Two things degrade the roof – expansion due to weather and exposure to the UV rays. A green roof dramatically extends the life of the roof by protecting it from those elements. The lifespan of a green roof is over 50 years.
How many days does it take to complete a green roof project?
Once the structural assessment is made and if the roof is fit for a green roof the actual installation can be done in a day or two. Our installers put the roof components in the facility prior to the job and only have to put the pieces together on site. Which reduces the time it takes to finish the project significantly.
Does the owner have to leave the property while the Green Roof is being installed?
If it’s just the Green Roof, which is an overlay of the existing roof, there’s no penetration in the roof, so therefore there’s no requirement for anyone to leave the home. These types of green roof installations typically take about 1 to 3 days.
How much does a green roof typically cost?
Green Roofs typically cost between $20 and $30 dollars per square foot if no roof replacements or structural reinforcements are needed. Structural reinforcements typically cost $3-4 per square foot and roof replacements (with PTO) typically cost $6-7 per square foot.
Can I put chairs on my Green Roof to be able to use it as a hangout area?
A Green Roof is like a lawn in that if you walk the same path every day and sit in the same chair you’ll wear a path in the lawn just like the green roof.
Do Green Roofs help with Heat Island Effect?
Cities are significantly hotter than surrounding areas. This is called the Urban Heat Island Effect. Buildings absorb and re-emit the sun’s heat increasing temperatures in urban areas. Plants absorb heat and provide shade. Green roof temperatures can be 30–40°F lower than those of conventional roofs and can reduce city-wide ambient temperatures by up to 5°F. Green roofs can also help reduce the distribution of dust and pollutants throughout the air which reduces air pollution and smog.
Are green roofs effective in retaining stormwater?
A study done by a University of Toronto civil engineer and co-researchers at the school’s Green Roof Innovation Testing Lab showed that green roofs have the capacity to capture an average of 70% of rainfall over a given time. For an average 1500 roof in DC that equates to saving 26,000 gallons a year from going into the sewer system.
Are green roofs fire retardant?
Living roofs have much lower burning heat load (the heat generated when a substance burns) than conventional roofs do which reduces fire risk to the building.
Are Green Roofs compatible with Solar?
Green roofs can be integrated with solar panels and actually increases their efficiency. By reducing the temperature of your roof, your living roof actually improves the performance of photovoltaic cells. Additionally, integrating green roofs with solar panels gives you the opportunity to stack available incentives and rebates.
Does having a green roof affect your property value?
Green roofs, like other forms of green infrastructure, are beautiful and increase property value. In New York City for example, apartments with green roofs had about 16% higher rental fees than buildings without living roof space. The same goes for residential property owners, green roofs can boost property value by 15%!
Is it true that green roofs reduce outside noise?
Installing a living roof can reduce sound from outside by up to 50 decibels. Replace annoying honking and construction noise with peace and quiet.
Are there energy savings associated with a Green Roof?
Living roofs provide insulation and help keep buildings cold in the summer and warm in the winter. This leads to significant energy savings. Research published by the National Research Council of Canada found that an extensive green roof reduced the daily energy demand for air conditioning in the summer by over 75%.
What if my green roof gets damaged?
There’s a warranty for the establishment if something that major happens. In most cases, damage will be covered under your homeowner’s insurance as a fixture.

34,https://myrainplan.com/green-roofs-project-for-2022/,"An aerial view of a standard city or neighborhood usually shows a sea of rooftops made of asphalt, concrete, and tar. What a beautiful world we would live in if those bleak rooftops were covered with lush, green vegetation. Let us introduce you to a roof idea, a rooftop lawn with sound minimization, and a live green landscape.
Green roofs, just like the name suggests, are a rooftop lined with greenery. A green roof is an extension of the existing roof that involves multiple layers: a durable waterproofing and root repellent system, a stormwater drainage system, filter cloth, a lightweight growing medium, and a variety of plants, like succulents, vegetables, trees, shrubs or perennials.
The addition of vegetation to a roof is not only beautiful, but it changes the barren landscape of conventional roofs into useful space. For example, standard roofs allow rain to rush over the hard surfaces and onto the street without vegetation. Stormwater run-off can cause serious issues for property damage and leads to pollutants in our local water systems. In summer, green roofs can retain up to 90% of precipitation and 40% in winter.
Reducing stormwater run-off is only one perk of a roof lawn. Green roofs come with many benefits — both for the environment and your wallet!
Top 10 Reasons You Need A Green Roof
Like all green infrastructure practices, there are more benefits to green roofs than being aesthetically pleasing. Green roofs come with many environmental and economic benefits, here are 10:
1. Last longer and prevent leaks. Green roofs protect underlying roof finish which last three to five times longer than conventional roofs. The thick layers protect roofs from UV rays and extreme temperatures which over time cause damage and leaking.
2. Significant energy savings. Green roofs provide insulation and help keep buildings cold in the summer and warm in the winter. This leads to significant energy savings. Research published by the National Research Council of Canada found that an extensive green roof reduced the daily energy demand for air conditioning in the summer by over 75%
3. Property value and curb appeal. Green roof houses, like other forms of green infrastructure, are beautiful and increase property value. For example, in New York City, apartments with green rooftop gardens had about 16% higher rental fees than buildings without green roof space. The same goes for residential property owners, and green roofs can boost property value by 15%.
4. Beautiful space to enjoy. Many green roofs offer new areas to be appreciated that are beautiful and improve quality of life. These new spaces can be a peaceful retreat for both people and animals. Add a patio and chairs for an urban oasis and say hello to any visiting birds since green roofs provide new habitats for wildlife. So while most people call it a green roof, it is more like a rooftop garden.
5. Incentive opportunities make green roofs affordable. Green roofs also offer benefits to cities–which helps you out too! Cities benefit from less stormwater run-off, lower energy use, cleaner air, higher property values – the list goes on. That is why local municipalities offer incentives for property owners to install green roofs. In D.C., for example, you can get green roofs for up to 50% off with incentives.
6. Compatibility with solar panels. A green roof house can be integrated with solar panels and increase their efficiency. Green roofs reduce the temperature of your roof, and this improves the performance of photovoltaic cells. Additionally, incorporating green roofs with solar panels allows you to stack available incentives and rebates.
7. Noise filter. Green roofs can reduce sound from outside by up to 50 decibels. Replace annoying honking and construction noise with quiet.
8. Fire retardant. Green roofs have a much lower burning heat load (the heat generated when a substance burns) than conventional roofs, reducing fire risk to the building.
9. Leads to LEED Certification. Green roofs lead to LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification for your building. In DC, for example, LEED certification is required for all new construction and significant renovation of the larger federal district and commercial buildings. Commercial green roofs are built very similarly to residential green roofs and so incorporating a green roof into the design of a new construction project saves time and money. Additionally, in many jurisdictions, LEED certification means tax breaks and other financial incentives.
10. Reduce urban heat island effect. Cities are significantly hotter than surrounding areas, and this is called the Urban Heat Island Effect. Buildings absorb and re-emit the sun’s heat increasing temperatures, but plants absorb heat and provide shade. Green roof temperatures can be 30–40°F lower than conventional roofs and can reduce city-wide ambient temperatures by up to 5°F. Green roofs can also help reduce the distribution of dust and pollutants throughout the air, which reduces air pollution and smog.
Green Rooftop Incentives
Considering the many exceptional benefits of installing a green roof, it may not be a surprise that green roofs typically cost more than conventional roofs. This becomes the most challenging thing about green roofs: the upfront costs. The benefits make up for the price increase, but what’s even better is the availability of green roof incentives, which can reduce costs significantly. In D.C., for example, rebates can reduce the cost of green roofs up to 50%. This allows property owners to install a green roof at a comparable price to a conventional roof and enjoy the benefits that come with green roofs! And many are–there are 2.3 million square feet of green roofs in D.C. within just 69 square miles.

35,https://myrainplan.com/green-tech-startups/,"With green tech companies on the rise, we took a moment to poll some of our team on sustainable tech startups that are piquing their interest.
Today is a great day (Happy Earth Day!) to talk about our mission to bridge the gap in stormwater management opportunities and how we can transform water quality by mitigating water runoff. However, we talk about that every day, so to mix it up, we’re sharing other ways in which environmental entrepreneurs are taking off. From permeable concrete startups to environment-friendly technology, these ecologically-minded startups are introducing the world to sustainable tech.
All links go directly to the company’s FAQ page.
Mission: To rebalance the Planet’s Carbon Cycle using the power of plants.
The quick cut: If you’ve ever wondered what plants absorb the most c02…this green tech company is for you. They’re using genes from pumpkin and green algae to help poplar trees use less energy and retain more carbon.
This genetic engineering startup is working on creating trees that would grow more quickly and capture more carbon than their previous family members. Photorespiration is turning carbon dioxide into byproducts that the plant breaks down over time. Still, this takes up a lot of plant energy which means they have to release some carbon. Living Carbon is taking genes from pumpkin and green algae and splicing them to get this process to use less energy-hence-trees retain more carbon.
Mission: to re-imagine the approach to homebuilding and construction to make affordable, dignified housing available to everyone worldwide.
The quick cut: Icon is a 3D printer and robotics company trying to solve the affordability, sustainability, and availability issues driving the rampant housing crisis.
Using 3D printers to build homes takes less time and resources and results in less waste. Note: homes still use traditional construction methods for the roof, windows, and other finishes. Homes built thus far are primarily in Austin, TX, and Mexico, but the new iteration of 3D printers is designed to be used in more extreme weather conditions.
Mission: help improve stormwater infrastructure and water quality in our cities with permeable hardscape technology.
The quick cut: An environmental tech company out of Spokane, Washington, developed a patent on permeable concrete with less clogging and to help return your rain into the soil instead of running off-site and polluting your neighborhood. (Internal studies found that it consistently filtered more suspended solids than the EPA required threshold.) AquiPor material takes less energy and emits less CO2 than traditional concrete, accounting for 8% of global carbon emissions.
Mission: The Changeblock Protocol promotes liquidity, transparency, and trust in the climate markets by homogenizing carbon offsets and allowances into fungible ‘climate-backed-tonnes’; tradeable on the Changeblock Exchange.
Make sense? If you didn’t, you’re not alone. Blockchain is complicated.
Let us break it down in simple terms.
The semi quick cut: Companies use emission credit trading to help offset any fines or fees from climate change regulations. So, for example, an airline company can buy credits from a tree farm promising to plant over 400+ trees in the next year, and they use those credits to offset their company’s carbon emissions. It’s all a system of giving and taking to try and equal out the effects, but climate markets are messy, messy, messy. It’s confusing, has limited transparency and oversight, and someone needs to clean up the mess and make sure people are accountable. This is what Changeblock is trying to do by creating blockchain tokens that are secure assets used in the buying and selling process. It creates transparency, financial security, and accessibility for all stakeholders involved in climate markets.
OBVIOUSLY, we’re mentioning ourselves and not only out of marketing necessity. We firmly believe in our bold and unique approach to being the first stormwater marketplace for private property owners, and one space online for stormwater retrofit connections and resources.
Mission: Through our stormwater incentive database, financing, and Rainplan Builder, we knock down the barriers of cost and time management to make green infrastructure an accessible marketplace for anyone interested in green tech.
The quick cut: We’re the matchmaker making stormwater drainage infrastructure feasible for private property owners. Our Rainplan Builder helps establish your property project goals and educates you on benefits and incentive programs. We can help file incentive applications, find financing options, and connect you to vetted green infrastructure contractors.

36,https://myrainplan.com/impervious-surfaces-and-environmental-impact/,"The Property Owners Guide to Stormwater Utility Fees
As a property owner, you might notice additional fees on your monthly utility bill. Stormwater fees are a new charge in over 2000 cities across America. In some municipalities, these fees are minimal, around $5-9 dollars a month. You might not even see stormwater charges on your utility bill! These charges are far higher for commercial real estate properties, so many developers have started to look for solutions to offset these costs. Whether you are a residential property owner or own commercial property, stormwater management is an investment that will pay for itself over time. Plus, you’ll benefit from helping the environment and establishing your place as a sustainable solution. Let’s do the math on how you can offset your stormwater utility fees.
What is a stormwater utility fee?
Stormwater utility fees are a fee that the government charges for managing stormwater. They are usually calculated by the square foot of impervious surface. Impervious surfaces are where water rolls off and collects contaminants carried off into public spaces and waterways. They create pollution runoff and hurt water quality. Areas such as parking lots, driveways, and roofs are taxed to cover the cost of managing stormwater with filters, cleanups, pipes, and other infrastructure.
Stormwater utility bills are usually sent out quarterly or annually, depending on what type of plan your city has in place. Depending on your area, you might see these fees listed under property taxes, or for those of you in Pennsylvania; it’s called stormwater authority fees. Both tax and non-tax properties are required to pay these fees. These bills also include other services such as trash pick-up, snow removal, and recycling services.
Do I have stormwater management in my area?
If you don’t live near a significant watershed area or in a rural area, or most of your rain falls onto actual soil–you’ll likely never see a stormwater drainage bill. Stormwater management happens in urban and dense regions where growing development adds in additional hardscapes that contribute to water runoff. Cities that depend on local waterways like lakes, rivers, bays, and oceans will in the future (if they don’t already) have a stormwater drainage utility. Urbanization does not show any signs of stopping. For cities to upkeep stormwater and combined sewer systems, imposing a yearly fee is the only way to fund the future. Cities like Washington DC, Chicago, Detroit, and Philadelphia already have stormwater utilities. The EPA has programs to help local governments set up their utility system and you can read about it here.
How are Stormwater Charges Calculated
Commercial buildings take up more surface space and contribute to more water runoff than your typical residential home. If you happen to be a commercial property owner, you likely are getting charged more based on your concrete surfaces. Suppose you’re on residential property and have a pool, large patio or deck, or an accessory dwelling unit (like a separate garage or apartment). In that case, your stormwater fees will be higher.
The average stormwater fee in the United States is $12 billed quarterly, so around $48 a year for a residential property.
That’s a small amount of money per year; even over ten years, it’s not much, so why should I care?
Investing Wisely in Stormwater Management
Stormwater management is a significant issue in many cities. It can cost a lot of money to clean up the water and repair the damage that has been done. Green infrastructure is one solution that can save money and make things better for the environment. If private property owners all implemented some stormwater retention best practice, it would significantly help the local economy and save the neighborhood money in the long term. Plus, over time, any property owner who implements green infrastructure on their land will save money while helping to build a sustainable ecosystem and healthy environment.
Green infrastructure includes rain gardens, rain barrels, and other ways of collecting water runoff. The benefits of these green solutions are many: they are cheaper than traditional methods, are environmentally friendly, and can be used in conjunction with other stormwater management methods.
Example: If you live in Washington DC and have a small row home, your yearly charge for stormwater is likely around $50. Over ten years, you would have paid $500. However, if you purchase a rain barrel, your fees will be lowered, and the barrel itself is only $80. So you will have paid for the barrel within two years, and. Then be saving money for the next 8. Even better, through a stormwater incentive program, you can be reimbursed for the rain barrel making the entire retrofit a free project, and start saving instantly on stormwater utilities.
You can save thousands each year for commercial property owners after upgrading to a stormwater management practice like bioswales or permeable pavers. (If you add in a green roof, you save on utilities, energy bills, and more, thus maximizing your investment)
Stormwater Drainage Is a Long Game
The keen property owner knows that investing is a long game. You might not see the financial benefits immediately from installing green infrastructure-although you’ll see the maintenance benefits within the first rain event. Over time, you save money from purchasing and installing green infrastructure in your yard, parking lot, roof, etc. You’ll especially be able to save if you apply for a stormwater incentive program that will pay you back for your project costs.

37,https://myrainplan.com/maintenance-of-a-green-roof/,"Your Green Roof in Winter
You installed your green roof and with winter approaching you wonder what happens next. It might be tempting to walk away from it during the cold months and re-adjust come spring, but even green roofs need TLC during winter. Mike White of Connect Contracting writes more about caring for your new investment.
Green roof installation
Your green roof will make your life more comfortable and less costly during winter. It will be insulating your building against the cold. The vegetation will continue to absorb rainwater and any snowmelt. Plus, it will protect your roof against the natural elements that reduce lifespan.
On a typical extensive green roof, we plant perennial species that will die back in the winter and return in the spring. These plants are sedum varieties (like succulents) that hibernate and lie dormant in the winter months. What you may notice about your sedum roof though, is that it changes color in winter. While the foliage is vibrant during most of the year, in the winter the colors will fade. The colder the temperature, the more pronounced the winter colors will become. You may also notice a change in texture or the general appearance of the sedums. During the plant’s growing season, the foliage will appear full and lush. It’s because the succulents are storing water. Yet, a plant that stores water freezes over in cold temperatures which damages its cell walls. In winter, plants need to keep less water in their cells.
Green roof safety
A green roof is no place to be in the winter. At this point of the year, routine maintenance and winterization should be complete. Below is a list of maintenance tasks to prepare for. Before doing so, please consider the safety hazards of winter roof work, and consider hiring a green roof professional. If you must walk on the roof, avoid stepping on the plants as best you can. Most green roof plants are resilient enough to walk through and step on. Still, as they lie dormant, they are less likely to bounce back in the spring if damaged.
Green roof maintenance tasks
- Keep gutters and drainage outlets free of debris. If the water is unable to discharge from the roof, it could cause damage in freezing conditions.
- Remove debris from the roof as that debris will deprive the plants of sunlight. You can complete this at the beginning of the spring if you feel more comfortable getting on the roof then.
- In special cases, you might consider wind protection. Green roofs with a large amount of bare growth media could be at risk of blowing off the roof. Properly established green roof media should pack in tight and the lighter organic material will have already filtered below the surface.
Stormwater drainage
There are several ways to water your green roof throughout the year, but you should drain irrigation systems before freezing conditions. In an extensive green roof, typically a drip irrigation system is installed within the growth media or above the finished grade. All irrigation systems are set up with similar components. They will likely be comprised of a programmable timer, electronic valves, drip line, or solid piping with pop-up heads.
If the green roof is under a service or maintenance contract, the winterization should be scheduled during the last visit of the year. We recommend having a contract set up in place to guarantee all pipes and drips are taken care of. Although, if you prefer DIY, you as the homeowner can take a few simple steps:
- Detach the timer or piping from the hose bib to allow for initial drainage. If the timer/valve is attached directly to the hose bib, it should be removed from the hose bib and piping. In other words, it should be stopped for the winter. If there are many valves, they should all be detached or manually opened.
- In most cases, the step above will not entirely drain the system. If it is a “drip” system, the remaining water can be drained by opening the kinked ends of the lines. These lines may be marked or “daylit” by the installing green roof contractor and require you to access the roof.
- However, if the homeowner is equipped with the tools, it is preferable to use a compressor to blow out the lines. Connecting a compressor on the ground to the valve(s) or the piping is the most efficient and effective way to perform this task.
If the irrigation system is a pop-up sprinkler system, then a compressor is required to blow out the lines. In this case, it is recommended that a green roof professional is sought out to complete the work, as the pop-up systems tend to be more intricate.
Rooftop lawn checklist
If you walk away from this article unclear about irrigation systems and drip lines, we at least hope that this quick summary of what you as a property owner should consider helps you in your process. If you don’t have the time or feel confused about what needs to be done, talk to your green roof installer to set up a maintenance package and have them send you a list of items they will accomplish before the last check-in before winter.
- Clean up your green roof in the fall to prepare it for winter. Remove debris and check bare areas of the roof.
- Most importantly be sure to rid your roof of dripping water, and don’t overwater before a freeze. You want a dry roof and dry plants for most of the winter months.

Permeable Paver FAQ
Frequently Asked
What is a permeable paver?
Permeable pavers, also known as permeable interlocking concrete pavements (PICP), are installed with layers of varying-sized stone or aggregate underneath that filter and direct stormwater to underground aquifers. With permeable concrete pavers, any rain that falls on your patio, walkway, or driveway seeps back into the ground, reducing the burden on storm drains and preventing flooding.
Where can I use permeable pavement?
Everything depends on your soil type and levels, but most pavers can be used as a traditional replacement for any project, such as patios, swimming pool areas, driveways, walkways etc.
What are the steps of the rainplan process?
Once you submit your address we will send you a Rainplan assessment that will include an analysis on your property, what type of technologies we recommend, the amount of government funding you’re eligible for, and a pricing estimate.
Afterwards we send a contractor or engineer to your property depending on the type of upgrade you’re looking to do. A structural engineer will evaluate the structural integrity of your property for a Green Roof, and a landscape designer will conduct a percolation test on your soil and the design for the installation on your soil for permeable pavers and rain gardens.
We’ll then send you finalized pricing and if you accept we will submit your property for incentive approval and afterwards begin the installation process.
Do permeable pavers require maintenance?
Technically all pavement (permeable or standard concrete) requires some type of maintenance to keep it from cracking. Especially if you live in colder climates. Permeable pavers require cleaning like standard concrete pathways. Since they are porous, they need to be washed out to get debris out of the material every year.
Is Rainplan a contractor?
No, we match you with the best contractors in your area and help you navigate the installation process.
What is the homeowner responsible for?
In addition to the installation fee, the property owner is responsible for:
A- Providing Rainplan with access to the property throughout the installation process.
B- Assigning payment to Rainplan of any stormwater installation rebates.
C- Annual maintenance of stormwater improvements to ensure property owner remains eligible for annual utility fee discounts.
D- Any property damage. Stormwater upgrades are designed to capture the first 1.2 inches of rainfall and Rainplan does not guarantee protection from severe weather, and or other property related events.
What type of technologies does Rainplan offer?
Green Roofs, Permeable Pavers, Rain Gardens, Rain Barrels
How does Rainplan work with the government?
Yes, Rain Plan is a for-profit, private organization. We have no contractual or affiliation with the government. We provide storm water services where we assess the property, connect to installers and fund the work so there’s no out-of-pocket cost for the property owners.
We administer the application process into the local jurisdictions for the programs. For example; In DC they have numerous programs, one of them is the River Smart Rewards Program and the Chesapeake Bay Trust.
We have no affiliation but we provide a service to make it easier for property owners to make upgrades but also obtain incentives from the government.

General Questions About Permeable Pavers
What is Permeable Pavement?
Permeable pavers allow rain and snow to soak into the ground with porous materials and specific designs.
The beautiful designs are not only for looks but serve a purpose—water is able to reach the ground in between the spaces of individual pavers. A standard concrete driveway forces water to flow over it and around it, leading to flooding, erosion, and runoff.
Permeable pavers limit runoff at the source, reduce downstream erosion and improve our water quality. This makes the rainwater soak through instead of running off and into the street. There’s an underdrain that goes underneath it.
What are the benefits of permeable pavers?
- Extend the life of your driveway. Permeable Pavers are 4x stronger than concrete
- Enhance curb appeal and increase your property’s value
- Help you retain and redirect rainfall, preventing floods
Where would I install permeable pavement on my property?
Most of the time, if you take a survey of your land (look around) and consider the hardscapes (walkways, driveways, patios, etc.) these are the places where improving permeability could be a desirable solution. The most convenient time is when you start to notice these hardscapes breaking down due to the elements, or when you notice things like breakthrough moisture in your basement.
As a caveat, every property is unique and has its own stormwater story. So sometimes, permeable pavement can solve for stormwater drainage issues that aren’t due to the failure (or success) of existing hardscapes. The best way to understand the feasibility of stormwater on your land is to use our free tool, which will help you choose the right technologies for your land.

What properties are a good fit for permeable pavers?
Permeable pavement works well on driveways and walkways that have:
- Flat areas with less than a two percent slope (Two-foot drop in elevation for every 100 feet)
- Soil with a high infiltration rate (Allows water that is temporarily stored in the pavement to soak into the ground.)
- Little tree cover (Tree roots or overhanging tree canopy can negatively impact the pavement)
- Small spaces (Many stormwater features require a large footprint)
What kind of Maintenance is required for permeable pavers?
They are known for easy repairs and low maintenance. When concrete cracks and needs fixing, repairs can be costly. Alternatively, permeable pavers are easy to repair because it can happen one stone at a time. Permeable pavers also require 0% to 25% of the salt application of conventional materials in the winter months.
How do Permeable Pavers Look?
Should I replace my concrete driveway?
Concrete driveways are not pervious. This causes rainwater to flow off the driveway rather than into the ground. Removing this pavement creates less stormwater runoff, which is better for our streams. Permeable pavement spreads out stormwater, soaks it into the ground, and slows it down.
- Remove impervious surfaces such as asphalt and concrete
- Prepare the ground to install native plants, permeable pavement and rain gardens
- Help you retain and redirect rainfall, preventing floods
Are there minimum requirements in order to qualify for an Incentive?
Each incentive program is different and has its own unique standards and requirements based on the local government or region offering the incentive. Some programs will require a minimum project size of your rain garden or permeable pavers, some may require a minimum of impervious area to be treated. It varies from incentive program to incentive program.
Rainplan helps you discover what incentive programs your property is eligible for and understand the program’s specific requirements to ensure you maximize and receive your benefits!
How long do Permeable Pavers last?
Permeable Pavers are up to four times stronger than concrete and last two times longer than traditional driveways. Permeable pavers have joints which make it flexible and durable as the ground changes. Unlike concrete paveways, it won’t crack when there is an earthquake or when the ground beneath contracts and expands.
How much do permeable pavers cost?
Permeable pavers on average cost $35 per square foot including both the material and installation cost. In most jurisdictions permeable packers are eligible for $10-$15 in incentives which brings down the out of pocket cost to $20-$25 per square foot.
What’s the incentive breakdown For Permeable Pavers?
MS4- The government incentive will give you a rebate of up to $3 per sqf with a $4000 cap on all properties.
MGC- The government incentive will give you a rebate of up to $14 per sqf with a $7500 cap on residential properties and a $20,000 cap on Commercial Properties.
PGC- The government incentive will give you a rebate of up to $9 per sqf with a $4000 cap on residential properties and a $20,000 cap on Commercial Properties..
CSS- There are currently no active incentive programs for Permeable Pavers in the CSS area.
How do permeable paver affect my local water supply?
Permeable pavers reduce stormwater runoff and filtrate water that runs through them which means cleaner water soaks into the ground. When water travels downwards through the varying layers, it is filtered, removing pollutants that would have otherwise entered our local water systems. The slow filtration also cools down the water which puts less pressure on our water systems.
Are there minimum requirements in order to qualify for an Incentive?
Each incentive program is different and has its own unique standards and requirements based on the local government or region offering the incentive. Some programs will require a minimum project size of your rain garden or permeable pavers, some may require a minimum of impervious area to be treated. It varies from incentive program to incentive program. Rainplan helps you discover what incentive programs your property is eligible for and understand the program’s specific requirements to ensure you maximize and receive your benefits!
What is impervious surface and what happens when it is treated?
An impervious surface is one that does not allow water to soak through. Examples include roofs, sidewalks, driveways, parking lots, patios, roadways…
There are several ways to retrofit or treat the runoff from impervious surfaces. Improvements can be made as simple as installing a vegetative buffer strip around the perimeter of a designated area, installing a tree island in a parking area; installing permeable concrete, permeable brick and concrete pavers; or permeable asphalt.
Let Rainplan help you discover incentives and technologies to best treat your impervious surfaces!
What are impervious surfaces?
Impervious surfaces are surfaces that do not allow water to pass through them. On your property, these can be driveways, patios, sidewalks, parking areas and rooftops. Since water cannot go through these surfaces, it travels over them and picks up pollutants along the way which creates an environmental burden on our local waterways. Did you know that municipalities across the country charge property owners an annual fee for the amount of impervious surface on your property? Replacing impervious surfaces with pervious surfaces like permeable pavers can reduce this annual government fee and come with added benefits.
What does my ""soil classification"" mean?
The soil classification from A through D indicates the permeability (how fast water is absorbed) of your soils. “A” soils have high permeability, while “D” soils have low permeability. In urban environments, you can have more than one soil classification on your property. The “soil classification” is the reported soils for your property either from the USGS national database or your local government’s GIS data about your property. Regardless the permeability of your soil must be tested and confirmed through a “percolation test” in order to determine if your soils are adequate or require additional design enhancements like an underdrain or soil amendment.
Let Rainplan help you find a contractor to perform a percolation test as part of their price proposal!

How Amy Butler’s Green Roof is Changing Her Neighborhood
- Client: Amy Butler
- Project: Residential Green Roof
- Geographic Area: Washington DC Metro Area
“You know there’s Gladys on the corner, and she knows everything about everyone. The first time I wore my collar out the front door…everyone knew what I did for a living”.
Over half a million people live in Washington, DC, yet each ward in the city feels like a small town. Just ask Amy Butler, a resident of Ward 5 in the Queens Chapel neighborhood, whose job as a pastor naturally lends itself to community building in the area.
“This was one of the first planned developments in DC. Most of my neighbors are in their 80s or 90s, and they tell me if you want to do a block party, you have to organize it”, says Butler. “Douglas is my next-door neighbor, and he’s 94, and he likes to garden. He’s always asking if he can clean up my alley, and I bake him cookies. It’s a cute thing”.
Butler is a force for understanding the dynamics of people living collectively together.
“I love to garden, but I lived in Manhattan the past decade, so I haven’t had space, but it’s one of the reasons I love being here,” states Butler. “I can have a little garden patch in the back. You know, tomatoes, zucchinis, and jalapeños”.
After New York City, Butler initially moved to a Maryland neighborhood known for progressive environmental incentives.
“I lived in a cohousing community in Takoma Park, and we had a green roof there, so I was very familiar with what it looks like,” says Butler.
In her new community of Queens Chapel, Butler took a few of her prior experiences and decided to add a green roof to her new home.
“When I moved into this house, I did major remodeling. I had to renovate everything, and I was thinking about doing a green roof although it wasn’t leaking or anything”, reports Butler. “I just thought as long as I’m doing all this, I should take care of it. The roof was like 70 years old”.
After being referred by a DC group, Butler came to Rainplan with ideas for a green roof garden on her flat roof home-a a popular style for the area.
“It turns out my roof is perfect for a green roof. I like it. Not only has it already changed the temperature inside the house, but it also says to my neighbors that I care about the earth”, says Butler. “It shows my values.”
It took around four months for installation to fit a green roof onto Butler’s home. With cooperation from DC programs, architects, and Rainplan, the project became affordable and easily adjusted to her already in motion renovations.
“I can’t even imagine a person going to the DC government and filing for an incentive. Rainplan is like the person who holds your hand through the whole process. Everyone I’ve met has been delightful to work with”, states Butler.
Green roofs are a popular choice among residents and business complexes with flat roofs in the DC area. A green roof can weigh less than a standard shingled, lasts twice as long, and has increased property resale value.
“I think people need to see it,” shares Butler. “I feel like this neighborhood is prime potential for Rainplan because all houses and the roofs are flat. So there has to be a way to let people know what the options are”.
For now, Butler looks forward to the future possibilities for her new space and caring for her new green roof garden.
“It’s the joke of the neighborhood. ‘Oh, Amy’s watering her roof.’ I try to water once or twice a week”, quips Butler.
“My partner Ryan went up there once to weed, which was funny because he was Face Timing me and asking, “Is this a weed? Is this a weed?”. Together, we are figuring out how to take care of it”.
With incentive funding, expedited processing with contractors, and someone there to guide you throughout the process, Rainplan can help take a vision and turn it into something achievable. Sure Butler is an ambitious go-getter with experience in mobilizing communities and making things happen. However, even the most ambitious of us still need help in navigating the complex government incentive process.
“I would like to do permeable pavers in my back patio area when the timing is right. I had such a positive experience with the incentive system that I was like, ‘why not do something else?’ I would love to work with rainplan again”.",amy dc green roof amy butler green roof changing neighborhood client amy butler project residential green roof geographic area washington dc metro area know gladys corner knows everything everyone first time wore collar front door everyone knew living half million people live washington dc yet ward city feels like small town ask amy butler resident ward queens chapel neighborhood whose job pastor naturally lends community building area one first planned developments dc neighbors 80s 90s tell want block party organize says butler douglas next door neighbor likes garden always asking clean alley bake cookies cute thing butler force understanding dynamics people living collectively together love garden lived manhattan past decade space one reasons love states butler little garden patch back know tomatoes zucchinis jalapenos new york city butler initially moved maryland neighborhood known progressive environmental incentives lived cohousing community takoma park green roof familiar looks like says butler new community queens chapel butler took prior experiences decided add green roof new home moved house major remodeling renovate everything thinking green roof although leaking anything reports butler thought long take care roof like years old referred dc group butler came rainplan ideas green roof garden flat roof home popular style area turns roof perfect green roof like already changed temperature inside house also says neighbors care earth says butler shows values took around four months installation fit green roof onto butler home cooperation dc programs architects rainplan project became affordable easily adjusted already motion renovations even imagine person going dc government filing incentive rainplan like person holds hand whole process everyone met delightful work states butler green roofs popular choice among residents business complexes flat roofs dc area green roof weigh less standard shingled lasts twice long increased property resale value think people need see shares butler feel like neighborhood prime potential rainplan houses roofs flat way let people know options butler looks forward future possibilities new space caring new green roof garden joke neighborhood oh amy watering roof try water twice week quips butler partner ryan went weed funny face timing asking weed weed together figuring take care incentive funding expedited processing contractors someone guide throughout process rainplan help take vision turn something achievable sure butler ambitious go getter experience mobilizing communities making things happen however even ambitious us still need help navigating complex government incentive process would like permeable pavers back patio area timing right positive experience incentive system like something else would love work rainplan
43,https://myrainplan.com/project/dc-yellow-cab-company/,"Matched Incentive Program(s):(1) Stormwater Retention Credit Program SRC (2) Riverwise Credit Program
Property Location:1336 Bladensburg Ave. Washington, DC 20002
Property Owner (Host): Yellow Enterprises, LLC
Aggregator (Producer):Greening Urban
Overview
Rain is the single largest cause of water pollution, flooding, and property damage impacting over 200 million people in the US today.This has led to federal mandates that put pressure on local governments and private property owners. Local governments only have access to 20% of the land use in a given urban market, requiring them to come up with ways to incentivize private property owners to retrofit their properties. While incentive programs exist they are hard to find, complicated, and time-consuming which leads to extremely low utilization rates.
Using Rainplan, Yellow Enterprises located at 1336 Bladensburg Ave Washington, DC 20002 was able to benefit from local incentives available to property owners within the City to upgrade their parking lot with a bio-retention “rain garden” facility that treats approximately 39K gallons of water per the first inch of rain. Rainplan matched Yellow Enterprises with (2) incentive programs for a total value of $115+K. Yellow Enterprise’s participation didn’t require any out-of-pocket expenditures or construction delivery risk. The only requirement of Yellow Enterprises as the “Host” for the green infrastructure improvement was to allow property access for the installation and long-term maintenance of the installed rain garden.
Greening Urban is a local, DC-based, design, engineering, and construction management firm led by Chris Early that was matched by Rainplan to this project as the “Producer.” As the Producer, Greening Urban is responsible for the installation, certification, and maintenance of the installed green infrastructure device to ensure it is within compliance and functionality of the local incentive programs requirements. Through the Rainplan platform, Greening Urban was successful in sourcing the upfront funding to proceed with the installation and management of the installed infrastructure.
Approach
There’s a general proactive lack of participation with stormwater management by private property owners and a need for digitization of available incentive programs offered by incentive providers. Private Property Owners are unaware of the incentives, value, and benefits of optimal stormwater management on their properties.
The lack of awareness around available incentives, and the impact of stormwater compliance on private property ownership involves highly complicated technologies, non-digitized incentive application processes, and 180 day incentive payout periods that are significant barriers to increasing private property owners’ participation with local stormwater retrofits.
Rainplan’s objective is to digitize the available incentive programs into one single consolidated platform and match those incentives to the private properties to create high impact stormwater projects that increase value for private property owners, increase the utilization of available incentive programs, and ultimately improve the local water quality and flooding impacts in highly urban communities.
Results
Matched (2) incentive programs
$115K in tangible value to the property owner.
Sourced $310k in funding for design and construction
~40K gallons of stormwater treatment capacity through green infrastructure.
Conclusion
Rainplan is an incentive-matching marketplace that unlocks the full environmental and economic value of stormwater on private property. Our goal is to have all property owners and/or owner agents utilize Rainplan to optimize their stormwater planning to achieve the maximum economic value for property owners balanced with the maximum environmental ROI for incentive providers, all while streamlining the process for engineering and construction professionals to add more value to their clients and increasing their volume of local stormwater projects.",matched incentive program stormwater retention credit program src riverwise credit program property location bladensburg ave washington dc property owner host yellow enterprises llc aggregator producer greening urban overview rain single largest cause water pollution flooding property damage impacting million people us today led federal mandates put pressure local governments private property owners local governments access land use given urban market requiring come ways incentivize private property owners retrofit properties incentive programs exist hard find complicated time consuming leads extremely low utilization rates using rainplan yellow enterprises located bladensburg ave washington dc able benefit local incentives available property owners within city upgrade parking lot bio retention rain garden facility treats approximately 39k gallons water per first inch rain rainplan matched yellow enterprises incentive programs total value k yellow enterprise participation require pocket expenditures construction delivery risk requirement yellow enterprises host green infrastructure improvement allow property access installation long term maintenance installed rain garden greening urban local dc based design engineering construction management firm led chris early matched rainplan project producer producer greening urban responsible installation certification maintenance installed green infrastructure device ensure within compliance functionality local incentive programs requirements rainplan platform greening urban successful sourcing upfront funding proceed installation management installed infrastructure approach general proactive lack participation stormwater management private property owners need digitization available incentive programs offered incentive providers private property owners unaware incentives value benefits optimal stormwater management properties lack awareness around available incentives impact stormwater compliance private property ownership involves highly complicated technologies non digitized incentive application processes day incentive payout periods significant barriers increasing private property owners participation local stormwater retrofits rainplan objective digitize available incentive programs one single consolidated platform match incentives private properties create high impact stormwater projects increase value private property owners increase utilization available incentive programs ultimately improve local water quality flooding impacts highly urban communities results matched incentive programs 115k tangible value property owner sourced 310k funding design construction 40k gallons stormwater treatment capacity green infrastructure conclusion rainplan incentive matching marketplace unlocks full environmental economic value stormwater private property goal property owners owner agents utilize rainplan optimize stormwater planning achieve maximum economic value property owners balanced maximum environmental roi incentive providers streamlining process engineering construction professionals add value clients increasing volume local stormwater projects

- Client: Shelley and David Moskowitz
- Project: Residential Green Roof
- Geographic Area: Washington DC Metro Area
How She Describes Rainplan:
“A streamlined way to be able to install a green roof garden and to be able to both improve the property and be environmentally considerate. Doing something good for the community and doing something good for our own home. Rainplan makes it easier to act on our own values and be able to accomplish the goal of a healthy sustainable community.”
At some point we have all been to a public library. For those of us who frequent the library, there is a solid understanding of being inundated with flyers on cork boards and signage about events, services, or partnerships. While most of use apps or groups online now, walking into a public library is the physical manifestation of walking into the community Craigslist page. It’s a lot to take in, but for the observant, it’s a treasure trove of resources. And if the public library is the community treasure chest, then Shelley Moskowitz could be considered its premiere pirate.
“I remember seeing a sign at the library that indicated that there was a rain garden that had been set up by RiverSmart”, states Moskowitz. “I get a lot of my information from the library”.
RiverSmart is the DOEE’s (DC’s department of Energy and Environment) best not-so-secret- anymore program. Numerous property owners have utilized program resources in the past.
“I remember looking for it online, finding it, putting our name on the list, and then I don’t remember hearing anything”, says Moskowitz. “There seemed to be a long waiting list. It always stayed in the back of my mind that that would be a cool thing to explore and possibly do. So I put our name back on the list about four years ago and they responded and I didn’t let the ball drop this time.”
Working with RiverSmart, Shelley and her husband David installed two rain gardens in their yard, planted a few trees, and added in two rain barrels to collect water runoff from their roof. Rain gardens and rain barrels are popular stormwater bmp (best management practices) in the DC area. For one, DC has just the right amount of precipitation each year to make rain harvesting a viable environmental hobby. Two, in the DC region, residents are well aware of the MS4 combined sewer system and its effects on the Anacostia and Potomac water ways.
DC’s direct economical engagement and proximity to these waterways has led to regulation, utility fees, and more when it comes to protecting the local waters from pollution. Stormwater has become enemy #1 in the region, as cities continue to boom and water runoff continues to carry oils, chemicals, and bacteria over hardscapes and into rivers and streams.
“We were aware that the DC government is supportive of creating environmental incentives and we went through that process with RiverSmart”, says Moskowitz. “Rainplan was another piece of it but even better with the help and support of the team to do all the steps”.
Utilizing local resources and incentive programs is what Moskowitz seemingly does best. This makes sense considering her time spent volunteering at the East Rock Creek Village-a senior center dedicated to helping the aging in the area-and her job as the founder of her own consulting firm focusing on coaching nonprofit boards and the like. Plus both Shelly and David Moskowitz went to Tulane and were politically active in the environmental movement.
“Being rooted where we live, that’s a very high value for us”, states Moskowitz. “Also since we now have our own business, we don’t always have consistent income so we do look for ways to improve the property smartly and make our own contribution to the community by doing these green things that fit into our values and our priorities”.
After discovering Rainplan the Moskowitz’s decided to update their roof and turn it into a green roof- a roof compiled of different casing and sediment to make it possible for someone to plant small succulents or grasses on top of their home.
“I saw a FB ad about Rainplan. So that’s what I clicked on it and was like ‘Oh this looks like a streamlined way to explore the process and see if we qualify’, says Moskowitz.
The Moskowitz family installed a small green roof on the side of their home, covering a 216 sq. ft area and enough space to plant a small succulent garden.
“With the green roof I am so happy to go up on the roof particularly around sunset-and in DC you don’t get up high very often”, says Moskowitz. “Yet here we are and there’s nothing that blocks the way and you can see the most amazing sunsets and it makes me so happy.”",shelley resourcefulness got green roof client shelley david moskowitz project residential green roof geographic area washington dc metro area describes rainplan streamlined way able install green roof garden able improve property environmentally considerate something good community something good home rainplan makes easier act values able accomplish goal healthy sustainable community point public library us frequent library solid understanding inundated flyers cork boards signage events services partnerships use apps groups online walking public library physical manifestation walking community craigslist page lot take observant treasure trove resources public library community treasure chest shelley moskowitz could considered premiere pirate remember seeing sign library indicated rain garden set riversmart states moskowitz get lot information library riversmart doee dc department energy environment best secret anymore program numerous property owners utilized program resources past remember looking online finding putting name list remember hearing anything says moskowitz seemed long waiting list always stayed back mind would cool thing explore possibly put name back list four years ago responded let ball drop time working riversmart shelley husband david installed two rain gardens yard planted trees added two rain barrels collect water runoff roof rain gardens rain barrels popular stormwater bmp best management practices dc area one dc right amount precipitation year make rain harvesting viable environmental hobby two dc region residents well aware ms4 combined sewer system effects anacostia potomac water ways dc direct economical engagement proximity waterways led regulation utility fees comes protecting local waters pollution stormwater become enemy region cities continue boom water runoff continues carry oils chemicals bacteria hardscapes rivers streams aware dc government supportive creating environmental incentives went process riversmart says moskowitz rainplan another piece even better help support team steps utilizing local resources incentive programs moskowitz seemingly best makes sense considering time spent volunteering east rock creek village senior center dedicated helping aging area job founder consulting firm focusing coaching nonprofit boards like plus shelly david moskowitz went tulane politically active environmental movement rooted live high value us states moskowitz also since business always consistent income look ways improve property smartly make contribution community green things fit values priorities discovering rainplan moskowitz decided update roof turn green roof roof compiled different casing sediment make possible someone plant small succulents grasses top home saw fb ad rainplan clicked like oh looks like streamlined way explore process see qualify says moskowitz moskowitz family installed small green roof side home covering sq ft area enough space plant small succulent garden green roof happy go roof particularly around sunset dc get high often says moskowitz yet nothing blocks way see amazing sunsets makes happy
45,https://myrainplan.com/project/tom-bulgers-rain-garden/,"How Tom Bulger Took Advantage of Rain Garden Incentives
Client: Tom Bulger
Project: Rain Garden
Geographic Area: Washington DC Metro Area
A conversation about environmental gravitas ends in a story about fraternity brothers returning a cadaver to a hospital before dawn. Thus is the intro to the wild ride that is Tom Bulger.
Mr. Bulger is a man whose resume carries a lot of prestige. He has been a Federal lobbyist for many years.
He serves on the board of WMATA (Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority), and he is the reason many counties received funding under initiatives like the Clean Water Act. Plus, he was the policy advisor to one of the most influential federal transportation commissions since the Clay Commission of the 1950s (which conceptualized and created the federal highway system).
Bulger is accomplished, yet humble, a man that even with his schedule still manages to make it to many West Virginia University (WVU) football games.
With an environmental policy and transportation background, it is not so surprising that Bulger and his wife are early adopters to stormwater management.
“The biggest motivational factor for my wife and me was the Chesapeake Bay Alliance,” says Bulger. “We have a connection there, and we’re fortunate enough to have a boat on the bay 7-9 months out of the year.”
Team Bulger are active participants in and around the Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the United States.
“We’re very involved in our marina in Eastport, Maryland. “But now I don’t go in the water anymore. After a big rainstorm or hurricane, you can even see a big plume in the Bay from space that depicts the pollution. People get infections.”
There are also economic concerns with the Bay’s water quality influencing local markets and restaurants.
“Crabs are scarce. Prices have tripled because the bay is dying in some places-the grass on the floor of the bay can’t hide the crabs”, says Bulger. “So there’s no place for the crabs to hide, and fish are eating and depleting the source.”
Concerns over economic and environmental impact, plus a desire to give his wife another area to garden in, led to Bulger contacting Rainplan to help him put in a rain garden on his property. A rain garden is a shallow dip in the ground with vegetation explicitly planted to help pull water back into the earth before running off into streets and drains.
“The long and short of it is that my wife has another garden. The idea that Rainplan would be our concierge and that they were working with Casey Trees, we were attracted by that,” says Bulger. (Casey Trees is a Washington DC-area nonprofit dedicated to restoring tree canopies and partners in completing rain gardens in the area).
Due to added curb appeal and comparatively easy installation, rain gardens have become a popular choice for water-conscious property owners. Yet, many property owners are either unaware of available incentives or the process of filing an application and finding the right contractor to complete the work is overwhelming.
“I had all of our neighbors come over to see our rain garden,” says Bulger. “I told them how inexpensive it was because we received $2,200 from the Bay Alliance [as an incentive package]. It was a no-brainer. It only cost us $700.”
Rainplan’s job is to make sure all incentive applications are filed and appropriate funding is offered, plus they find vetted contractors in the area to come place bids on the project—matching the owner to the best possible price. Essentially a one-stop spot for getting a stormwater project funded and completed.
“There’s so much on the internet now. So many emails and you don’t know what’s too good to be true,” says Bulger. “Rainplan does seem too good to be true, but I can’t say enough about it.”
With a rain garden installed on his property, Bulger can offset soil erosion that drains into a nearby creek-which then drains into the Chesapeake Bay. A simple step in addition to the work the Bulger family already does to protect their neighborhood’s environment.
“The rain garden came out wonderfully and it’s a really big addition. It makes the backyard look better and we aren’t losing our grass to erosion,” states Bulger. “Every little bit helps. There are a lot of young families in the Chevy Chase area, we’re surrounded by little kids and I know they get some curriculum in school about how the Bay impacts their lives.”
Over 150 rivers stream into the Chesapeake drainage basin. It’s home to archaeological sites such as shipwrecked canoes–it’s a piece of American history that also directly connects the economies of 6 neighboring states (New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, District of Columbia, and West Virginia).
Protecting the bay from landscape drainage is critical in preserving the livelihoods of these areas. Even small steps like a rain garden on Bulger’s gorgeous property can have a huge collective impact on the Bay’s watershed.

47,https://myrainplan.com/rain-barrel-ideas-for-summer/,"Did you come to this post looking for rain barrel ideas and information? You’re not alone! With summer technically just starting and the heat index in many areas hitting record highs, many property owners are thinking of creative ways to maintain their yards or keep their soils drought resistant. Using rainwater is one of the best ways to maximize Mother Nature, plus a great utility savings hack.
With Rainplan, we often have people asking if we can find them rain barrel discounts or federal tax credits for rainwater harvesting. The answer? Absolutely yes. In most cities, rainwater or residential cisterns have a stormwater incentive attached to them. There’s a misconception that collecting rainwater is illegal in some states, and that’s simply not true. Each city has specific mandates about what material you can use to collect rainwater, what size of rain barrel you can install, and how many gallons you can collect during each rain event. It’s not illegal in states, there is only some fine print you need to read first. Let’s break down some rain barrel ideas and concepts like: rain barrel uses, benefits of a rain barrel, rain barrel mosquito prevention, how to use a rain barrel, and drip irrigation from a rain barrel.
Benefits of a Rain Barrel
If this isn’t your first time on our blog, you have likely seen many posts about the benefits of rain barrels. Or posts about residential cisterns. However, to recap the benefits of rain barrels:
- Save money on your water bills.
- Store and keep your watering schedule consistent during droughts.
- Prevent water runoff from your yard and help with neighborhood water pollution.
- You can also save on stormwater fees in some areas by installing a rainwater capture system.
Rain Barrel Uses
To break the benefits even further, let’s discuss rain barrel uses. The most obvious is that you are, of course, capturing water to store and use rainwater during times of drought. You can take this advantage even further and install different systems to help monitor and water your property throughout the year. For example…
Drip Irrigation from a Rain Barrel
Drip irrigation is a rigged watering system that uses small amounts of water to slowly drip water to the roots of plants. These systems can be built underground or on top of the soil, but either option is a water conservation technique that consistently maintains soil moisture. Not only are drip irrigation systems suitable for water usage, but they also prevent overwatering, and damaging leaves and growing weeds, and they decrease maintenance.
When drip irrigating from a rain barrel, you are doubling down on reusing water and conserving water usage on your property. Drip irrigation from a rain barrel is often called a gravity drip system because you are not relying on setting up a pressurized watering system. You let gravity move the water from your rain barrel and down into the pipes watering your plants. You can read more about how to set up a rain barrel drip irrigation system here.
How to Use a Rain Barrel
Like many things in life, you must do a little prep work before installing and correctly using your rain barrel. Things to consider before you go out and purchase a rainwater capture system or a residential cistern.
- For a federal tax credit for rainwater harvesting, you will want to read the fine print of your municipal city codes and the incentive program to manage your paperwork. Each city has different “rules” for how large your rain barrel is, the material it is made of, and how and where it is installed for you to get a rain barrel rebate.
- You usually need to purchase a rain barrel and have it connected to a roof downspout before you can apply for a rain barrel rebate. Wondering what rebate programs are offered for your property? That’s what we do! Use our search engine to find incentive programs in your area.
- Depending on where you live, the material of your rain barrel matters. For example, while the least expensive, plastic barrels can easily crack in cold weather climates unless you keep a careful eye on them.
- Speaking of cracking, know that with a rain barrel, maintenance is involved. You need to disconnect your barrel from the downspout every winter, dry it out, and store it so you can protect the material, and water won’t get in it and freeze over.
- Once you have done your research on materials and maintenance, the next step is ordering a barrel-whether from an online store or directly from your municipal government.
- To install, we recommend watching this handy installation guide. If you are doing an underground cistern system, that’s a whole other ball game and will require a professional to help with that installation.
Rain Barrel Mosquito Prevention
A common concern is creating environments for mosquitos and other water bugs with rain barrels. Mosquito larvae are one reason why many cities used to ban the use of rain barrels over a specific size and area. The key, however, is that with modern design updates and proper care, your rain barrel won’t be a breeding ground for pesky insects. For rain barrel mosquito prevention, keep these few things in mind:
- You can order rain barrels with built-in mosquito screens that keep bugs away from the water source. Do not install your own screen system until you research the type of netting and screen you need to keep these bugs out.
- Keep your intake opening (where the downspout and your rain barrel’s hole meet) covered with a screen and tightly sealed. Some people recommend using a double layer for the screen.
- Ensure your overflow port (a knob in the middle of the barrel that you can open and close to during heavy rainfall) is closed when you are not using it.
- Keep your outflow valve (the spout where water flows out of the barrel and is usually located towards the bottom) turned off when not in use, and put small screens around the opening to deter bugs.
- If you suspect mosquito larvae have already started forming inside the barrel, you must empty the barrel, completely dry it out, redo your screens and check for faulty valves.
- Most importantly, don’t let water stand in your barrel for too long, or if you have a barrel with decorative tops, don’t let water pool in these areas.
Creative Mosquito Prevention in Rain Barrels
The above is a sure way to keep mosquitos out of your rain barrel, but if you are looking for even more creative ways to prevent mosquitos in your yard, here are a few suggestions.
- Put some vegetable oil in your rain barrel. The oil suffocates mosquitos when they try to land. You need to put a 1.4 cup of oil each week in the barrel, however, to maintain this.
- Mosquito dunks are one way to keep mosquitos out. You purchase these tablets made of safe bacteria (even safe for beneficial insects like bees and butterflies) and dissolve them in your rain barrel. Make sure you get tablets specifically made for ponds.
- Goldfish. A crazy idea and likely not the best option for most people, but if your rain barrel is in a mild climate and out of direct sunlight, goldfish will eat your mosquitos for you. Of course, you must bring them inside before winter; some might feel like keeping fish in the dark tank is rude.
What’s a Residential Cistern
For those looking to go full-on with your rainwater collection, and if you live in areas with heavy rain or have a large roof area (such as a business park, etc.), a residential cistern might be best for you. Cisterns collect more water per gallon than a rain barrel and require a professional to come out and help set it up due to size. Some people opt for smaller cisterns above ground, and others are more inclined to bury their system and keep it underground.
Rain barrels, on average, hold up to 55 gallons of water, whereas a cistern can hold on average 20,000 gallons.
The benefits of a cistern over a rain barrel are that you can water more areas with a cistern, collect more rain, are pressurized systems, so you have more control of where and how you water, pulse they require less yearly maintenance since they are not prone to cracking in winter months. They are usually made of stainless steel, although you can get them in plastics too. Another benefit is that for some cistern systems, you can integrate it into your try water usage. For example, connect it to plumbing, so you use cistern water to flush toilets.
Remember that while cisterns have the largest capacity to maximize your water savings and bills, they require heavier upfront costs due to their size and the need to build structural support before installing. Also, some residential cisterns are not legally allowed in some states due to their large capacity. Or you will get fined for installing.
Is rainwater harvesting illegal?
This brings us to common questions and a popular misconception about rainwater barrels and residential cisterns. We hear all the time that “my city doesn’t allow it,” when nowhere in the United States is it illegal to collect rainwater. HOWEVER, many cities have certain restrictions on what you can install, HOW MUCH rainwater you collect, and how much rainwater usage you are allowed. Most of the northeast states highly encourage rainwater harvesting due to delivering rainfall. Your mid-west states tend to allow all types of rainwater collection, but they don’t incentivize it as much, and then your southwestern states have more restrictions on collection. (These are trends that fluctuate every year).
The takeaway is that no state makes it illegal to harvest your rainwater. You only need to read what codes your city has and what the restrictions might be.
Here’s a good rule of thumb, if your municipality or state offers a rainwater harvesting federal tax credit, you are allowed to collect rainwater.
The misinformation is a huge reason our incentive match search engine was created, and we encourage people to use it. Type in your property address to see if rainwater harvesting, rain barrel rebates, or residential cistern systems offer free money to install these projects in your area. Or a very popular program is where cities offer free rain barrels to residents.

General Questions About Rain Gardens
What is a Rain Garden?
Well let’s just start by saying that it’s a beautiful addition to any home, reduces your water pollution by up to 40% and can get you access to government rebates.
As rain hits impervious surfaces like your roof, patio, driveway and sidewalk, it picks up chemicals and pollutants. This water then travels onto the streets where it is contaminated further before polluting and overwhelming our local water systems or bodies of water.
Rain gardens, also called bioretention, are gardens made up of native plants built in a depression of your property intended to capture stormwater run-off. A rain garden neutralizes pollutants and allows water to soak into the ground rather than overwhelming our water systems or contribute to flooding. In fact, rain gardens are effective in removing up to 90% of nutrients and chemicals and up to 80% of sediments from stormwater runoff!
What are the benefits of a Rain Garden?
– Helps prevent flooding to your property and community
– Aesthetically pleasing and enhances property value
– Provides habitat for birds and butterflies
– Helps keep water clean by filtering stormwater runoff
– Recharges groundwater supply
What goes into building a rain garden?
At its simplest, a rain garden is a man-made depression in the ground that can fill with water diverted from the downpipe of a building, or run-off from a hard surface such as a driveway. Rain gardens work as a basin for pooling water and absorb water within a day or two.
It can be landscaped with cobbles, pebbles and gravel, which, with a surrounding rim made from the excavated soil, called a berm, can add some attractive topography to a flat site.
What kind of maintenance is required for a Rain Garden?
Rain gardens built with native plants require little maintenance. Native plants are already adapted to their environment, don’t need a lot of watering and won’t need pesticides. They are easy to establish and grow fast. Native plants have robust root systems that penetrate deep into the soil which allows for good drainage. In fact over maintaining and weeding a rain garden can do more damage then good by accidentally removing native plants that best absorb and filter your stormwater. When maintaining a rain garden you want to look to remove trash and/or any obstructions to the entrance and overflow are of your rain garden.
How does a Rain Garden Look
There are different styles and sizes but here are a few examples:
Where should a Rain Garden be placed in my yard?
Rain gardens should be strategically placed—located where water naturally flows on to your property and/or from impervious surfaces like your roof, driveway/parking area, or hardscapes. Additionally it is important that rain gardens are installed at least 10 feet from your foundation, and at the edge or outside of any tree cover to prevent from damaging tree roots.
Do Rain Gardens attract mosquitos?
Standing water attracts mosquitoes. Mosquitoes need standing water for 7-12 days to complete their life cycle. Rain gardens are designed to hold water for a maximum of 48 hours to ensure they do not become a breeding ground for mosquitoes. In fact, rain gardens should help prevent mosquitoes since they encourage water to drain back into the ground faster.
How much does a Rain Garden cost?
The cost of Rain Gardens can vary regionally. Historically rain gardens can cost anywhere from $20-40/sqft. The following variables can have the most impact to the total cost of your specific rain garden; size, local cost of labor, plant selection, and whether or not your soil conditions require additional modifications like an underdrain or soil amendments to meet adequate infiltration standards.
Are there minimum requirements in order to qualify for an Incentive?
Each incentive program is different and has its own unique standards and requirements based on the local government or region offering the incentive. Some programs will require a minimum project size of your rain garden or permeable pavers, some may require a minimum of impervious area to be treated. It varies from incentive program to incentive program.

About Projects
What is Rainplan?
Rainplan’s mission is to increase sustainable infrastructure on private properties. We do this by matching homeowners with government incentives to make these projects affordable.
How does Rainplan work?
Step 1: Type in a property address.
Step 2: We provide you with local incentive information.
Step 3: For more detailed information about other available programs or financing, create a free account to set up your property dashboard.
Step 4: When you select an incentive that you would like to use towards financing your project, contact a Rainplanner to go over details and to make sure that your project fits the necessary requirements.
Step 5: If you want us to handle the tedious filing process, you can hire us to file and organize all your documents to guarantee that you hit every target necessary to receive an incentive.
What services does Rainplan offer?
Our flagship service is helping you create a Rainplan. Whether you’re looking to solve a specific problem, curious about specific technologies, or just exploring your options for a future renovation we help you create a plan to manage stormwater on your property.
Incentive Matching: We offer a free search engine and property dashboard. Creating an account to keep track of possible incentive programs is free to everyone.
*** In certain markets such as Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia we also offer “Early Access” services such as;
Contractor matching: where we help you find the best possible contractor for your project
Rainplan’s Green Spending Advance: we provide upfront financing for your project and will pay the contractor directly so you don’t have to. You pay us back after the completion of the project in monthly installments.
How does Rainplan make money?
Rainplan is a free service. Our goal is to provide information-your Rainplan-that a property owner can use to make a decision when it comes to stormwater on their property. We often get asked, “How does Rainplan make money?” Currently as we build out our database and customer relationships, we are offering our search engine and Rainplan dashboard services for free. Rainplan makes money when a client selects an incentive and wants us to file all the paperwork and manage their project documents for the incentive program. We only get paid if the client receives an incentive check and our commission is a small percentage from the incentive amount received.
Is there anything specific that Rainplan does not do?
Rainplan is not a contractor. We will not be doing any engineering work or actual installation of your project. For Early Access clients (those living in the Washington DC, Virginia, and Maryland areas) we will take the guessing work out of finding a qualified and vetted contractor by providing you with recommendations and bids from vetted experts.
I already have a contractor. How does Rainplan work with me?
Excellent! If you already have a project in the works we recommend that you create a free account with us. You will also want to contact a Rainplanner as soon as possible to make sure that we can find an incentive program to apply for that will help cover the costs of your project.
Who will a client interact with during each part of the process?
“All my experiences with Rainplan have been tremendous. Everyone has been very responsive and because we were participating in the DC program there was a lot of paperwork, but I didn’t have to do that. They pushed it down the road and took care of getting in touch with me if they needed anything. I don’t know if I would have been able to finish this process without Rainplan. They took me from the original inquiry all the way to the end. It was so easy.” – Amy Butler, DC Rainplan Client
We love that quote because, in a lot of ways, it showcases how we help. If you decide to use Rainplan as your concierge for filing an incentive application, you will most likely be interacting with two people for most of your project process. The first is your hired contractor or engineer (separate from Rainplan) and then your Rainplanner. Our Rainplanners are qualified professionals and mentors who are here to answer any questions about the incentive process related to your project.
What does a Rainplanner do?
Rainplanners are here to guide you to the best possible project for your property type and based on available incentive programs. They will talk with you when you’re ready to start a project and send you an assessment to better help serve your project goals. Rainplan’s online assessment is the first step in studying your property’s water challenges and potential. Our stormwater expert will analyze your property and recommend the most suitable installation that will achieve the following:
- Help solve any drainage or flooding problems
- Utilizes the maximum amount of incentives available in your area
- Adds the most value to your property
Do you have any references you can share?
How can I learn more about Rainplan?
Rainplan has a variety of areas in which we educate and empower. We strongly encourage you to explore our blog which we call “The Runoff”. It has client testimonials, thought pieces from experts in the field, infographics, and more to better help you understand why and how we work with stormwater incentives.
Stormwater Issues
I’m concerned about the water draining into my neighbor’s yard located downhill from me.
We would be draining down into the soil into the already existing system the county has built out. As part of the approval process, the county would require to know where the water is draining to, which is part of the design process.
About Incentives
Are there minimum requirements in order to qualify for an Incentive?
Each incentive program is different and has its own unique standards and requirements based on the local government or region offering the incentive. Some programs will require a minimum project size of your rain garden or permeable pavers, some may require a minimum of impervious area to be treated. It varies from incentive program to incentive program.
Rainplan helps you discover what incentive programs your property is eligible for and understand the program’s specific requirements to ensure you maximize and receive your benefits!
I have a list of incentives, what are my next steps?
Select the incentive(s) that you wish to take advantage of, and we will get started on processing your application.
I have selected an incentive to move forward with, what are my next steps?
Once you select your incentive Rainplan gets busy working on your application and verifying eligibility. Once completed we will schedule a consultation with one of our Rainplanners to walk you through your application for approval prior to submitting it to the incentive program administrator for approval.
Once my project is completed what do I have to provide in order to get my eligible incentive?
Each program typically has an application process that lays out the specific process you need to follow in order to successfully obtain your incentive benefit. Typically you have to file an application so that the government can reserve the funds for you, and so that you are made of the specific requirements for that incentive program. Once you get confirmation that you project has been accepted and *approved (based on you completing the installation), you can start your project. Once your project is completed you must complete the application process by signing that you accept and understand the maintenance requirements, and schedule final inspection.
Rainplan helps ensure property owners receive their incentive benefits, by streamlining the documentation needed for the application process, helping ensure that your installation meets all of the program’s requirements, assist with the selection of a qualified professional installer, and scheduling your final inspection to pass!
I have selected an incentive to move forward with, what are my next steps?
Once you select your incentive Rainplan gets busy working on your application and verifying eligibility. Once completed we will schedule a consultation with one of our Rainplanners to walk you through your application for approval prior to submitting it to the incentive program administrator for approval.
I don’t have any incentives in my area. What do I do now?
First, we recommend creating an account so you can see both local and state incentives, plus if you are in our Early Access regions (Maryland, Virginia, and DC) you will see our Green Spending Advance options. After creating an account if you still do not see any incentive programs, this means that currently the local incentive programs are either full or closed at the moment. When programs in your area reopen we will notify you.
About Financing
Is the estimate free?
Yes, we first conduct an initial online assessment based on both the incentive program’s requirements and your property’s physical characteristics in order to provide you with an estimate of the incentives you will receive and the cost of the installation based on historical market pricing. This gives you a better idea of what the total out-of-pocket costs are for you!
If it is within your budget, then we help you solicit qualified installers to submit competitive proposals based on a site visit to your property. Because proposals require our vendors to put in time and energy to price your project we like to make sure people understand the size of the investment, and are comfortable with it before they provide proposals. Once you receive your proposal you can move forward to making your decision and commitment.
Let Rainplan help you identify the desired green infrastructure incentive program and the price for installation!
Do you know up front what it will cost?
Based on the incentive program requirements and your property’s physical characteristics we provide you with an estimated incentive, estimated market cost, and prequalify you for our “Buy Now, Pay Later” pay overtime program so that you don’t have to spend any money until the project is completed.
You do not know what the final cost will be until after you have received the final pricing from your selected installer and signed their installation proposal with them. Once that is completed Rainplan provides surety of your project completion and incentive benefits!
Do I have to come up with all the money upfront?
No, Rainplan provides a “Buy Now, Pay Later” installment program that allows you to pay over time for your green infrastructure. Payments does not start until your project has been completed and verified. This provides you surety of proper installation and that you receive your incentive benefits.
Let Rainplan give you peace of mind, and help you ensure a quality installation and that you receive your eligible incentives!
Who receives the rebate -- Rainplan or the property owner?
The Property Owner! The stormwater incentives have been designed specifically for the property owner!! Rain Plan sponsors your project and manages the payments to ensure you receive your incentives, and only receives payment from the property owner, not the incentive provider.
Does your plan include warranty and maintenance?
Rainplan installers all offer functional warranties on all their installations. Rainplan is currently working hard on creating affordable and reliable maintenance plans for each of the installations that you opt into if you wish.
Do you have flexibility in pricing?
Rainplan helps you source competitive price proposals, so that you can get the best price for your installation. In addition we offer flexible payment plans that start only after your project is completed.
We have taken advantage of other rebate programs in the past. Is that a problem?
Each incentive program is different. Some programs have a maximum amount of money that an individual property can qualify for, and some have no limits. Its important to research and understand the program requirements and rules that you are interested in.

Rain Harvesting FAQ
Frequently Asked
Is collecting rainwater illegal in my state?
We hear this all the time. “You can’t collect rainwater in my state or city because it’s illegal.” This used to be the case in some areas because cities were trying to prevent mosquito populations, and some water runoff is necessary for cleaning streets and moving mass through combined sewers. HOWEVER, it is not illegal in any US state to collect rainwater, but many areas have specific rules before you can install a rain barrel and how much rain you are allowed to collect each year.
Can I buy any type of rain barrel and get a rebate?
The type and amount of rebate you get for installing a rain barrel depend on the incentive program. We see that many incentive programs require you to get at least a 50-gallon barrel; some even want you to get a specific material like plastic over galvanized steel. When you search for an incentive program, be sure to read the fine print, or we can do that for you. 🙂
I can install a rain barrel myself. Why do I need Rainplan?
You absolutely can install a rain barrel yourself, and there are many youtube videos to show you how. Yet, if you don’t have a certain downspout, this can get tricky. Also, in some cases where your foundation has a slope or you want to install a drip irrigation system, we recommend a contractor. If you want to install a cistern, you will need a contractor (even for the above-ground variety) because they need to design and pour the foundation. We can help get you a rebate for all these projects and send you qualified and vetted green infrastructure contractors in your area. Why stress about it when you can have someone else do that?
Is Rainplan a Contractor?
No, we match you with the best contractors in your area and help you navigate the installation process.
Does a rain barrel require maintenance?
Yep! If you want a route with less maintenance but more initial upfront costs, go with a cistern. For rain barrels, upkeep is mandatory. In the winter, you need to unplug, dry, and store them, so they don’t crack. You need to use the water inside of them within two weeks after rainfall so mosquito larvae don’t form. You also need to clean them out after each rainy season so they don’t smell gross from the decaying twigs, leaves, bugs, etc., that evade the filter. Contractors are willing to schedule seasonal maintenance in most areas and can do this for you if you want.
How quickly does a rain barrel fill up?
Depending on your roof size, your rain barrel will certainly fill up after MOST rain events. For example: from a roof section of 200 sq. ft. if it rains half an inch it will fill up a 60-gallon barrel.
Cistern or rain barrel, what's the difference?
Simply put: rain barrels are great for residential homes, and cisterns are great for commercial properties or larger-scale homes on a huge lot.

Find all local incentives in your area that will reward you for your rain capture.
It has only been within recent years that people have become more aware of the benefits of water capture systems. Rainwater harvesting tanks provide a sustainable source of water while serving as an efficient resource management tool. Explore the types of rainwater harvesting systems to discover the benefits and features of each, so you can decide which type is right for you.
Water is a commodity that we often take for granted. It has become such an integral part of our lives and it is just there, always available when you turn on the tap. Unfortunately, some of us can not say the same about access to clean water or safe drinking water. As water scarcity and water quality become more publicized and/or more prevalent, capturing falling rain gets more visibility. That’s because rainwater harvesting just makes sense.
In addition, these simple solutions also decrease stormwater runoff. Rainwater can easily be used in homes for non-potable purposes. It’s also very practical for garden irrigation, livestock, fountains, and ponds.
Hopefully, the following information will help you understand the pros and cons of each system and where they work best.

Rainwater Collection System
Rainwater harvesting is easy, economical, and sustainable. However, the different techniques vary based on your specific situation, needs, and resources to start.
Rainwater collection systems can be classified into three types: rain barrels or rainwater tanks that are connected directly to the downspout outlet of the gutters; cisterns which are reservoirs buried underground or elevated above ground with a roof structure over the top; rain gardens which are formed by digging out natural grade depressions in order to hold rainwater for later use.
These types vary in size from large-scale systems for villages or towns down to small-scale household rainwater harvesting systems. While rain barrels are simple devices, historically, cisterns and rain gardens can be quite complicated and expensive to construct without a qualified professional. Nevertheless, there are definitely cases where cisterns and rain gardens make the most sense for a particular stormwater situation.
Now I know we just mentioned rain gardens, in the interest of being thorough. These marvels of the gardening world are an endeavor unto themselves, so the focus of this article is specifically on rainwater reuse systems – rain barrels and cisterns.
You can read more about rain gardens here.
Below is a description of each method of rainwater harvesting so that you can evaluate what might be a good fit for you.
Rain Barrels
Often called the “gateway drug” of green infrastructure, rain barrels are usually the easiest option for property owners to start implementing stormwater management on their land. This rainwater harvesting technique was introduced to reduce the amount of rainwater runoff, especially during heavy rainfall events when rainwater flows from downspouts directly into storm drains.
These systems are great for both flood protection (in heavy rainfall regions) as well as for use to irrigate gardens and landscaping.
How Rain Barrels Work
Rain barrels catch and store rain that falls within a certain area or “catchment area.” Typically a catchment area corresponds to the roof area where rainwater falls. Rain barrel(s) are connected directly to gutters in order to catch and store rainwater runoff from a single downspout or multiple downspouts, accumulating water for later use.
Your Best Rain Barrels for Water Capture
Rain barrel drums are made of either food-grade plastic or metal; especially steel, aluminum, or copper. They can also be made out of ceramic, or wood, and the aesthetics of a functional rain barrel are truly only limited by the creativity of the human mind — check out this awesome raindrop design, that also incorporates a watering can for ease of use.
Rain barrels come in numerous designs and sizes depending upon where you live and how much rainwater harvesting is needed. They can range from small 50-gallon rain barrels up to large 500-1000 gallon tanks. Most municipal rebates for rain collection hardware require a barrel size or system capacity of 500 gallons
This collection method consists of a container connected to the gutter downspouts by a flexible hose. Usually, there is a lid and a spout so that it can be easily opened and so that the rainwater can actually be used. As. a best practice, every rain barrel should have an overflow outlet at its highest point in order to prevent the barrel from overflowing and allow proper drainage.
As part of a stormwater management ecosystem, especially in heavy rainfall areas, a connection port allows a flexible overflow tube to send excess rainwater runoff to a cistern below ground level, or a rain garden somewhere on the same property.
Types of Rain Barrels
Rain barrels are one of the most accessible options for stormwater management because there is a spectrum of possibilities when it comes to installation: rooftops rain barrels, underground rain barrels, basement rain barrels, vertical rain barrels, self-contained rain barrel units (consists of a water pump or other components), rainwater tanks; even hybrid systems where rainwater flows into multiple containers.
If you are thinking about purchasing a rain barrel for use on your property, make sure that you use our free tool to search for incentives in your area. All you have to do is put in your property address to view a list of possible rebates, grants, and financing options.
Cisterns
Rainwater harvesting cisterns are truly a juggernaut of rainwater collection, so these systems are great for use in larger structures such as schools, institutions, and restaurants. Typically, they’re buried underground or elevated above ground with a roof structure over the top.
The space around the cistern can either be enclosed or semi-enclosed by walls of cement blocks/concrete brick so it is separated from the surrounding environment while allowing them to breathe (to reduce the risk of rainwater harvesting system mold growth and damage due to rainwater tank neglect).
How Cisterns Work
Cisterns hold rainwater runoff from rooftops, parking lots, driveways, patios, and other impervious surfaces for later use. While the actual catchment system is very similar to rain barrels there are some pretty notable differences between cisterns and rain barrel systems. We’ve put together a page full of infographics on rainwater harvesting systems and more. Take a look at your convenience!
Cisterns often collect water on a larger scale and can include much more complex options for water filtration and for the supply of water. Harvested rainwater may also be treated with chlorine or ozone gas to sanitize it for other uses. In the event of household use, typically, a cistern will be installed on the roof of a structure supplying water for day-to-day use.
This is not the most common use case, but it’s definitely worth mentioning. Compared to cisterns, rain barrels are relatively simplistic but perfectly suitable for most homes.
In most cases, a cistern is installed in or on the ground. That being said, it functions very differently from a well. The essential difference is that wells are connected to the local groundwater. Alternatively, a cistern has a waterproof enclosure and functions reservoir, securing rainwater and keeping it accessible for reuse.
Cistern Construction
Rain Water Harvesting cisterns can range from small 330 gallon tanks up to large 35,000 gallons tanks that are feasible for commercial purposes. Installation is very technical, and a bespoke system is almost guaranteed so unless you’re a contractor that specializes in stormwater management, we definitely recommend getting a local referral.
In larger installations, multiple tanks are connected together to form large rainwater harvesting systems that feed into one common holding tank located below ground level. A cistern can serve multiple functions depending on the number of rainwater collection systems installed, along with how many storage tanks are located in the cistern.
Cisterns date back before medieval times and can be made out of almost anything. They are truly only limited by the creativity of the human mind. Although charming design choices are highly subjective and questionably sound, ideas range from an old-school repurposed water pump to full-blown water features.
Many countries have implemented the use of cisterns are a requirement for all new construction, just highlighting their usefulness in an organizational setting.
The Final Word on Rainwater Harvesting
Collecting rain that falls on your roof and your land is really a no-brainer; especially since (in most cases) you can get a significant portion of your out-of-pocket expenses reimbursed by a stormwater incentive.
All of the options discussed above contribute to:
- improved water quality in your community,
- reduced stormwater runoff,
- leverage nature’s bounty and,
- increase your property value.
Cisterns are great for larger water needs, especially when interested in treating the water for applications other than gardening and irrigation. Rain barrels are the easiest to roll out for general household use. If you have a green thumb, want to beautify your home, or are looking to resolve a situation of pooling water in your yard a rain garden might be the right choice.

53,https://myrainplan.com/residential-rain-water-collection-systems-illegal/,"Recently we posted about residential rainwater collection systems on social media, and it ignited a discussion on whether having a rain barrel was legal or not in their state. We won’t bury the lead here, and rainwater harvesting methods are legal in all 50 states. Each city will have certain restrictions, but there is no place in the United States where catchment systems are entirely banned. So can you collect rainwater in California? Yes. Can you collect rainwater in Tennessee? Yes.
Let’s break down what to look for in each state, and we will share links with you about state water catchment requirements.
DIY Rain Water Harvesting Laws
Do-it-yourself rainwater harvesting has been around, well…, forever. It makes sense that humans naturally want to capture the #1 life-sustaining source. Everyone can agree that if rain falls on your property, it should be yours to keep. However, cities and states started implementing measures making it illegal many years ago after weighing the disadvantages of rain water harvesting, such as growing mosquito viruses and the need for rainwater to help wash street debris.
Old statutes and codes were based on an older generational need; before urbanization, new laws started to take off. In some states, it was illegal because if the water came into your yard from someone’s property-it originated as roof rainwater collection-then you could be accused of stealing since the water didn’t fall on your land.
So as you can see, it was an older way of thinking before mosquito populations could be controlled, before property codes were put in place, and before city infrastructure was overwhelmed by water runoff.
How to Store Rain Water
Rain water harvesting tanks-a fancy name for rain barrels or small ground cisterns-are bins set up for collecting rainwater from gutters. When the water falls on your roof and rolls off, it makes sense to collect it right there at the source. Traditionally rain barrels have been propped up on cinder blocks (gravity helps with water pressure when you hook up a hose or spout) and are connected directly to the downspout on a gutter.
It’s a system that works for water catchment, but what cities were noticing is that not all rain harvesting farmers were adequately taking care of their rain barrel maintenance. Rain water harvesting tanks are not supposed to hold water for more than a few days; otherwise, they become breeding grounds for mosquito larvae and bacteria. Public health officials were also concerned that some people would start using rain water collection for drinking—causing alarm because the chemicals collected from roof pitch, paint, and rust can be detrimental to human health. If people were unwilling to store their rain water properly or use it for drinking, public officials thought it best to outlaw the practice altogether.
Residential Rain Water Harvesting Today
With the understanding of why it was ever considered illegal, let’s talk about the codes and legalities for rain water collection today. All 50 states allow you to collect rain water and be a part of the process of storing rain water. However, some areas have codes and rules that allow for restrictions.
Restrictions you might see:
- -you to only store the water for so long
- -how much are you allowed to collect
- -what materials can you use to collect rain water
- -if you live in an HOA, there are requirements on visibility or maintenance
Colorado is the state with the most restrictions when it comes to water harvesting. Every other state allows rainwater capture, but some require permitting or have specific conditions.

54,https://myrainplan.com/row-home-urban-runoff/,"The Row Home and Urban Runoff
Rowhomes are a popular architecture design in densely populated urban areas, but did you know that row home design had urban runoff in mind? With each passing generation, the world faces new challenges and must continue to rise to the occasion. With better technology, better healthcare techniques, people live longer–we have higher populations living on the planet together for the first time ever. With this comes the need to continuously find space and housing and fill the needs of all communities. Urbanization is often a dirty word that to some convey overpopulation or too much density in one area. However, urbanization is a simple matter of life at this point. Communities have to build in order to fit everyone’s needs as best they can.
With the constant production of new houses, apartments, commercial or office buildings, we see a lot more need for hardscapes (concrete areas). As we add in more impervious surfaces we will continue to put stress on urban water runoff into our drainage systems.
So you see, urbanization is a constant puzzle. While we build homes, we also have to think about how we make sure we don’t add more stressors to our environments. This is where stormwater management comes in.
What is Stormwater?
Stormwater is the technical term for water (rain) runoff from roofs, driveways, and roads. Urban residents haven’t always considered how the flow of stormwater works. The common perception is that stormwater pipes and inlets offer a clear solution to drainage. For a while, this stormwater management technique has worked. Unfortunately, as urban areas grow conventional infrastructure breaks down.
Urban Sprawl and the Water Cycle
When new roads and large homes are built, massive impervious surfaces cover the land. The result is challenging drainage issues, and in some cases, damaging floods. Oftentimes, stormwater cannot infiltrate into the soil. In these cases, it flows downhill until there is a low spot or soil that allows it to percolate into the ground. This is the basis for the water cycle. The more impervious the surface, the more fast-flowing stormwater builds up in volume. As weather patterns shift, certain regions experience more significant rain events than ever. Retrofits have become critical to managing urban stormwater systems. This is where the practice of green infrastructure can assist.
The Historical Context for Stormwater and Rowhomes
Ever wondered why suburban houses are so close together? This style of dense row housing was common for traditional 19th and early 20th-century cities. This architecture allowed workers to live near their place of employment. But, that wasn’t the only consideration.
By design, traditional row home parcels drain stormwater-urban runoff-into the back alley. Engineers designed the alley to function as a large gutter. By delivering stormwater to the main street water flow would eventually meet a nearby inlet. From there, stormwater inlets drain into two places. Wastewater either leads to a treatment plant or flows into a nearby body of water. The latter is more common than most people realize. Despite the focus on environmentalism, this outdated stormwater system is the norm in most urban areas.
Breaking the Runoff Machine
Dr. Steward T.A. Pickett, a Distinguished Senior Scientist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, coined this system as the stormwater machine.
In 2020 he wrote an article called, “Breaking the Baltimore Runoff Machine” explaining the need for disruption to the stormwater machine. The main message is a call to replace impervious surfaces with porous surfaces. Simple solutions, like permeable pavers, are a necessary alternative to polluted streets & waterways.
We can’t assume that simply moving stormwater is the solution to drainage problems, anymore. Our accountability has gotten more complex but the new approach is simple. Slow the flow, and allow it to infiltrate on-site. Supplementing traditional drainage structures is one green infrastructure change that benefits modern cities.",row home urban runoff rowhomes popular architecture design densely populated urban areas know row home design urban runoff mind passing generation world faces new challenges must continue rise occasion better technology better healthcare techniques people live longer higher populations living planet together first time ever comes need continuously find space housing fill needs communities urbanization often dirty word convey overpopulation much density one area however urbanization simple matter life point communities build order fit everyone needs best constant production new houses apartments commercial office buildings see lot need hardscapes concrete areas add impervious surfaces continue put stress urban water runoff drainage systems see urbanization constant puzzle build homes also think make sure add stressors environments stormwater management comes stormwater stormwater technical term water rain runoff roofs driveways roads urban residents always considered flow stormwater works common perception stormwater pipes inlets offer clear solution drainage stormwater management technique worked unfortunately urban areas grow conventional infrastructure breaks urban sprawl water cycle new roads large homes built massive impervious surfaces cover land result challenging drainage issues cases damaging floods oftentimes stormwater cannot infiltrate soil cases flows downhill low spot soil allows percolate ground basis water cycle impervious surface fast flowing stormwater builds volume weather patterns shift certain regions experience significant rain events ever retrofits become critical managing urban stormwater systems practice green infrastructure assist historical context stormwater rowhomes ever wondered suburban houses close together style dense row housing common traditional 19th early 20th century cities architecture allowed workers live near place employment consideration design traditional row home parcels drain stormwater urban runoff back alley engineers designed alley function large gutter delivering stormwater main street water flow would eventually meet nearby inlet stormwater inlets drain two places wastewater either leads treatment plant flows nearby body water latter common people realize despite focus environmentalism outdated stormwater system norm urban areas breaking runoff machine dr steward pickett distinguished senior scientist cary institute ecosystem studies coined system stormwater machine wrote article called breaking baltimore runoff machine explaining need disruption stormwater machine main message call replace impervious surfaces porous surfaces simple solutions like permeable pavers necessary alternative polluted streets waterways assume simply moving stormwater solution drainage problems anymore accountability gotten complex new approach simple slow flow allow infiltrate site supplementing traditional drainage structures one green infrastructure change benefits modern cities
55,https://myrainplan.com/selecting-a-green-infrastructure-contractor/,"They say, “good help is hard to find.” When it comes to property improvements…well, good help is still hard to find.
Unfortunately, almost everyone either has their own story or, knows someone who has been burned by an ill-executed home improvement project. That’s why contractors get a bad rap.
Finding and vetting someone can be difficult, technical, and outright confusing. So, if you’re not a technician yourself, hiring a green infrastructure contractor can feel like a game of chance. The fact is that (just like with anything else) not all install professionals are created equal.
Key Considerations When Selecting a Green Infrastructure Contractor
When it comes to designing a green infrastructure solution on your property, there are a ton of considerations.
Only an experienced professional will really be able to implement a properly functioning system. So, if you’re taking on anything more intensive than, connecting your downspout to a rain barrel, you might want to seriously consider hiring a professional green infrastructure contractor.
Ask the company if they have experience with that specific type of construction.
In the case of green infrastructure, you’ll want to ask about rainwater capture systems, cisterns, green roofs, bioswale installation, rain garden design, and/or conservation landscaping, depending on the project that you’re taking on. Don’t ever be intimidated to ask, as any credible professional knows exactly how technical these projects are and might even consider it a compliment! Also, feel free to ask for pictures or even the locations of other nearby projects they completed.
Ask to see their contractor’s license and ask about any training or certifications that are relevant to that type of installation.
This is really important if you are hoping to file for incentives because a common requirement for getting rebates or other incentives, is that the work is performed by a certified professional. So, if you’re applying for an incentive (why not?) double-check that they have the specific certifications required by the incentive program.
Find out how long it will take to install your project.
Most projects take place during warmer months, so make sure that you get a clear timeline for (1) when the project will begin and end (2) the total length of time that it should take (3) a range of hours so you know how much labor you’ll be paying for (4) any predictable bottlenecks that may delay the timeline (e.g. permitting process, ordering materials, etc.)
Ask them about ongoing maintenance and who will be performing it.
Any qualified professional should be able to help you understand how to maintain your new feature. Ideally, the professional you hire will be the point of contact for maintenance, but if not make sure you understand that ahead of time, so you can plan for it. Also, make sure that you get clarity on seasonal considerations because the last thing you want is for your system to get totally wrecked after the first winter (unlikely, but possible). Here are some examples on maintaining a green roof over the winter.
About Early Access to the RainPro Network
To support property owners through their journey to stormwater sustainability, Rainplan created the RainPro Network. The RainPro Network connects project owners (you) with experienced installation professionals who have specialties in different types of green infrastructure construction.

56,https://myrainplan.com/stormwater-and-esg-investing/,"Stormwater and ESG Investing Trends
On February 17th, 2022, a company called Actual seemingly started to crack an ESG investing trend most companies were struggling with: how to collect and visualize data when it comes to showcasing sustainable practices. Actual (created by LinkedIn alumni and based in San Francisco) raised $5 million, a signal for how demand on ESG accountability is growing.
When it comes to ESG investing, the trends since 2020 have steadily grown. In 2020 alone, ESG investing rose by 4%. With more companies starting to navigate towards capturing more long-term stable investors, ESG has become a significant buzzword.
Yet, companies continue to overlook how stormwater can be a significant component of their ESG principles. If ESG is the new normal, why aren’t more companies adopting stormwater management best practices?
What is ESG Investing
The basics: ESG stands for Environmental, Sustainable, Governance. With ESG investing, people invest in companies based on their adherence or mission towards environmental, sustainable, and governance best practices. Governance is often the outlier of this group that most misunderstand. Governance would include companies with a history of fair and equitable work practices, board management, and salary distribution. Examples of the top ESG investments according to Forbes:
- Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund (VFTAX)
- Parnassus Core Equity Investor (PRBLX)
- Shelton Green Alpha Fund (NEXTX)
(Note that these are mutual funds with large tech companies in their portfolio, which some might find problematic. Another article for another time.)
The term ESG started in 2005 at a United Nations conference concisely titled “Who Cares Wins” (WCW). Both terms, ESG and WCW, were used to prove to financial institutions that companies proving that they care would win long-term investors and had the edge over companies who were not following transparency, environmental, and equity practices.
The conference conferred with global analysts, consultants, governments (the UN has pull), economists, and asset management companies. Their bottom line: ESG is a driving force for long-term investors.
Essentially, if you want a sustained investment, you better be focusing on environmental sustainability.
ESG vs. SRI
SRI (Socially Responsible Investing) was already in the financial narrative during the Vietnam era. Socially responsible investing focuses on not investing in something because of ethical or moral reasons. For example, people stopped investing in Phillip Morris because of tobacco’s ethical implications. SRI was about not investing in dubious companies, whereas ESG focuses on investing in companies for enhanced bottom lines and sustainable and transparent practices.
Where SRIs failed is how they limited investment opportunities. The mere implication that you avoid companies based on social responsibility didn’t encourage or champion investment opportunities for hungry yet conscious investors. At the same time, ESG investment blends conscious investment with strategic financial growth.
The Narrative of ESG Investing
Narrative Economists-economists focusing on how historical and cultural events have impacted economic forces-have had a busy few decades. The Who Cares Wins conference was only the beginning. Little did these experts know that a financial crisis was looming (2008), “woke” culture would be coined eight years later, and fifteen years later, there would be a global pandemic.
If the core of economics is that customer desire determines value, imagine how desires shift throughout crises. During a crisis, accountability is the demand. Think back to the BP oil spill (Deepwater Horizon, to be more specific), BP received overwhelming press and attention that the company had to take down BP signs and rebrand while still struggling to regain public trust. The resurgence of ESG as a high-traffic term can easily be traced to accountability from Covid-19 and the aftershocks of a shifting workforce. Plus, nothing triggers cultural dynamics quite like a global health pandemic where liberties and social responsibility are suddenly scrutinized at a high level.
Narrative economists predicted a surge in ESG investing at the beginning of Covid-19. On top of this, with a new incoming federal administration focused on rejoining Paris climate accords, equity, and infrastructure, it made sense to guess that investor eyes would move towards companies involved in these areas of ESG.
In 2020, ESG investments captured $ 51.1 billion of net new money from investors. For comparison, in 2019, investors accounted for $21 billion into funds that apply environmental, social, and governance principles.
ESG Scores
Spoiler alert, ESG scoring hardly exists. 1 in 5 investors didn’t invest
due to inadequate ESG policies. (This triggers many grumblings from portfolio managers who continuously point to a lack of transparency and visual representations to show accurate ESG data. Remember the company Actual, and this is why people are excited about the new wave of ESG visible data companies.) Until a tech is adopted, most companies rely on PR initiatives and reports to reflect their ideals.
Stormwater and ESG Investing: A Missed Connection
If you have made it this far down in the article, you are about to realize how deep we buried the lead. While companies tighten up their environmental impact, they tend to overlook an effortless staple in sustainability, stormwater management.
Stormwater management is an act of environmental justice as it aims to mitigate water runoff, damage, and pollution out of historically traumatized and disadvantaged low-income areas. Stormwater management is based on environmental justice and sustainable best practices, focusing on using green infrastructure to manage water quality. It also focuses on economic impact for neighborhoods that depend on actuaries, rivers, lakes, and oceans to fund their schools, businesses, and social services.
ESG Scores and Water Quality
As stated above, a current barrier is the lack of data and visual proof for ESG scoring. How can an institution prove its commitment outside of PR and annual reports? Here’s where another advantage of stormwater management comes into play. Companies can easily demonstrate their commitment to water justice since stormwater management includes visible green infrastructure*. Examples of this would be companies who control and manage their water runoff through new parking lots using bioswales to filter pollutants before they hit storm drains. Or rain gardens and landscaping to mitigate runoff. Companies such as Wholefoods in Raleigh, North Carolina, use giant cistern systems to manage runoff and recycle water have a built-in (pun intended) advantage of visual impact. Let’s not forget the documentation of water retention credits as proof too.
The Stormwater Solution
For the month of March, Rainplan’s focus is driven heavily on acquainting property owners with the financial literacy that comes with upgrading to stormwater technologies. The economic benefits of saving on stormwater utility fees, Stormwater Retention Credits, water bills are initially the first benefits listed. Yet, from a company standpoint and in regards to the growing ESG investment trends, using stormwater management as an indicator of environmental and sustainable practice should also be a highlight. With considerable investment from federal infrastructure acts, continuous severe weather, decade-long droughts, and societal accountability–stormwater management makes the most sense.

Did you come to this post looking for rain barrel ideas and information? You’re not alone! With summer technically just starting and the heat index in many areas hitting record highs, many property owners are thinking of creative ways to maintain their yards or keep their soils drought resistant. Using rainwater is one of the best ways to maximize Mother Nature, plus a great utility savings hack.
Drought-resistant landscaping is the new American culture, and many look for ways to start xeriscaping on a budget. Some might find it hard to give up the “lush green yard.” Universities, churches, and commercial buildings like cozy curb appeal and presentation can help sell a message, introduce a persona to your business, and demonstrate commitment to conservation. Still, as more cities adopt stormwater utility fees, higher water bills, and water restrictions, it makes perfect sense for property owners to transition to sustainable landscaping designs. Can this get pricey? Yes. However, we show you ways to incorporate stormwater incentives to make your xeriscaping on a budget a doable process.
When permitting or applying for a stormwater incentive, you might see the phrase, “impervious surface”. An impervious surface is an area where water can not seep into the group, and because of this, it causes water runoff. Let’s look at how this can compound poor water quality in neighborhoods and the types of impervious surfaces you should consider on your lot.
Stormwater utility fees are becoming more popular in metropolitan areas due to declining water quality from runoff. We break down the basics of what stormwater fee charges are, where you find them, and how to stop or lower your bills.

We’ve laid out the top issues that we hear from private property owners, some of the causes, and stormwater best management practices that we would usually recommend. The good news is that many of these problems are pretty straightforward and can be addressed by stormwater best management practices.
Purchasing real estate is a significant endeavor. Whether it’s an investment or your primary residence, real estate represents a fairly stable and secure asset. That’s why there are few horror stories as palpable as the excited property owner discovering that their investment is actually a money pit.
Misplaced water can be a home’s worst enemy.
Water issues are one of the leading reasons real estate deals fall through, and with good cause. That’s because problems related to drainage and groundwater can be nagging and virtually impossible to correct entirely. Oftentimes, they become legacy issues only solved through costly new construction. So, it’s no surprise that many sellers don’t disclose the full extent of stormwater problems or drainage issues to buyers.
An inspection can help to discover property problems, but if your inspection doesn’t happen during or after a rainstorm, you might be stuck with a problem you never considered — think leaky roofs, sinking foundations, soggy yards, pooling water, and the list can go on. What’s even worse, is that in some cases your inspector may

An integrated approach works far better than an isolated singular “fix.” Only you understand your budget, property, and day-to-day stormwater experience. There may be a better or more appropriate option in your unique case. Several green infrastructure solutions could likely be a suitable fit. Feel free to set up a FREE Rainplanning Session. We hope that the following information can help you unpack your stormwater story so you can create a plan for long-term resilience and sustainability.
Common Stormwater Problems and The Most Common Solutions
Stormwater Problem: Permitting Issues Due to New Construction
Since many stormwater problems can be complex to rectify, we’ll starting with the easiest one first. If you’re planning a retrofit or an upgrade to your property, you may have experienced an unusual hiccup. As environmental guidelines increase to accommodate for urban sprawl, more and more applications get denied due to “Impervious surface lot coverage– too high.” This likely means that your current plans add to the existing hardscape — i.e. adding materials like concrete, asphalt, or blacktop.
Growing hardscapes prevent rainwater from behaving in the way that it would in the natural ecosystem. Instead of draining back into the ground, water rapidly flows over pavement, carrying whatever it picks up into the municipal sewer system. Stormwater drainage systems strive to achieve “biomimicry.” This is a fancy way of saying that these systems attempt to imitate (or mimic) the natural way that a local ecosystem deals with rainwater.
Local municipalities are responsible to the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) for preventing the addition of gray infrastructure on private property. This is because 80% of all water pollution happens due to runoff from personal property, and over 70% of land in the USA is private property. Their toolbox includes incentivizing property owners who upgrade using green infrastructure and denying permits that would increase impervious surfaces on private property. Fortunately, several solutions improve permeability and help you break ground on your exciting plans.
Solution to Stormwater Permitting Issues
If you consider a new driveway or installing hard landscaping, permeable pavement may be an option. In cases where permeable pavement is installed correctly (by a professional), it lasts twice as long as standard building materials.
Planning an addition to your home, building a new structure, or installing a pool can also create significant permeability issues. In these cases, expanding the project to include conservation landscaping might be the ticket to winning over the permitting office. This could look like xeriscaping, planting trees, or planting native shrubs to capture stormwater.
Installing a rain garden can significantly increase your permeable footprint. This feature gives stormwater a place to flow, and the materials used help runoff sink stormwater back into the ground. This usually works best in a low point of your yard, and since it incorporates native plants accustomed to local weather patterns, rain gardens require very little maintenance.
Since property grade (the slope of your land), soil composition, and other technical factors come into play, we recommend using our Rainplan Builder to gather the details about your property to know what makes the most sense for your property.
Stormwater Problem: Poor Drainage
Poor drainage is a common stormwater problem and the number one cause of stormwater-related issues. Poor drainage presents itself in many ways, across your entire property – or in some cases, even from your neighbor’s property. For example, if you notice a lot of mosquitos after a rainstorm, you might have pooling water sitting somewhere on your property that fosters mosquito reproduction. (Gross, but true.)
The most common symptom is moisture in the basement or crawl space. This can be outright flooding, but it can also look like damp concrete, spalling bricks, and efflorescence (salty-looking residue on foundation walls). Most homeowners address this by building a french drain (a trough that goes around the interior wall of your foundation) or installing a sump pump. Those solutions only address the symptoms without considering the long-term damage that poor drainage can wield on your property.
Top symptoms and stormwater problems due to poor drainage:
- moss or mildew growth on walkways, concrete staining, and slip hazards
- basement or crawl space flooding and foundation damage
- water pooling (or flooding) on the driveway, garage, and home
- muddy planter areas and damage to your yard, potentially attracting mosquitoes and killing grass
- water draining from your neighbor’s property
- water leaking from the roof
- moss or mildew growth and staining on the roof
Stormwater Solutions for Poor Drainage:
Okay, we said that this is the most common problem, so it’s important to note that drainage issues don’t match with a “one size fits all” approach. The beautiful thing is that this presents you with many options for managing your stormwater. In most cases, the main goal is either finding solutions to sink water back into the water table or to divert excess water into a useable system or a natural system where it can drain on its own while naturally filtering out pollutants.
Best management practices like a dry creek or bioswale can move water off-site while filtering.
If your roof is approaching twilight and it’s time to replace it, installing a green roof will help your next roof last twice as long while providing additional insulation and giving you extra green space.
Stormwater Problem: Excessive Runoff
You’re a responsible property owner. You perform ongoing maintenance and take great care of your investment but there is only so much you have control over when it comes to rainfall. With longer rainfall patterns and more severe snowstorms, there’s an expected increase in heavier rain events with each passing year. So even if you do what you can to make sure your property drainage is taken care of, excessive runoff might still be a problem.
Stormwater Problems and Symptoms of Excessive Runoff:
- Lost plants, shrubs, or trees
- Bare soil where plants won’t grow because it’s too wet
- Structural erosion, cracking sidewalks, or eroding driveways
- Clogged storm drains (resulting in pooling water)
- Community water quality issues
Stormwater Solutions for Excessive Runoff
So, the first option to mitigate excessive runoff begins at the very top: your roof. Installing a green roof is something you’ll see around the nation’s capital and in some major metro areas. Installing a green roof will slow down falling stormwater, adds useable green space to your property, significantly increase insulation, and double (YES, DOUBLE) the life of your roof. The slope of your roof may limit your options, but getting a consultation can’t hurt. Also, if the roof doesn’t work as a viable solution, consider the roof on detached garages or carports.
Another option to mitigate excessive runoff is installing a water harvesting system. Depending on your budget and goals, the design of your rainwater harvesting system can look different. Maybe it’s a downspout connected to rain barrels. It could also be an underground cistern that feeds a gray water system for use inside your home.
Keep in Mind
We can’t say what your goals are, but rainwater harvesting is one of the most customizable, flexible, and creative ways to handle your stormwater. An important aspect is that harvested rainwater generally creates “gray water” instead of potable (drinking water), but every system is as unique as the property that it’s built upon. Adding additional filtration and water treatment to your system could be the first step in your goal to go “off the grid.”
If your issue is bare spots in your yard, this is an excellent opportunity to explore installing a rain garden. These unique landscaping features use native plants and increase your property value and offer the rainwater somewhere to go. To learn more about the technical aspects of a rain garden, you can check out our rain garden FAQs page.
If a dedicated rain garden isn’t your “thing,” then a more integrated approach would be conservation planting. This means using specific plants and landscaping materials to slow down and sink runoff back into the ground.
Finally, let’s not forget about permeable pavers. This is especially useful if a large portion of your property is covered with concrete. Impervious surfaces like patios and driveways create hardscapes that will eventually crack and erode as water flows over and around them. So, if you’ve noticed some wear and tear on your hardscapes, it could be a perfect time to replace them with permeable pavement. An added benefit is that this type of pavement lasts twice as long as a standard impermeable solution (like blacktop concrete).

61,https://myrainplan.com/stormwater-retention-credits/,"Thanks to a decades-long investment in thought leadership and millions spent in marketing, solar power has created a level of awareness about rebates for “sustainable” home improvements. Now that society wrapped our heads around that, stormwater, the unruly little brother of solar, has told consumers to “hold my beer” while they do one better.
Enter: stormwater retention credits.
These innovative financial incentives are a little unconventional, but understanding how they work could make a serious impact on the bottom line of your next project.
What are Stormwater Retention Credits (SRCs)?
SRC programs are kinda like extra credit that you can get on a class assignment. The difference is that once you’ve earned that extra credit, you can sell the excess points off to another student who needs those points to pass.
So, how does that work with stormwater and why is this “a thing”?
The Non-Glamorous Truth About How Stormwater is Handled (the sewers)
There’s a reason that urban areas are called “concrete jungles.” That’s because over time our landscapes have been slowly converted into hardscapes. Unfortunately, unlike the jungle floor, water is not soaked back into the soil because concrete is pretty much an impermeable solid.
That means that water falling onto impervious surfaces (think roads, roofs, sidewalks, etc.) sits on top of the surface until it can flow somewhere else. In many cases, the resulting runoff flows into a sewer or “gray infrastructure” if it is not mitigated through some form of “green” infrastructure.
Combined Sewer Systems
Depending on the age and size of the system, as well as the kind of system (combined versus separate pipes), stormwater infrastructure can be easily overwhelmed during large rain events and that leads to surface flooding. To avoid excess water from running into high traffic areas, they redirect excess water runoff. This outflow is normally funneled towards local streams, lakes, and rivers.
Ideally, the water is treated before it ever reaches its destination. However, this is rarely the case. For people who live in many urban areas, it has become almost commonplace for a boil water advisory to take effect after every major rainstorm and now you know why.
Simply put, to ensure local water quality and to make sure the polluted water doesn’t infiltrate the water supply, stormwater needs to be treated. This can happen either onsite by local green infrastructure (GI) or by municipal treatment facilities. Since the latter are unable to keep up with the pace of urbanization and climate change, they encourage or incentivize property owners to build GI on their sites.
This is the major driver of SRCs and a huge factor in the campaign to motivate private sector adoption of green infrastructure.
Urban Water Quality
When rain runs off impervious surfaces such as sidewalks, streets, and roofs, it collects a wide range of toxic pollutants, which are then dumped, usually untreated, into local waterways. Motivated by the obligation for municipalities to make cities more resilient, livable, and equitable, many cities are taking steps to reduce stormwater runoff through large-scale “green infrastructure” (GI) solutions.
Most cities’ GI plans include modifications to existing paved spaces on public properties and in the public right-of-way such as streets and sidewalks.
Unfortunately, the general municipal response still lags behind the effects of stormwater pollution, which is part of the reason that the EPA initiated the Clean Water Act.
The Clean Water Act (CWA) establishes the basic structure for regulating discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United States and regulating quality standards for surface waters.
In the context of urban stormwater, green infrastructure (GI), or stormwater management practices (SMPs), keep polluted stormwater on or near the site where the rain falls—and out of waterways—until it can be treated, evaporate back to the atmosphere, be used onsite, or filter into the ground to benefit vegetation and replenish groundwater supplies.
The Cost to Develop Land
The most common and straightforward way for cities to realize some of the GI (green infrastructure) potential of private land is by requiring on-site stormwater retention as a condition of a construction permit.
New developments above a certain size and large retrofit projects are required to treat a certain amount of stormwater on-site, to comply with water quality standards. Stormwater credit trading programs enable property owners who are subject to an on-site retention requirement to meet a portion of their requirements by purchasing SRCs. These stakeholders may purchase “credits” through a managed marketplace.
Why incentivize the private sector?
Private property is a substantial contributor to stormwater runoff. In fact, 80% of urban areas are privately owned. The private sector is integral to combatting stormwater flooding. Most land is held by private landowners and thus, the private sector contributes far more to stormwater issues like flooding, pollution, and property damage. So cities and municipalities are developing their own programs to engage private property in the fight against water pollution.
The City of Seattle’s program has helped to improve water quality in Lake Washington for example. Or in Washinton DC, RiverSmart programs are in place to help the Anacostia River.
Satisfying water quality requirements will often necessitate controlling pollution from public and private property. In addition, stormwater management opportunities can be less expensive on private land than on public land.
Who Sells SRCs?
Stormwater retention credits are created through projects that implement stormwater management practices to store, detain, or treat stormwater runoff. The property owner who has implemented GI on their site is the one who is allowed to sell the credits granted to them by the local municipal program.
In order to get credits, GI practices can include green infrastructures such as rain gardens, bioswales, and permeable pavement. The goal of the SRC program is to promote these types of practices in order to reduce stormwater runoff and improve water quality.
Getting Paid Using SRCs
For some projects, it may actually be feasible to be the creator of stormwater retention credits, and thus create a sustainable revenue stream for other developers. An SRC aggregator can fund a variety of projects by including these technologies in their construction plans by planting trees, rain gardens, vegetated swales, porous pavement, and green roofs. These projects help to improve water quality and reduce the amount of stormwater runoff entering our local watersheds.
How can land developers leverage SRCs?
What this means is that as a developer or property owner, it’s actually possible to play on either side of the SRC equation. Either you can leverage the SRC marketplace to purchase credits from others with GI and mitigate your stormwater obligations, or you can organize your next project with green infrastructure in mind to capitalize on the opportunity to sell stormwater retention credits or cover your government requirements.
How to start with SRCs
Whether you want to start selling credits because you have green infrastructure on your property, or if you are a larger commercial project looking to help offset regulation costs by buying credits, the best way to get started is to reach out to your local stormwater or groundwater program. Each city has different stipulations and compliance requirements for obtaining SRCs, and some urban areas-or most likely smaller cities or rural areas-might not even have a SRC program in place. Most SRC programs are created by larger cities near life-sustaining bodies of water.
If you are looking into finding out how these programs are created and why they exist we encourage you to dive in deeper with this SRC program guide.
At Rainplan we also utilize SRCs when helping private property owners develop a plan for how they can manage stormwater on their site. Our database includes SRC programs in our incentive matching process, so if your property qualifies for this program you will see it show up in your dashboard.

62,https://myrainplan.com/swppp/,"When preparing to execute a significant construction project, stormwater pollution prevention is likely the last thing on your mind. However, if your project requires a permit, you’ve probably been confronted with SWPPP. Likely, this isn’t the first time you’ve heard about pollution prevention, but understanding what goes into compliance is another story.
What is a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan?
A stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) is an element of your site plan that identifies steps to control erosion and runoff from areas where pollutants may be present. In some cases, facilities that reduce their stormwater pollution below compliance requirements can actually generate a profit from their stormwater pollution prevention activities. (More on that later)
Although the title of your state-specific stormwater compliance policies may have different labels (look for keywords like Erosion, Sediment, Stormwater, and Best Management Practices), they tend to have many common elements. For further details on federal water quality standards, you can look at the Official EPA SWPPP Guide. For the scope of this article, we’ll try to stick to understanding compliance and the application process versus a fully comprehensive overview.
So, let’s dive into what you need to get your site compliant to file your permitting application ONCE and break ground ASAP.
Basic Steps on Preparing a Compliant SWPPP:
- Get a basic lay of the land. You’ll want to survey, identify, and understand your soil, site grade, and relevant local watersheds. This is also a great time to start doing research on commercial incentives* available to Green Infrastructure. Create a Free Rainplan account to search for incentives by site address and view options on your Rainplan Dashboard.
- Review EPA Considerations, both federal and local. Here is a Summary of State Stormwater Standards provided by the EPA. You’ll likely still want to check your state website for the most updated information. Here’s a list of state EPA agencies.
- Identify on-site and resulting pollutants from the project to identify the specific stormwater controls necessary for your project.
- Select stormwater control options, including green infrastructure solutions and SRCs.
- Submit “Construction Ready” SWPPP to the stormwater management department in your state.
- Upon getting approval, implement your stormwater prevention plans.
- Submit your permitting application.**
- Schedule your inspection.**
* Most states offer considerable Commercial Incentives for Green Infrastructure. For the latest information, schedule an appointment with a Rainplanner. You can also browse a list of Commercial Incentives
** Depending on your state, your local EPA may need the inspection before applying. Some states provide a list of approved third-party inspectors. Others yet, schedule the inspection for you upon submitting your application.
What Details Go Into an SWPPP?
The SWPPP must list steps taken to control erosion and runoff before, during, and after construction. At a high level, the goal is to prevent pollutants from entering any waters of the United States during rainstorms. You’ll need to visit your local and municipal agency for specific quantities and calculations. Find your state here.
Primary EPA Considerations for your SWPPP
The state requires an SWPPP for any construction activity where erosion and runoff could add pollutants to stormwater. Important considerations the EPA will care about include:
- changes the existing grade level of at least one acre of land (Important if your project includes site excavations or grading)
- discharges to United States waters during construction activities (Important for excavations, filling operations, and disposals of dredged or fill material, excluding de minimis discharges)
- Areas with “Temporary Impacts” (land-disturbing activities that have a “temporary water quality impact”) including construction activity that has impacts less than or equal to one acre
- Local Permits/Specific General Permits – it’s crucial to review specifications with your state environmental quality agency for any outliers that may apply to your project. (More on that below)
State or Regional Specific Considerations
It’s essential to check with the Environmental Protection Agency in your state. (find a list of EPA regions & State Agencies here) to ensure you don’t lose time resubmitting your application. Different states have different standards, so make sure that you’ve included all the relevant schematics and summaries.
Standard documents to look for may be titled any of the following:
- Construction Site Best Management Practices Plan
- Best Management Practices Plan
- Construction Best Practices Plan
- Erosion Control Plan and Best Management Practices
- Erosion, Sediment, and Pollution Prevention Plan
- Erosion and Sediment Control Plan
- Sediment and Stormwater Plan
Types of Pollutants that could be present on the construction site:
All identified or suspected pollutants present on the construction site must be disclosed in the stormwater pollution prevention plan. Different construction sites create various yet specific pollutants and degrees of pollution. These may include water-borne materials, petroleum products, pesticides, fertilizers, and chemicals used for equipment operations. Sediment is also an important factor and consideration that could interfere with SWPPP compliance and prevent approval of your permit application, so be sure you account for it. This may also include sediment impacts resulting from erosion control measures.
Standard Stormwater Mitigation Options
- Green Infrastructure – for commercial projects planting trees, installing a bioswale, and using permeable pavement for hardscapes are popular and scalable measures to mitigate stormwater runoff. This option is advantageous for most because a majority of states offer considerable incentives for commercial, non-profit, HOA, educational and government construction projects. Green infrastructure also allows some projects to produce stormwater retention credits (SRCs).
The SRC instrument allows projects that reduce their stormwater pollution below the requirements to generate a profit from their stormwater pollution prevention activities.
- Sediment Fences – Temporary fencing designed to prevent soil erosion. While sediment fences are not required controls, they may positively enhance some permit applications for more permanent erosion controls.
- Soil Binders – Another tool that is not required but may offer leverage by keeping soil on construction sites. Some examples are straw bales, balled mulches, or biodegradable netting.
- Daily Cover – A temporary erosion control measure that prevents exposed soils from absorbing rainwater. Examples include large wood chips, straw, landscape fabric, and gravel.
- Properly Storing and Containing Materials – This includes keeping any material piles covered in areas where rain could wash them into the waters of the United States.
Other Considerations for SWPPP Compliance
SRCs (stormwater retention credits) – This option is available to offset stormwater pollution in a few states. Commercial properties can sell stormwater “credits” to other entities to offset the latter entity’s stormwater mitigation obligation by building additional green infrastructure. Read more on stormwater retention credits.
Passing the SWPPP Inspection
Once your plan is submitted (usually), it will be reviewed for compliance with EPA regulations by an approved third-party inspector. In some cases, depending on the state and project size, the state may hire a certified inspector to analyze your property.
What Does an SWPPP Inspector Look For
When inspecting SWPPP compliance, an inspector will ensure all necessary measures are in place. In virtually all cases, stormwater controls must be implemented (not just planned) according to the SWPPP to pass the SWPPP inspection.
An approved plan that addresses stormwater controls includes doing the following:
- Covering exposed soils to prevent erosion
- Removing all pollutants from work areas before they enter the waters of the United States
- Plans should ensure construction vehicles don’t cross waterways, if possible. Vehicles that cross waterways must be treated before leaving the site to prevent the spread of pollutants.
- An outline of sediment control measures prevents stormwater from carrying soils or pollutants into nearby water bodies. Sites can install a sediment fence or vegetation cover to absorb rainfall and prevent runoff from leaving the construction area.
What if there is a stormwater violation at the construction site?
Any stormwater controls that are not installed or maintained according to the SWPPP could lead to a stormwater violation. In addition, both state and (federal) EPA inspectors may conduct separate inspections of construction sites, and both can issue violations.
Navigating Your SWPPP Application Process
Having a plan to reduce your pollution is good for a lot of reasons, but it’s essential if you’re looking to break ground on a new construction project. Hopefully, this guide has helped you understand a bit more about what you need to have in order for your SWPPP.
Large-scale projects often have a huge impact on water quality, which can either be a blessing or a blight to the local community. This is one of the many reasons that states, counties, and municipalities offer large-scale grants, rebates, and incentives to help implement green infrastructure for these types of projects.

63,https://myrainplan.com/takoma-park-maryland-stormwater-management/,"If your property repeatedly flooded due to poor stormwater management and water coming from further uphill, what would you do to fix it? Would you try and control the flooding on your own lawn or go directly to the source? Even if that meant you pay your uphill neighbors to improve their landscaping as a solution?
That’s exactly what some residents in Takoma Park, MD, are undertaking with a new agreement to install a series of rain management projects across five properties and pay for it collectively.
Landscaping solutions to flooding problems are frequently cheaper and more effective when coordinated throughout a whole block or neighborhood scale. As cities and stormwater utilities work to improve their stormwater management infrastructure, support for this type of collaboration would enhance landscaping, lessen infrastructure load, and promote better water quality throughout the community instead of focusing time and money on publicly owned land projects.
What are these homeowners doing for stormwater management?
As described by David Reed and Andrea Kutter, writing with Takoma Stormwater Solutions, Takoma Park, MD, is a hilly, moderately dense suburb of the Washington, DC metropolitan area. After a storm, it is not uncommon for houses at the bottom of these hills to have pools of standing water in their yards, erosion around trees and foundations, and basement flooding. Typically, this is where the story ends, and those low-lying households just have to find a way to manage this problem themselves.
Yet, heavy rain events in the area have become more severe and frequent, and the flooding is beginning to affect more properties at higher elevations. It was an extreme event in September 2020 where 4 inches of rain fell in under 2 hours, spurring five households to band together to solve their problems under a joint PES agreement.
What is a PES Model?
The PES model stands for Payment for Environmental Services (PES) or some call it Payment for Ecosystem Services. A PES can cover a wide range of services in agriculture, textiles (lumb and wool for example), watershed, biodiversity, eco-tourism, and climate change.
Reed and Kutter note that PES is simply “an arrangement by which Party A pays Party B so that Party B will undertake activities that result in increased environmental benefits accruing to Party A.” In any introductory economics course, students will recognize this as a straightforward contract to address an externality. To those not taking intro to economics, the PES model is an agreement between two parties where one is willing to pay for the other person’s work, as long as they reap the environmental benefits.
Takoma Park, Maryland Stormwater Management
In Takoma Park, all five households were neighbors with their homes “aligned contiguously down a steep street.” The three houses nearer to the bottom had already dealt with recurring flooding for years and had invested tens of thousands of dollars trying to solve the problem within their property lines. The other two houses stayed dry and didn’t even realize this recurring flooding was happening. When the severe rain came in 2020, all five homes experienced water damage, and their shared experience sparked a conversation about perceived causes. They concluded that investment in individual property solutions had already failed and decided to enlist an engineer and landscape architect to provide an analysis of their whole block.
The analysis came back with a recommendation of $32,500 in improvements.
That breaks down to $22,000 for the two hilltop households and $3500 for the properties downhill.
Most of these recommendations were for green infrastructures like rain gardens, bioswales, and other landscaping solutions that mimic natural water systems. The analysis also observed that the city’s 50-year-old stormwater infrastructure could not carry the increased volumes caused by the heavier storms.
The financial details of the eventual PES agreement are included in Reed and Kutter’s paper, but the most important outcome is the agreement.
- The three most impacted properties paid more than an equal share for the work since they would receive the most benefits from reduced flooding.
- The uphill properties paid much less but allowed the significant project to move forward on their properties, re-landscaping their homes that would primarily benefit other properties.
What does this mean for other cities and stormwater utilities?
This simple PES agreement and models like it are not simply contracts between private residents. They hold enormous potential for local governments because they reduce the cost of new stormwater management projects, boost available funding, and extend the usefulness of existing infrastructure.
Governments spend billions of dollars annually on stormwater management infrastructure to reduce flooding and keep rivers and lakes healthy. Most of this money is spent on gutters or storm drains to collect water, sewers or culverts from conveying water away, and treatment plants to clean the water as much as possible before releasing it back into the environment. Almost all of this infrastructure is located on publicly owned streets and land.
Yet these billions are not enough. Our existing infrastructure is getting older, construction costs have increased, any new growth or development that occurs upstream increases the stress on infrastructure downstream, and climate change is altering the intensity and frequency of rainfall.
Why PES Matters to City Stormwater
Our infrastructure strategy is expensive because it has to fit within publicly owned land. Water competes for attention with power, gas, and broadband utilities. Costs are reduced through PES and similar models because residents make water management improvements on their private property which can impact overall neighborhood watershed. Landscaping solutions can be more effective when installed throughout neighborhoods or cities.
Perhaps more importantly, private property owners are allowing access to their land and putting up money to install projects. An average person would contribute money to improve their yard with an attractive rain garden or dry pond much more readily than a concrete sewer expansion project down the street. Takoma Park residents are wealthier than average, but five households put up more than $6000 for this project. (That doesn’t include the previous $40,000 the lower-lying households had invested in their landscapes without success.)
Finally, the city directly benefits from the private project extending the useful life of the public stormwater infrastructure. It would undoubtedly have been much slower and more costly for the residents to lobby the city to replace whatever deteriorated infrastructure was evaluated by the residents’ engineer. That work will need to take place eventually, but this cuts the risk of further property damage.
Although the city was a missing partner in this example, Reed and Kutter quickly point out that there are many opportunities for the city to get involved and replicate this success. Takoma Park has done more than most to invest and incentivize green infrastructure, but there are still simple opportunities to improve.
- A small grant could pay for the upfront assessment services (and help prioritize opportunities throughout the community).
- A rotating loan fund can provide installation capital.
- A matching fund or incentives could be provided for specific stormwater solutions to improve quality or consistency.
- Direct grants could be offered to licensed, vetted contractors to carry out projects.
Rainplan is Building a Green Infrastructure Marketplace
Rainplan is a fast-growing business with a mission to connect property owners, contractors, and incentive programs. The example set by this PES agreement happened because five homeowners were motivated, educated, and wealthy enough to make it happen, but it shouldn’t be this hard….
Rainplan designed a green infrastructure marketplace with expertise in finding funding, technologies, and vetted local contractors to help mitigate stormwater damage and costs for private property owners. For residents or neighborhoods looking for funding and project resources, we are adept at finding the right government incentives for each property owner and at connecting them to contractors. Our Virtual Site Planner can also help give power back to the property owner by educating them on the possible technology for their property based on slope measurements and lot size.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION
Binding Arbitration
If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website: www.adr.or g. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Delaware. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use.
In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
Restrictions
The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
Exceptions to Arbitration
The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

Upgrade your old driveway or patio with savvy permeable pavers. Permeable pavers, sometimes called pervious pavers, are not only beautiful but help keep our waterways clean and are the most cost-effective than traditional concrete pavement. They are key drivers in sustainable building and amp up your curb appeal. 76% of agents agree that curb appeal is the number one thing you can do to make your home more appealing.
In 2020 alone, adding in pavers and decks to a property saw a 25% increase in home improvements. With more people working from home it made sense to improve outdoor areas. Permeable pavers for driveways and patios are an easy and practical way to join in on the home improvement boom.
What are impermeable surfaces?
Impermeable surfaces are surfaces that do not allow water to pass through them. On your property, these can be driveways, patios, sidewalks, parking areas, and rooftops. Since water cannot go through these surfaces, it travels over them and picks up pollutants along the way, creating an environmental burden on our local waterways. Did you know that municipalities across the country charge property owners an annual fee for the amount of impervious surface on your property? Replacing impermeable surfaces with pervious pavers can reduce this annual government fee and come with added benefits.
How are permeable pavers different from traditional concrete driveways?
Permeable pavers allow rain and snow to soak into the ground with porous materials and specific designs. The beautiful designs-consider a cool grass driveway- are not only for looks but serve a purpose—water is able to reach the ground in between the spaces of individual pavers. A standard concrete driveway forces water to flow over it and around it, leading to flooding, erosion, and runoff. The material is so thick that water can not soak through and usually concrete pavers are on a slant only encouraging fast water runoff. Pervious surfaces limit runoff at the source, reduce downstream erosion and improve our water quality.
What are the benefits of installing permeable pavers?
Reduced flood risk. Permeable pavers allow water to soak into the ground rather than collect around your property, posing a flood or pooling risk. Sitting water can damage foundations, vegetation on property, and attract mosquitoes and their larvae. Having water drip back into the ground prevents damage to not only your property but also to your property’s ecosystem.
Durability. Permeable pavers are up to four times stronger than a concrete pavers driveway and last two times longer. Permeable pavers have joints that make it flexible and durable as the ground changes. Unlike concrete pave ways, it won’t crack when there is an earthquake or when the ground beneath contracts and expands.
Easy repairs and low maintenance. When concrete cracks and needs fixing, repairs can be costly. Alternatively, permeable pavers are easy to repair because it can happen one stone at a time. Permeable pavers for driveways also require 0% to 25% of the salt application of conventional materials in the winter months.
Beautiful, unique designs. Permeable pavers come in many unique designs to fit your style and make your home stand out. You can even mix and match grass driveway designs with stone. This has become a popular design along with mixing in gravel with other larger stone designs. They also have a higher resale value than concrete because of their longer lifespan and visual appearance.
Eco-friendly. Permeable pavers reduce stormwater runoff and filtrate water that runs through them which means cleaner water soaks into the ground. When water travels downwards through the varying layers, it is filtered, removing pollutants that would have otherwise entered our local water systems. The slow filtration also cools down the water, which puts less pressure on our water systems.
How much do permeable pavers cost?
Although permeable pavers generally have higher upfront costs than traditional materials like concrete or asphalt, they have a much higher return on investment. Permeable pavers are more durable and last longer than concrete and provide solutions for stormwater management. This can reduce construction costs for residential and commercial developments by reducing the need for some conventional drainage systems. Additionally, permeable pavers increase curb appeal, which directly leads to higher property values.
Many cities offer incentive programs for permeable pavers installation, which can drive the cost down significantly. In D.C., for example, incentive programs provide up to $4,000 to put towards the cost of permeable paver installation.
Speaking of incentive programs…
How can I get started with permeable pavers on my driveway?
Incentive programs make permeable pavers more affordable but are underused and come with a complex, lengthy process. Rainplan is the expert in incentives for stormwater management. Rainplan’s user-friendly platform simplifies the process for you and takes care of all the hard work. We handle the tedious application process, connect you with reputable contractors and provide eligible funding upfront, so you have it when you need it most. You can be confident knowing that you’re getting the best cost for your permeable pavers and the highest return on investment. Enjoy all the benefits and beauty without worrying about any of the complexities of working with the government. The easiest way to add stunning, beneficial permeable pavers to your property is to use Rainplan as your concierge for funding and finding contractors to help implement your project.
Step 1: Make sure you enter your address to find out what incentive programs are available to you in your area.
Step 2: Connect with a Rainplanner. You will get email reminders to schedule a free consultation to talk about your potential incentives, but you can also schedule a call directly from your dashboard.
Step 3: Take a look at your property dashboard so you can better understand how the rain sits on your land and how it can flow into neighboring areas.
Step 4: Speaking of neighbors, make sure you share Rainplan with your community because water runoff and curb appeal are dependent on what your neighborhood does too!",calculating concrete driveway costs consider cost effective permeable pavers upgrade old driveway patio savvy permeable pavers permeable pavers sometimes called pervious pavers beautiful help keep waterways clean cost effective traditional concrete pavement key drivers sustainable building amp curb appeal agents agree curb appeal number one thing make home appealing alone adding pavers decks property saw increase home improvements people working home made sense improve outdoor areas permeable pavers driveways patios easy practical way join home improvement boom impermeable surfaces impermeable surfaces surfaces allow water pass property driveways patios sidewalks parking areas rooftops since water cannot go surfaces travels picks pollutants along way creating environmental burden local waterways know municipalities across country charge property owners annual fee amount impervious surface property replacing impermeable surfaces pervious pavers reduce annual government fee come added benefits permeable pavers different traditional concrete driveways permeable pavers allow rain snow soak ground porous materials specific designs beautiful designs consider cool grass driveway looks serve purpose water able reach ground spaces individual pavers standard concrete driveway forces water flow around leading flooding erosion runoff material thick water soak usually concrete pavers slant encouraging fast water runoff pervious surfaces limit runoff source reduce downstream erosion improve water quality benefits installing permeable pavers reduced flood risk permeable pavers allow water soak ground rather collect around property posing flood pooling risk sitting water damage foundations vegetation property attract mosquitoes larvae water drip back ground prevents damage property also property ecosystem durability permeable pavers four times stronger concrete pavers driveway last two times longer permeable pavers joints make flexible durable ground changes unlike concrete pave ways crack earthquake ground beneath contracts expands easy repairs low maintenance concrete cracks needs fixing repairs costly alternatively permeable pavers easy repair happen one stone time permeable pavers driveways also require salt application conventional materials winter months beautiful unique designs permeable pavers come many unique designs fit style make home stand even mix match grass driveway designs stone become popular design along mixing gravel larger stone designs also higher resale value concrete longer lifespan visual appearance eco friendly permeable pavers reduce stormwater runoff filtrate water runs means cleaner water soaks ground water travels downwards varying layers filtered removing pollutants would otherwise entered local water systems slow filtration also cools water puts less pressure water systems much permeable pavers cost although permeable pavers generally higher upfront costs traditional materials like concrete asphalt much higher return investment permeable pavers durable last longer concrete provide solutions stormwater management reduce construction costs residential commercial developments reducing need conventional drainage systems additionally permeable pavers increase curb appeal directly leads higher property values many cities offer incentive programs permeable pavers installation drive cost significantly c example incentive programs provide put towards cost permeable paver installation speaking incentive programs get started permeable pavers driveway incentive programs make permeable pavers affordable underused come complex lengthy process rainplan expert incentives stormwater management rainplan user friendly platform simplifies process takes care hard work handle tedious application process connect reputable contractors provide eligible funding upfront need confident knowing getting best cost permeable pavers highest return investment enjoy benefits beauty without worrying complexities working government easiest way add stunning beneficial permeable pavers property use rainplan concierge funding finding contractors help implement project step make sure enter address find incentive programs available area step connect rainplanner get email reminders schedule free consultation talk potential incentives also schedule call directly dashboard step take look property dashboard better understand rain sits land flow neighboring areas step speaking neighbors make sure share rainplan community water runoff curb appeal dependent neighborhood

Property Projects Are Affordable-if You Know Where to Find Financial Assistance
The government wants you to have a rain plan.
Adoption of green infrastructure – specifically stormwater infrastructure – can be a tough sell for businesses and homeowners. It’s not apathy towards embracing the concept of sustainability. It’s that home improvements are often costly and don’t always show an immediate return on investment. As has been the case with renewable energy sources like wind and solar, tremendous investment at the state and federal level has been made to incentivize the undertaking of green stormwater infrastructure projects.
Unlike utility-scale energy projects, these programs must be utilized by property owners for their impact to be felt – and it’s not always easy to navigate the process or figure out the type of aid available in each city or state. As part of our commitment to the long-term greening of the country’s stormwater infrastructure, we help clarify the available incentive programs also known as government subsidies.
Let’s break down the different types of financial assistance and how they differ.
Types of Incentive Programs
Development incentives
This type of incentive is targeted at real estate developers to bring new projects on board with sustainable features and components. Developers willing to seek out targeted incentive programs may see speedier permitting processes, beneficial zoning rulings and stormwater credits, and reduced requirements. One successful example is the Grey to Green Initiative in Portland, OR that offered cash reimbursements and expedited permitting applications for green roof projects. The program helped drive significant adoption of green infrastructure in the city.
Grants
Cities, states, and government agencies also offer direct cash payments to homeowners, community groups, and business owners to drive targeted investment in specific green infrastructure areas. There are both small grants that individual homeowners can apply for and larger federal grants that cities can apply for if their goal is to undertake large-scale upgrades to their stormwater infrastructure.
Rebates and tax credits
Rebates in the form of tax credits or reimbursement are among the most common forms of incentive to drive green infrastructure spending at the private level. Credits are available for a wide-ranging list of green infrastructure projects, including permeable pavement installation, green roofs, stormwater collection tanks, rain barrels, gutter upgrades, and rain gardens. Landowners may be required to provide substantial documentation outlining their project, associated costs, and performance metrics.
Awards and certifications
An award or a certificate for stormwater might not result in immediate cash back into an owner’s pocket but could have longer-term ramifications like increased property values. Like LEED accreditation for energy efficiency, certifications are developed related to a property’s watershed impact. LEED certifications are prestigious, and BLUE Certified homes may eventually see a similar status upgrade.
Stormwater fee reductions
Suppose you pay a monthly water bill to your city, town, or municipality. In that case, a portion of that bill will be related to your property’s contribution to the demand on the water authority’s stormwater network. Property owners who make an effort to reduce the amount of impervious coverage on their land will frequently be rewarded with a reduced stormwater fee on their monthly bill. Reduction of fees can lead to significant annual savings, especially if the projects are completed utilizing other sources of funding mentioned above like grants, rebates, and development incentives.
Rainplan’s goal is to make it easier for homeowners and businesses to tap into all of these different funding sources, upgrade their properties with green infrastructure, save money and reduce flood risk and water pollution.
Using our simple tool, property owners can enter their addresses and discover which types of incentives are available in their area. Understanding the different funding options will allow property owners to move forward confidently to navigate the ins and outs of government programs.
The process of applying for any of these incentives is tedious and confusing. That is where Rainplan steps. in. We handle the heavy lifting of applying for grants and credits, complying with regulations, and hiring a reliable, trusted engineering and construction team to ensure the project is completed successfully for the best price. The first step however is to discover possible pathways for funding.

68,https://myrainplan.com/water-runoff-in-chesapeake-bay/,"How Tom Bulger Took Advantage of Rain Garden Incentives to Address Local Water Pollution
- Client: Tom Bulger
- Project: Rain Garden
- Geographic Area: Washington DC Metro Area
A conversation about environmental gravitas ends in a story about fraternity brothers returning a cadaver to a hospital before dawn. Thus is the intro to the wild ride that is Tom Bulger.
Mr. Bulger is a man whose resume carries a lot of prestige. He has been a Federal lobbyist for many years.
He serves on the board of WMATA (Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority), and he is the reason many counties received funding under initiatives like the Clean Water Act. Plus, he was the policy advisor to one of the most influential federal transportation commissions since the Clay Commission of the 1950s (which conceptualized and created the federal highway system).
Bulger is accomplished, yet humble, a man that even with his schedule still manages to make it to many West Virginia University (WVU) football games.
With an environmental policy and transportation background, it is not so surprising that Bulger and his wife are early adopters to stormwater management.
“The biggest motivational factor for my wife and me was the Chesapeake Bay Alliance,” says Bulger. “We have a connection there, and we’re fortunate enough to have a boat on the bay 7-9 months out of the year.”
Team Bulger are active participants in and around the Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the United States.
“We’re very involved in our marina in Eastport, Maryland. “But now I don’t go in the water anymore. After a big rainstorm or hurricane, you can even see a big plume in the Bay from space that depicts the pollution. People get infections.”
There are also economic concerns with the Bay’s water quality influencing local markets and restaurants.
“Crabs are scarce. Prices have tripled because the bay is dying in some places-the grass on the floor of the bay can’t hide the crabs”, says Bulger.”So there’s no place for the crabs to hide, and fish are eating and depleting the source.”
Concerns over economic and environmental impact, plus a desire to give his wife another area to garden in, led to Bulger contacting Rainplan to help him put in a rain garden on his property. A rain garden is a shallow dip in the ground with vegetation explicitly planted to help pull water back into the earth before running off into streets and drains.
“The long and short of it is that my wife has another garden. The idea that Rainplan would be our concierge and that they were working with Casey Trees, we were attracted by that,” says Bulger. (Casey Trees is a Washington DC-area nonprofit dedicated to restoring tree canopies and partners in completing rain gardens in the area).
Due to added curb appeal and comparatively easy installation, rain gardens have become a popular choice for water-conscious property owners. Yet, many property owners are either unaware of available incentives or the process of filing an application and finding the right contractor to complete the work is overwhelming.
“I had all of our neighbors come over to see our rain garden,” says Bulger. “I told them how inexpensive it was because we received $2,200 from the Bay Alliance [as an incentive package]. It was a no-brainer. It only cost us $700.”
Rainplan’s job is to make sure all incentive applications are filed and appropriate funding is offered, plus they find vetted contractors in the area to come place bids on the project—matching the owner to the best possible price. Essentially a one-stop spot for getting a stormwater project funded and completed.
“There’s so much on the internet now. So many emails and you don’t know what’s too good to be true,” says Bulger. “Rainplan does seem too good to be true, but I can’t say enough about it.”
With a rain garden installed on his property, Bulger can offset soil erosion that drains into a nearby creek-which then drains into the Chesapeake Bay. A simple step in addition to the work the Bulger family already does to protect their neighborhood’s environment.
“The rain garden came out wonderfully and it’s a really big addition. It makes the backyard look better and we aren’t losing our grass to erosion,” states Bulger. “Every little bit helps. There are a lot of young families in the Chevy Chase area, we’re surrounded by little kids and I know they get some curriculum in school about how the Bay impacts their lives.”
Over 150 rivers stream into the Chesapeake drainage basin. It’s home to archaeological sites such as shipwrecked canoes–it’s a piece of American history that also directly connects the economies of 6 neighboring states (New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, District of Columbia, and West Virginia).
Protecting the bay from landscape drainage is critical in preserving the livelihoods of these areas. Even small steps like a rain garden on Bulger’s gorgeous property can have a huge collective impact on the Bay’s watershed.

69,https://myrainplan.com/what-a-sustainable-society-would-emphasize/,"What is the Triple Bottom Line Concept and How Can Green Infrastructure Play a Role?
The Triple Bottom Line concept is a framework of what a sustainable society would emphasize meant to encourage businesses to consider their social, environmental and financial performance to drive increased commitment to sustainability. Making investments in green infrastructure is one of the top ways that businesses can address the 3P’s of the Triple Bottom Line – People, Planet and Profits.
Dreamed up by sustainability pioneer and environmentalist John Elkington in 1994, the “Triple Bottom Line” is an overarching belief that there should be more to success in business than just pure profits. Elkington’s set of principles are centered on the belief that a corporation or business should not measure success solely on the strength of their financials. According to Elkington’s new approach to corporate governance, financial, environmental and social metrics should be built into a company’s accounting system.
In the nearly three decades since Elkington introduced his ideas to the business community, there has been widespread buy-in by many of the largest corporations in the world and non-profits alike. There is no shortage of enthusiasm across all sectors of the global economy to get on board and commit to do what it takes to build a more sustainable future for the health of the planet. Boiled down to its core, the Triple Bottom Line is based on the principle that the impact to people and the environment as a byproduct of doing business should weight just as heavily into accounting and reporting metrics.
The Three ‘P’s of Sustainability
- People: What are the positive benefits and impacts of your business on your employees and their families? How does your business add value to its surrounding community and the people that live there? This is the measure of the way your business impacts every person that interacts with it. For example – a new restaurant in a small town could provide significant value to the community by creating jobs, a social gathering space and demand for food from local farmers.
- Planet: Is your business doing its part to keep our planet’s water and air clean? Are you spewing carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases into the air? How much water are you using? Are you doing anything to offset the negative impacts of your operations on the environment? For example, an intensive chemical manufacturing plant could seek to counteract their emissions by reducing their energy consumption by installing a solar farm, installing rain gardens and green infrastructure to limit runoff pollution and planting trees.
- Profit: Unfortunately, profit is often placed above people and planet in the grand scheme of things. It is important to generate a profit and contribute to the growth of the economy at the local, state and federal level, but the 3BL was created with more in mind.
Because maintaining a high level of profitability has the foremost focus of even the most aggressive adopters of the 3BL at the corporate level, Elkington is advocating for changes to his initial framework. Prosperity will replace profit in the revamped 3BL. Through this change, Elkington hopes to push businesses to focus more on a net accounting of their positive and negative impacts on the economy, environment and community, so that all are viewed on equal footing.
Interest in adopting the principles of the 3BL and committing to sustainability at a corporate level remains high. The know-how to implement sustainable practices or assess the “profitability” of green infrastructure projects is lacking within many companies who might have an enthusiasm or interest in the movement. This is where Rainplan can help.
What Does Sustain Mean
Founded with a mission to help further the adoption of green infrastructure for stormwater management, Rainplan’s role is helping businesses, developers and property owners wade through the often-confusing world of federal funding and government incentives for green projects. Funding is available to install many of the green infrastructure features that our clients are interested in, but tapping it can be confusing. Rainplan makes it possible to quickly secure funding, make a match with contractors, complete construction and start realizing the benefits of green infrastructure adoption.
Rainplan aims to be a part of the solution by acting as a central clearing house for stormwater greening projects. We help property owners and developers understand the incentives that are available to them and gain access to funding. Then, we work with contractors and engineers to bring the project to completion. All of the funding and work flows through Rainplan’s platform, ensuring that owners who want to go green get the best prices.
Green infrastructure projects have a huge bearing on a company’s Triple Bottom Line, especially when they are given a boost with government funding. The economic, social and environmental impacts of green infrastructure projects like green roofs, rain gardens, pervious pavers, tree planting and streetscapes are huge. We can start with the economic impacts, because at the end of the day, that’s what will get the most attention from the C-suite.
Green roofs can lower heating and cooling costs and save over $200,000 over a 40-year lifespan. On the environmental front, green roofs help with stormwater management by reducing runoff. A green roof can retain as much as 80% of rainfall, compared to under 25% for a standard roof. Green roofs also improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For social impacts, a well-designed green roof can become an outdoor gathering area for workers and neighbors.
Stormwater Management Strategies
Green roofs aren’t the only stormwater management strategies that can have an outsized impact on the 3BL. It has been proven that the presence of more green spaces can improve a community’s mental health and even reduce violent crime – it makes sense. Humans are wired to enjoy being in the outdoors and breathing fresh air. If that’s not enough reason to consider adding a large rain garden or urban forest to your development or business, there’s this – rental rates go up by as much as 7% with high-end landscaping and greening. Meanwhile, customers have been shown to be more willing to open their wallets at retail centers with tree cover and urban greenery.
Green infrastructure very clearly has a large impact to the three p’s of the Triple Bottom Line, and investment is a no-brainer for businesses looking to place an emphasis on sustainability. Stormwater greening projects can lead to a sizeable reduction in energy or water treatment costs, create beautiful, livable spaces for the community to gather and help to reduce water and air pollution.
At Rainplan, we are committed to helping our customers and clients follow through on their commitment to help make the world a cleaner, greener place. Our team is excited about the opportunities to work with the business community to realize the benefits of green infrastructure on multiple fronts and reach their profit goals within the Triple Bottom

70,https://myrainplan.com/what-are-stormwater-best-management-practices/,"Defining Stormwater BMPs
If you have ever worked with an engineer, you might be used to hearing the word drainage and the phrase stormwater best management practices. Often we have found that when clients start to dive into the world of design and structural planning, the terminology from experts in the field begins to confuse the process. In this article, I will focus on one phrase that is most commonly used, stormwater management best practices.
Best Management Practices
In 2019, the United Nations estimated that the United States had an urban population of more than 82 percent (around 268 million people). As urban environments expand, more buildings are built, and development progresses, the urban footprint expands. Generally, this footprint consists of concrete, asphalt, and building materials, most of which do not absorb water (impervious surfaces). Cities throughout the U.S. are combating urban flooding (or stormwater flooding) through various means. However, several best management practices-what often are shortened to BMPs-have been identified in helping to reduce flooding capacity.
What are BMPs and why do we use BMPs?
BMPs are common solutions to technical problems. These tools and technologies have been identified through tested means and are found to be the most effective at combating a particular issue. Stormwater issues impact individual properties differently in every environment (urban, suburban, and rural). However, the impact on a single property can vary significantly based on the amount of tree cover, impervious surface, or its location. For example, a property with minimal tree cover and no grass would be more susceptible to flooding during a severe rain event than a large, rural property with plenty of grass or a nearby ditch to transport it away. Rainwater craves permeable ground to flow down into, and often in urban environments, that is not practical. The rainwater often flows into either a Combined Sewer System (CSS) or Municipal Separate Stormwater System (MS4). BMPs offer an alternative to traditional methods of removing stormwater from an area.
Overview of BMP Technologies
Every property, like its owners, is different. From the challenges they face to the solutions that work best for them, every property has a different approach to managing stormwater. Below are some examples of stormwater management best practices found throughout the country.
Tree planting is a popular method for biofiltration
Biofiltration (Rain Gardens, Conservation Landscaping, Permeable Pavement)
- Biofiltration is achieved through many tools (e.g., permeable pavement, trees, rain gardens), but the paramount goal is to filter the stormwater that goes into it so that it is pollutant-free when it enters the ground. For example, rain gardens, a popular form of biofiltration, capture rainwater, usually through a gutter downspout, and filter out the harmful pollutants built up in the water content. But rain gardens do so much more than that. Rain gardens can increase the natural beauty of a yard, draw in more natural wildlife (which means more animals!), and preserve plant life that might otherwise go extinct.
Succulents are often used for green roof vegetation.
Green Roofs
- Green roofs are another popular tool for capturing rainwater on the roof directly and treating it before it reaches your home’s gutter system. For thousands of years of history, green roofs have been around in various formats worldwide. Modern-day green roofs are built on flat or low slope roofing and consist of thick, absorbent planting material that captures and treats rainwater. Green roofs are also great for insulation and beautifying your home.
Rainwater Harvesting (Cisterns + Rain Barrels)
- Harvesting rainwater that falls on your property is an excellent way to capture hundreds of gallons of water that would traditionally be lost to your municipal stormwater systems. Water is captured through a downspout connection to your gutter system and is stored in a tank system. Modern cisterns and rain barrels come in many varieties and designs to match every type of home design.
Stormwater Best Management Practice Manuals
For more in-depth knowledge on BMP practices concerning permitting and construction, sites will often utilize the local BMP Manual. Manuals list BMP guides for installing, maintaining, and other issues for managing stormwater pollution. The guides discuss each BMP and where they are best applicable for specific situations. These manuals will also list limitations, inspection requirements, and maintenance on a BMP. Stormwater management manuals are created by a variety of stakeholders and approved by permitting offices. Those who love a deep dive into what their engineer, contractor, or architect would be referencing can usually find these manuals online and listed on government websites. Here are some examples:
- North Carolina: https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/energy-mineral-and-land-resources/stormwater/stormwater-program/stormwater-design
- New Jersey: https://www.nj.gov/dep/stormwater/bmp_manual2.htm
- Minnesota: https://stormwater.pca.state.mn.us/index.php?title=Main_Page
It Starts With BMPs
Having a clear understanding of what water problems you face may be step one, but the solution starts with BMPs. When it comes to stormwater management, everything revolves around choosing and determining which BMP fits the property, soils, and needs of the property owner. For this reason, our team of Rainplanners uses a system of questions to determine where they need to meet you in your journey. Some property owners already know what BMPs they need, discussing plans with a contractor or engineer. They might be looking for us to help them find an incentive to offset their project costs. Other customers come in knowing very little about stormwater. Our goal is to educate and empower people to find a solution that benefits their bottom line, benefits their neighborhood, the local watershed, and can simultaneously beautify their property. The power of a BMP is that it maximizes value in every stormwater situation. Currently, we see many property owners interested in rain harvesting methods, green roofs in the DC area, and rain gardens are often a popular choice based on pricing, utility, and beautification for homeowners.
As Rainplanners we are dedicated to answering your questions and setting up a consultation call if you need more information.

71,https://myrainplan.com/what-are-stormwater-utility-fees/,"The Property Owners Guide to Stormwater Utility Fees
As a property owner, you might notice additional fees on your monthly utility bill. Stormwater fees are a new charge in over 2000 cities across America. In some municipalities, these fees are minimal, around $5-9 dollars a month. You might not even see stormwater charges on your utility bill! These charges are far higher for commercial real estate properties, so many developers have started to look for solutions to offset these costs. Whether you are a residential property owner or own commercial property, stormwater management is an investment that will pay for itself over time. Plus, you’ll benefit from helping the environment and establishing your place as a sustainable solution. Let’s do the math on how you can offset your stormwater utility fees.
What is a stormwater utility fee?
Stormwater utility fees are a fee that the government charges for managing stormwater. They are usually calculated by the square foot of impervious surface. Impervious surfaces are where water rolls off and collects contaminants carried off into public spaces and waterways. They create pollution runoff and hurt water quality. Areas such as parking lots, driveways, and roofs are taxed to cover the cost of managing stormwater with filters, cleanups, pipes, and other infrastructure.
Stormwater utility bills are usually sent out quarterly or annually, depending on what type of plan your city has in place. Depending on your area, you might see these fees listed under property taxes, or for those of you in Pennsylvania; it’s called stormwater authority fees. Both tax and non-tax properties are required to pay these fees. These bills also include other services such as trash pick-up, snow removal, and recycling services.
Do I have stormwater management in my area?
If you don’t live near a significant watershed area or in a rural area, or most of your rain falls onto actual soil–you’ll likely never see a stormwater drainage bill. Stormwater management happens in urban and dense regions where growing development adds in additional hardscapes that contribute to water runoff. Cities that depend on local waterways like lakes, rivers, bays, and oceans will in the future (if they don’t already) have a stormwater drainage utility. Urbanization does not show any signs of stopping. For cities to upkeep stormwater and combined sewer systems, imposing a yearly fee is the only way to fund the future. Cities like Washington DC, Chicago, Detroit, and Philadelphia already have stormwater utilities. The EPA has programs to help local governments set up their utility system and you can read about it here.
How are Stormwater Charges Calculated
Commercial buildings take up more surface space and contribute to more water runoff than your typical residential home. If you happen to be a commercial property owner, you likely are getting charged more based on your concrete surfaces. Suppose you’re on residential property and have a pool, large patio or deck, or an accessory dwelling unit (like a separate garage or apartment). In that case, your stormwater fees will be higher.
The average stormwater fee in the United States is $12 billed quarterly, so around $48 a year for a residential property.
That’s a small amount of money per year; even over ten years, it’s not much, so why should I care?
Investing Wisely in Stormwater Management
Stormwater management is a significant issue in many cities. It can cost a lot of money to clean up the water and repair the damage that has been done. Green infrastructure is one solution that can save money and make things better for the environment. If private property owners all implemented some stormwater retention best practice, it would significantly help the local economy and save the neighborhood money in the long term. Plus, over time, any property owner who implements green infrastructure on their land will save money while helping to build a sustainable ecosystem and healthy environment.
Green infrastructure includes rain gardens, rain barrels, and other ways of collecting water runoff. The benefits of these green solutions are many: they are cheaper than traditional methods, are environmentally friendly, and can be used in conjunction with other stormwater management methods.
Example: If you live in Washington DC and have a small row home, your yearly charge for stormwater is likely around $50. Over ten years, you would have paid $500. However, if you purchase a rain barrel, your fees will be lowered, and the barrel itself is only $80. So you will have paid for the barrel within two years, and. Then be saving money for the next 8. Even better, through a stormwater incentive program, you can be reimbursed for the rain barrel making the entire retrofit a free project, and start saving instantly on stormwater utilities.
You can save thousands each year for commercial property owners after upgrading to a stormwater management practice like bioswales or permeable pavers. (If you add in a green roof, you save on utilities, energy bills, and more, thus maximizing your investment)
Stormwater Drainage Is a Long Game
The keen property owner knows that investing is a long game. You might not see the financial benefits immediately from installing green infrastructure-although you’ll see the maintenance benefits within the first rain event. Over time, you save money from purchasing and installing green infrastructure in your yard, parking lot, roof, etc. You’ll especially be able to save if you apply for a stormwater incentive program that will pay you back for your project costs.

72,https://myrainplan.com/what-is-a-rain-garden/,"What is a Rain Garden?
A rain garden, also known as a rainwater garden or bioswale, is a type of green infrastructure designed to manage stormwater runoff or what you might call “rain drainage.” It has a shallow depression, where surface water accumulates and gets filtered. The rainwater then slowly seeps into the ground, which helps in reducing flooding, pollution, and erosion.
You can construct a rain garden in any area with sufficient space for the water runoff to collect and a slope that allows for drainage. A rain garden also works by diverting or slowing down stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces such as roofs, driveways, or parking lots. This can be done by planting vegetation such as grasses or shrubs around the perimeter of the structures where runoff typically collects.
How does it Work?
Rain gardens are a great way to control water runoff and reduce the amount of polluted stormwater that reaches the ocean or other water bodies. They also provide habitat for wildlife, such as frogs and dragonflies, which are in danger of extinction due to the loss of wetland areas.
As we stated before, a rain garden is usually a shallow depression (in basic terms, a shallow excavated hole) in the ground that is filled with plants, rocks, and soil. Its primary purpose is to collect the water runoff from higher elevated areas and pull that water back into the ground before it leaves the property. The soil types will vary depending on where you live, but most rain gardens have a layer of sand or gravel at the bottom to help soak up and filter out pollutants. The plants in a rain garden will also vary depending on your climate, but they need to be able to withstand heavy rainfall, so nothing too delicate.
What are the Benefits of a Rain Garden?
There are numerous benefits to a rain garden, hence their popularity among property owners in both the spring and fall.
- A rain garden is a low-cost property project. Compared to other property projects like pavers, patios, and green roofs, a rain garden is far less expensive. Anywhere from $2,000-$10k.
- It can help curb water pollution. We already talked about this above, but the main component of a rainwater garden is that it can stop water pollution in your area by naturally filtering out chemicals through rock minerals and plant respiration cycles. Water runoff is the #1 cause of pollution in US Waterways.
- Rain gardens are also a great way to improve your home’s curb appeal! They provide a natural buffer between the street and the house, creating a more welcoming entrance.
- Create a space for pollinators-or don’t. Pollinators such as bats, bees, and butterflies struggle to survive in urban environments. They need flowers and water to stay alive and pollinate. Having a space for them to take a quick sip of water and pollinate is excellent for the environment and could be beneficial for other property plant life. Not a fan of bees? There are plenty of plants you can that will limit attraction.
- Nourish your property soil. Rain gardens pull water into your soils, mineral runoff, and plant contribution, which can help nourish your soils on site—an excellent way to start preparing for even more planting and soil relocation in the future.
What’s a Rain Garden Design?
The best way to design a rain garden is to consult with an expert in this field. You probably expected that response, and you aren’t jazzed about paying a contractor. Still, designing and building a rain garden is more than digging a hole and planting. The slope of your yard and soils heavily determine your rain garden. You DON’T want to purchase items only to discover that your rain garden isn’t helping control water runoff on your property.
A specialized contractor or landscape artist will help you with all design aspects, including what plants will work best for your local climate and soil conditions. Gardens can be designed in many different ways and can be as big or small as you want them to help maintain your costs and maintenance concerns.
Rain gardens are typically planted with native, water-loving plants that tolerate wet soil. These plants include sedges, rushes, and grasses. Depending on the size of your garden, they can also have rock designs and wood chips to help prevent flooding. More extensive rain gardens also can consist of small trees which do the heavy lifting in terms of soaking up water in flooded areas.
Here’s one of our favorite infographics about Rain Gardens:

73,https://myrainplan.com/what-is-stormwater/,"What is Stormwater & Why Does the Government Care about It?
Stormwater drainage is a massive topic in 2022. As more severe weather patterns emerge, governments are focusing on declining infrastructure. We often don’t think about it, but the United States is a young nation compared to other countries. Yet, our gray infrastructure is starting to encounter growing pains with stormwater with aging cities. The definition of stormwater, of course, is water from rain events and snowmelt that runoffs off the land. This article will break down how our local governments plan to empower communities to help assist in stormwater drainage issues.
Where does Stormwater Go?
Stormwater management starts with gray infrastructure, the systems engineered on public property. Gray infrastructure gets a lot of attention because of the grave importance of its utility. Massive public storm drains move water away from properties to prevent damage. Our taxes help pay for these systems to keep us environmentally and economically healthy.
Over time, as cities continue to grow to fit the needs of more and more residents, more hardscapes have popped up. We need more surface space for buildings, roads, and sidewalks. This concrete makes water runoff flow faster, and at higher velocity into stormwater drains. With more water entering drainage systems, there is pressure on plans to keep up with water flow. In systems with high overflow, contaminated water can move out into streets and local waterways. This can make people sick from viral and bacterial infections. The concern for public health, environment and economic growth has led local cities to seek ways to offset water runoff.
What is Stormwater Management?
In the 70s, it became clear that pollution was a growing problem. (Air pollution was 5x worse in the 1970s than today.) A growing public concern led President Nixon to declare his intent to work on pollution control during his term. This was also during the time of the “flower child.” Progressive environmental thought on college campuses was influencing government agendas.
When faced with growing environmental problems, stormwater management was one area that became a necessity for engineering and regulation. Municipal programs were to receive more financing, and with money came code to make sure funds were appropriately used. For stormwater, this all started in 1973 with the Clean Water Act.
The Clean Water Act and NPDES
The Clean Water Act was passed during the LBJ presidency. This legislation penalized water point sources that were polluting waterways. Unless the point source had a permit from the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), in that case, the polluter wouldn’t be penalized. So, for example, a shopping mall could file for a permit from the NPDES if they know that their property has a lot of water runoff each year. In 1973, the U.S. EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) started to exempt some stormwater dischargers from permitting requirements. Except in cases where significant pollution was happening.
With the start of stormwater management in the 70s, states took on managing and enforcing the rules of NPDES. Most states place fees and taxes on large polluters through the State Water Board. While oversight and regulation of significant stormwater runoff drainage help keep ecosystems steady, growing demands were outpacing law and infrastructure. So the government had to start getting creative.
Stormwater Retention and Green Infrastructure
Federal and state agencies decided to approach stormwater drainage by adding two methods. The first is stormwater utility fees, using taxes from these fees to help pay for infrastructure upgrades. The other is stormwater retention methods. Instead of gray infrastructure, the government looked towards “green infrastructure,” which focuses on recreating natural solutions-nature-based solutions- to help filter out pollutants. Green infrastructure regarding stormwater meant building technologies that would redirect water traffic. For example, instead of using traditional asphalt, using concrete was porous and would let more water seep into the ground. Or using specific downspouts on homes that would move water into certain areas. If retention on a property wasn’t possible, stormwater technologies like bioswales help water flow off-site. Municipalities receiving funds made sure to set aside a budget to help property owners use stormwater infrastructure technologies.
Your City Wants You to Use Stormwater Incentives
The most reliable way to get people motivated is to incentivize them with economic rewards—especially property owners who know and need a break in costs on property repairs or upgrades. Stormwater incentive programs fluctuate each year and are usually carried out by city programs and nonprofits. These incentive programs reward property owners who upgrade to green infrastructure by giving them a rebate to pay for some building costs, lowering stormwater utility fees, and other methods.
Our federal, state, and local governments emphasize stormwater runoff because they know the impact of water runoff on the economy (property damage claims, loss of food from contamination), the environment, and public health. We all live in an ecosystem that is dependent on many factors, and water is an intricate part of the system.
Where You Can Find Incentives
The trick to stormwater incentives is knowing where to apply for them and what you will need in place to get approved. Rainplan was created in 2019 for this very purpose. Our goal is to provide you with a free service that connects you with local incentive programs. These programs are specific to your property, and we also set up a dashboard for you to learn more and get notified of when these programs open up for applications.
To apply for a stormwater incentive, you’ll need specific project paperwork, and you’ll need to be on their waiting list of participants. Rainplan makes the stress of bureaucracy easier by filing and handling large stormwater incentive applications for you. We give you a Rainplan checklist, help you find a contractor, and lead you on the path towards receiving your incentive.",stormwater government care stormwater drainage massive topic severe weather patterns emerge governments focusing declining infrastructure often think united states young nation compared countries yet gray infrastructure starting encounter growing pains stormwater aging cities definition stormwater course water rain events snowmelt runoffs land article break local governments plan empower communities help assist stormwater drainage issues stormwater go stormwater management starts gray infrastructure systems engineered public property gray infrastructure gets lot attention grave importance utility massive public storm drains move water away properties prevent damage taxes help pay systems keep us environmentally economically healthy time cities continue grow fit needs residents hardscapes popped need surface space buildings roads sidewalks concrete makes water runoff flow faster higher velocity stormwater drains water entering drainage systems pressure plans keep water flow systems high overflow contaminated water move streets local waterways make people sick viral bacterial infections concern public health environment economic growth led local cities seek ways offset water runoff stormwater management 70s became clear pollution growing problem air pollution 5x worse 1970s today growing public concern led president nixon declare intent work pollution control term also time flower child progressive environmental thought college campuses influencing government agendas faced growing environmental problems stormwater management one area became necessity engineering regulation municipal programs receive financing money came code make sure funds appropriately used stormwater started clean water act clean water act npdes clean water act passed lbj presidency legislation penalized water point sources polluting waterways unless point source permit national pollution discharge elimination system npdes case polluter penalized example shopping mall could file permit npdes know property lot water runoff year u epa environmental protection agency started exempt stormwater dischargers permitting requirements except cases significant pollution happening start stormwater management 70s states took managing enforcing rules npdes states place fees taxes large polluters state water board oversight regulation significant stormwater runoff drainage help keep ecosystems steady growing demands outpacing law infrastructure government start getting creative stormwater retention green infrastructure federal state agencies decided approach stormwater drainage adding two methods first stormwater utility fees using taxes fees help pay infrastructure upgrades stormwater retention methods instead gray infrastructure government looked towards green infrastructure focuses recreating natural solutions nature based solutions help filter pollutants green infrastructure regarding stormwater meant building technologies would redirect water traffic example instead using traditional asphalt using concrete porous would let water seep ground using specific downspouts homes would move water certain areas retention property possible stormwater technologies like bioswales help water flow site municipalities receiving funds made sure set aside budget help property owners use stormwater infrastructure technologies city wants use stormwater incentives reliable way get people motivated incentivize economic rewards especially property owners know need break costs property repairs upgrades stormwater incentive programs fluctuate year usually carried city programs nonprofits incentive programs reward property owners upgrade green infrastructure giving rebate pay building costs lowering stormwater utility fees methods federal state local governments emphasize stormwater runoff know impact water runoff economy property damage claims loss food contamination environment public health live ecosystem dependent many factors water intricate part system find incentives trick stormwater incentives knowing apply need place get approved rainplan created purpose goal provide free service connects local incentive programs programs specific property also set dashboard learn get notified programs open applications apply stormwater incentive need specific project paperwork need waiting list participants rainplan makes stress bureaucracy easier filing handling large stormwater incentive applications give rainplan checklist help find contractor lead path towards receiving incentive
74,https://myrainplan.com/xeriscaping-on-a-budget/,"Drought-resistant landscaping is the new American culture, and many look for ways to start xeriscaping on a budget. Some might find it hard to give up the “lush green yard.” Universities, churches, and commercial buildings like cozy curb appeal and presentation can help sell a message, introduce a persona to your business, and demonstrate commitment to conservation. Still, as more cities adopt stormwater utility fees, higher water bills, and water restrictions, it makes perfect sense for property owners to transition to sustainable landscaping designs. Can this get pricey? Yes. However, we show you ways to incorporate stormwater incentives to make your xeriscaping on a budget a doable process.
What is xeriscaping?
Water restrictions are necessary to maintain neighborhood resilience, with year-long droughts hitting many areas. Xeriscaping cuts down on watering and lawn maintenance by eliminating plant life that demands more watering. Xeriscaping design ideas include removing grass areas in a yard and replacing them with rock designs, different soils, and native plants that retain water.
Xeriscaping Design Ideas
Xeriscaping often comes with the connotation that you are taking a lawn and turning it into cacti and rock situation. While this might be fitting and stunning in areas like Arizona and Utah, you may not want that particular southwest aesthetic. Not to worry, there are many different types of plants for xeriscaping. The concept doesn’t have to be succulents or cacti but merely native plants that can withstand drought.
Sustainable landscaping doesn’t have to mean ripping out all of your grass. You can find ways to incorporate rock, mulch, and grass and still manage your watering needs and even stormwater runoff.
The Benefits of Xeriscaping
Xeriscaping is a level of sustainable landscaping that can include xeriscape plants to attract pollinators, prevent water runoff (and, in return, water pollution), add minerals to soils, and still resale curb value. The number one benefit of a xeriscaped yard is its low maintenance costs. This helps save on any maintenance needed for erosion, foundation cracks, etc. Of course, xeriscaping can save water! These lawns take less watering and, with specific designs, can prevent water damage and water pooling in a yard.
The Disadvantages of Xeriscaping
The main disadvantage of xeriscaping is that it might not meet your desired look. People love green lawns. Seeing certain lush plants and flowers as you walk into your office can make you happy and cheerful. Xeriscaping is a different approach to landscape design, and adjusting to a new setting might not be on the top of your list.
The other disadvantage is that taking your yard from grassy to rocky can get very expensive! On average, a xeriscaped 1200 sq ft yard is around $18000. Of course, it depends on the work you want, the yard size, if you hire a designer, your contractor, etc. Still, this price point is enough to turn many property owners away, but there are specific things you can do to reduce the costs of xeriscaping your property.
Xeriscaping on a Budget
Xeriscaping designs can incorporate stormwater management practices like dry creeks, bioretention, rain gardens, and permeable pavers. Using green infrastructure in your project means you likely qualify for a local incentive program to pay you back for incorporating these sustainable practices. You can use our search engine to find a designer, contractor, and incentive program! We will show you local incentive programs based on the technologies you plan on using. (We’re also the only place only with this type of database.) or maybe you want to look at ideas and understand them better. Either way, using our incentive match search engine can get you started.
Xeriscaping Using Stormwater Incentives
Let’s break down what projects you can include in your property design to get your money back.
Dry Creeks
Dry creeks can be used to build pathways and spirals in your design. While there are no specific incentive programs for dry creeks, dry creeks are usually included in landscaping with rain gardens, bioswales, or replacements for removing pavement (all of which have incentive programs to back them up).
Rain Gardens/Bio Retention/Natural Landscaping
Incentive programs for “natural landscaping” are growing across the US. The benefits of using native plants are that they require less water because they are already adaptable to the climate. Plus, they attract pollinators and help cross-pollinate and produce a healthy ecosystem. When xeriscaping, you are including natural and native landscaping so you can qualify (depending on some restrictions) for rebates or grants.
Another method to help pay for your xeriscaping project is removing pavement or installing permeable pavers. There are incentive programs that will pay you back or lower your stormwater utility bill if you remove hardscapes (pavements like asphalt and concrete) from your yard.
If digging up your soils and implementing new plants is not for you, considering paving over and creating patio areas, consider doing it with permeable pavers. For one, permeable pavers last longer than traditional patio materials. Second, if it ever does rain, these pavers soak the water back into your landscape, helping to strengthen your soils and stop pooling in your area.
When creating a drought-resistant landscape, yes, it can be pricey. In the long term, there is less maintenance, property damage, and water runoff, and these types of projects CAN be paid for by being creative with stormwater incentives.
Not sure what incentives are offered in your area? Type in your property to search for what is available to you. Also, keep in mind incentive programs have open application dates and can run out of money depending on demand. You want to be proactive about applying, and we can help guide you along the way if you create your free Rainplan.",drought resistant landscaping new american culture many look ways start xeriscaping budget might find hard give lush green yard universities churches commercial buildings like cozy curb appeal presentation help sell message introduce persona business demonstrate commitment conservation still cities adopt stormwater utility fees higher water bills water restrictions makes perfect sense property owners transition sustainable landscaping designs get pricey yes however show ways incorporate stormwater incentives make xeriscaping budget doable process xeriscaping water restrictions necessary maintain neighborhood resilience year long droughts hitting many areas xeriscaping cuts watering lawn maintenance eliminating plant life demands watering xeriscaping design ideas include removing grass areas yard replacing rock designs different soils native plants retain water xeriscaping design ideas xeriscaping often comes connotation taking lawn turning cacti rock situation might fitting stunning areas like arizona utah may want particular southwest aesthetic worry many different types plants xeriscaping concept succulents cacti merely native plants withstand drought sustainable landscaping mean ripping grass find ways incorporate rock mulch grass still manage watering needs even stormwater runoff benefits xeriscaping xeriscaping level sustainable landscaping include xeriscape plants attract pollinators prevent water runoff return water pollution add minerals soils still resale curb value number one benefit xeriscaped yard low maintenance costs helps save maintenance needed erosion foundation cracks etc course xeriscaping save water lawns take less watering specific designs prevent water damage water pooling yard disadvantages xeriscaping main disadvantage xeriscaping might meet desired look people love green lawns seeing certain lush plants flowers walk office make happy cheerful xeriscaping different approach landscape design adjusting new setting might top list disadvantage taking yard grassy rocky get expensive average xeriscaped sq ft yard around course depends work want yard size hire designer contractor etc still price point enough turn many property owners away specific things reduce costs xeriscaping property xeriscaping budget xeriscaping designs incorporate stormwater management practices like dry creeks bioretention rain gardens permeable pavers using green infrastructure project means likely qualify local incentive program pay back incorporating sustainable practices use search engine find designer contractor incentive program show local incentive programs based technologies plan using also place type database maybe want look ideas understand better either way using incentive match search engine get started xeriscaping using stormwater incentives let break projects include property design get money back dry creeks dry creeks used build pathways spirals design specific incentive programs dry creeks dry creeks usually included landscaping rain gardens bioswales replacements removing pavement incentive programs back rain gardens bio retention natural landscaping incentive programs natural landscaping growing across us benefits using native plants require less water already adaptable climate plus attract pollinators help cross pollinate produce healthy ecosystem xeriscaping including natural native landscaping qualify depending restrictions rebates grants another method help pay xeriscaping project removing pavement installing permeable pavers incentive programs pay back lower stormwater utility bill remove hardscapes pavements like asphalt concrete yard digging soils implementing new plants considering paving creating patio areas consider permeable pavers one permeable pavers last longer traditional patio materials second ever rain pavers soak water back landscape helping strengthen soils stop pooling area creating drought resistant landscape yes pricey long term less maintenance property damage water runoff types projects paid creative stormwater incentives sure incentives offered area type property search available also keep mind incentive programs open application dates run money depending demand want proactive applying help guide along way create free rainplan

Overview
Rain is the single largest cause of water pollution, flooding, and property damage impacting over 200 million people in the US today. This has led to federal mandates that put pressure on local governments and private property owners. Local governments only have access to 20% of the land use in a given urban market, requiring them to come up with ways to incentivize private property owners to retrofit their properties. While incentive programs exist they are hard to find, complicated, and time-consuming which leads to extremely low utilization rates.
Using Rainplan, Yellow Enterprises located at 1336 Bladensburg Ave Washington, DC 20002 was able to benefit from local incentives available to property owners within the City to upgrade their parking lot with a bio-retention “rain garden” facility that treats approximately 39K gallons of water per the first inch of rain. Rainplan matched Yellow Enterprises with (2) incentive programs for a total value of $115+K. Yellow Enterprise’s participation didn’t require any out-of-pocket expenditures or construction delivery risk. The only requirement of Yellow Enterprises as the “Host” for the green infrastructure improvement was to allow property access for the installation and long-term maintenance of the installed rain garden.
Greening Urban is a local, DC-based, design, engineering, and construction management firm led by Chris Early that was matched by Rainplan to this project as the “Producer.” As the Producer, Greening Urban is responsible for the installation, certification, and maintenance of the installed green infrastructure device to ensure it is within compliance and functionality of the local incentive programs requirements. Through the Rainplan platform, Greening Urban was successful in sourcing the upfront funding to proceed with the installation and management of the installed infrastructure.
Approach
There’s a general proactive lack of participation with stormwater management by private property owners and a need for digitization of available incentive programs offered by incentive providers. Private Property Owners are unaware of the incentives, value, and benefits of optimal stormwater management on their properties.
The lack of awareness around available incentives, and the impact of stormwater compliance on private property ownership involves highly complicated technologies, non-digitized incentive application processes, and 180 day incentive payout periods that are significant barriers to increasing private property owners’ participation with local stormwater retrofits.
Rainplan’s objective is to digitize the available incentive programs into one single consolidated platform and match those incentives to the private properties to create high impact stormwater projects that increase value for private property owners, increase the utilization of available incentive programs, and ultimately improve the local water quality and flooding impacts in highly urban communities.
Results
- Matched (2) incentive programs
- $115K in tangible value to the property owner.
- Sourced $310k in funding for design and construction
- ~40K gallons of stormwater treatment capacity through green infrastructure.
