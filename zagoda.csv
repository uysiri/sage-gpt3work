5,https://zagodaoliveoil.com/blogs/olive-oil-health/should-we-all-be-drinking-olive-oil,"A lot of us already use olive oil as our primary cooking oil, mainly for its taste and nutritional value. Extra virgin olive oil has so many benefits that we’ve gathered our top reasons why you should drink it every day!
What? Drink olive oil?! It may sound strange at first, but in many countries olive oil is considered a medicine used both in food or ingested on its own. The oil by itself retains its health benefits the best as opposed to mixing it with food. Start small with a tablespoon, and you can up the dose to 2 or more tablespoons. You can even add a dash of lemon juice to enhance the flavor!
Here are some reasons why you should drink extra virgin olive oil every day!
It Can Strengthen the Immune System
Our immune system is under attack everyday from viral and bacterial infections. Olive oil, by chance, has the highest concentration of antioxidants and monounsaturated fats that have anti-inflammatory properties. Drinking olive oil daily provides a boost in pathogen fighting cells to help the immune system function efficiently.
It Helps Lower Blood Sugar
The monounsaturated fatty acids found in EVOO help lower blood sugar levels more than all other types of cooking oils. It naturally produces much needed insulin, which is a key hormone that controls blood sugar levels. This is why olive oil is an important supplement for people who have type 2 diabetes.
Olive Oil Supports a Healthy Heart
There’s newer research showing that people who consume more than half a tablespoon of premium extra virgin olive oil daily, have less chances of developing cardiovascular problems and coronary diseases. Oleic acid, one of the many types of unsaturated acids in olive oil, helps regulate heart health. But one important piece of advice is to replace all other fat sources with olive oil: doing so will make sure that you are not consuming too much fatty food which can reverse the benefits of olive oil.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil Can Help Liver Detox
Our body’s liver has several primary functions: vitamin storage, blood detoxification, fat metabolization, plasma protein synthesis, enzyme activation, cholesterol and bile excretion. The consumption of extra virgin olive oil on a daily basis will help these functions perform more efficiently. Olive oil acts as a “natural laxative” for the liver which helps it release more bile. This aids the liver in releasing stored toxins, making extra virgin olive oil great for liver detox. This process also helps reduce the fat deposits inside the liver, which helps tremendously for diets that address a fatty liver.
Polyphenols in Olive Oil Improve Brain Power
While mental disorders cannot be simply cured by drinking cooking oils, the polyphenols and antioxidants present in olive oils can maintain a healthy brain. More recent studies are coming out that show a higher correlation between brain health and quantity of olive oil consumption. This ability to help keep the brain in a safe and functioning state may prevent diseases such as Alzheimer's and depression.
Optimum Daily Intake of Fatty Acids
According to the US Food and Drug Administration: a recommended daily intake of 17.5 grams of monounsaturated fatty acids. Extra virgin olive oil contains that amount of fatty acids in about 1.5 tablespoons, making an efficient way to get your daily intake! You can also have a small boost to your daily intake, so a half tablespoon will also suffice.
Beautiful Skin, Hair & Nails
Extra virgin olive oil has been used as a beauty aid for over a millennia. Hair, skin, nails and bones can all benefit from a daily dose of olive oil in our diets. But external application of oil can also aid with beauty, such as repairing damaged hair and nails; it can even act as a skin moisturizer!
Anti-inflammatory Properties
The most effective anti-inflammatory compound, oleocanthal, is only found in olive oil. This compound has the ability to prevent, reduce and relive most inflammation. It inhibits the enzymes COX-1 and COX-2 that promote inflammation, much like how ibuprofen does. Various studies have shown that people who consistently drink olive oil have lower body inflammation and higher bone density.
Helps the Digestive System
Olive Oil can help protect and restore the mucus lining of the colon from passing hard stools. Most people drink a tablespoon of olive oil on an empty stomach, which aids in relieving chronic constipation. By doing that, the colon gets its relief because the stool becomes softer and moves more easily throughout the colon. This is one critical factor in proper digestive health, and is a natural remedy that is more effective than traditional laxatives.
It Can Help Lose Weight
Extra virgin olive oil has the ability to increase the sensation of fullness. This is achieved by the high levels of serotonin present in the oil, and coupled with the aromatic properties, can help people eat less and lose weight! But it is important to realize that consuming daily olive oil might increase your overall caloric intake, since a tablespoon of olive oil can contain about 119 calories. To achieve the best weight loss results. Its best to replace other fats in your diet with olive oil.
Many people in the Mediterranean use olive oil very liberally in their daily diets, however, its important to note that moderate use of olive oil will help achieve the oils greatest benefits. You must keep in mind that a daily dose of olive oil has to be done with a balanced diet; too much monounsaturated fatty acids can have the opposite effects. Moderation and balance are key to having a healthy diet.
In the end, always do your own research, especially when it involves your health."

7,https://zagodaoliveoil.com/blogs/recipes-1/eggplant-tomato-stew,"The eggplant is one of the most versatile vegetables anyone can use for home cooking. It can be the sole star of the dish for vegan or vegetarian cooks; or it can be stewed with meat and other vegetables. Eggplant has the extraordinary tendency to soak up any flavor it is cooked in which means that stews and soups are optimal. Our favorite way to eat eggplant is prepared in a simple stew. We recommend dipping bread into the leftover juices to taste the olive oil mixed in with the flavors of the delicious vegetables!
Ingredients:
2 Tbsp Zagoda extra virgin olive oil
2 cubed medium eggplants
1 small, diced onion
4 minced garlic cloves
1/2 tsp chili flakes
1 3/4 cups crushed tomatoes
Salt and black pepper
1 tsp dried oregano
Fresh herbs like basil, cilantro, dill, or parsley
Place cubed eggplants into a bowl or colander and salt generously. Let it stand for 20-30 minutes. Once the eggplant starts to sweat, pat dry with a paper towel.
Heat the olive oil in a pan over medium heat and add the eggplant. Cover the pan with a lid and simmer the eggplant until soft and golden brown, stirring occasionally. Once cooked, put them aside on a plate. Depending on the size of the pan, you can do it in batches until all the eggplant is cooked.
Add the diced onion into the same pan, adding more oil if needed, with a pinch of salt. Cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic, dried oregano, and chili flakes. Stir to combine.
Put the eggplant back in, along with the crushed tomatoes. Cover with a lid, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 15 minutes. Serve the stew in a soup plate or bowl. Sprinkle the herbs before serving.
Enjoy this delicious Mediterranean-inspired stew with your favorite bread!"

Our olive oil begins its process at our farm in the small village of Köprübaşı, Turkey, and we harvest our olives early and pick them by hand one by one. They are then carefully pressed cold under 27 °C (80 °F) without any chemical processing, additives, or preservatives. It contains high amounts of polyphenols and antioxidants that transform into taste characteristics of “fruitiness, bitterness and pungency”.

20,https://zagodaoliveoil.com/pages/faq,"FAQ
Why choose Extra Virgin?
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) is considered the purest form of any type of olive oil. When the olive is a luminescent green, our olives are handpicked and pressed on the first day of that harvest. This is a crucial first step because it helps retain the olives' low acidity (.08%), pungent taste, and high polyphenol content.
Every shopper should always select “Extra Virgin” when planning to cook with olive oil or when adding it as a condiment for salads and sides. The added health benefits and diverse flavors of EVOO make it a must have for any gourmet foodie or health-conscious shopper!
What is Ultra-Premium?
Ultra-Premium (UP) is a new olive oil category that defines the best quality olive oil in the world.
The UP standard was created in response to the growing need to distinguish high-quality extra virgin olive oils from those that dominate the so-called ""gourmet"" and ""premium"" olive oil markets, as well as the broader category sold in mass markets under thousands of brands and private labels.
The UP standard is reserved for the world's best extra virgin olive oils. As such, the UP grade exceeds all existing European, Italian, Spanish, Greek, North American and Californian standards for the grade known as extra virgin olive oil. To qualify for the UP class, extra virgin olive oil must meet or exceed a comprehensive set of production, storage, transportation, testing, chemistry and organoleptic requirements.
Extra Virgin Olive Oils are graded according to their acidity levels. The following types are available:
Ultra-Premium Extra Virgin Olive Oil is a new category of olive oil, even less acidic (less than 0.3%) and considered a finishing oil. It leaves a clean and fresh taste on the palate.
Premium Extra Virgin Olive Oil will have a bright, vibrant color with a balance of fruitiness, bitterness and hardness and will be less acidic (less than 0.5%).
Natural Extra Virgin Olive Oil is made from cold pressing of olives without any additional heat, refining or processing. With an acidity of not more than 0.8%, it is generally used not for cooking, but for dipping, drizzling and salad dressings.
What are Polyphenols?
Polyphenols are naturally occurring compounds found in plant foods. They act like an antioxidant; they neutralize any type of harmful agents that can damage a person’s cells. Daily consumption of polyphenol-rich foods can help prevent certain long-term chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease.
Extra virgin olive oil is one of the most valuable sources of polyphenols. It carries the highest concentration of polyphenols compared to any other cooking oil. The highest amounts of phenolic components are observed in the olives that are in their semi-green period, which makes them extra virgin. This is why the olives that are harvested while they have a bright green color contain the highest amounts of polyphenols, compared to the darker ones.
The process of the olive turning into olive oil must not involve any sort of chemical element during extraction. Cheaper store-bought olive oils use chemicals during pressing that can remove the polyphenols, and thus removing any health benefit from the oil while also reducing the natural taste of the olive oil. Polyphenols improve the taste of the oil and also help with the longevity of the oil. Other seed oils that use a chemical process to extract the oil remove polyphenols, making the oil tasteless; and by adding preservatives, they can artificially extend the shelf life of their oil. It is extremely important to consider what exactly goes into the process of making the many oils that people use every day for their cooking needs.
Why are the olives hand-picked?
We hand pick because it is the healthiest harvesting method for both the olives and the trees they grow on.
Shaking the tree to harvest olives is a very common method, usually producing between 220-260 lbs per worker per day. It is very efficient and cost effective but degrades the quality of the olives. Now for hand picking, this amount drops to 130-150 lbs per worker per day but preserves the quality of the olives because the skin of the olives will not be torn or crushed during shaking. By squeezing the olives where the stem of the branch and the olive meet, it actually protects the oil in the fruit from becoming too acidic and retains its polyphenol content.
Of course, this method of hand-picking does have its drawbacks such as higher production costs; but it is required when you are harvesting Ultra-Premium EVOO!
The olives are then loaded onto perforated crates that keep the olives cool, and rapidly transported to the pressing machines on the SAME day to be extracted for their precious oil.
What does ""early harvest"" mean?
It means harvesting during the color transformation phase of the olive fruit or just before it. The early harvested fruit contains more antioxidants, and the quality of the olive oil is increased. However, oil yield is low at this stage. As the olives age, the amount of oil in the fruit increases; however, the number of antioxidants decreases. Therefore, we have to make our choice: quality, or quantity? Quality means olive oil with high polyphenols, a high health component. 33 fl oz of olive oil can be extracted from 6-11 lb of late harvested olives, but it would require 17-22 lb of early harvested olives to extract the same amount of oil. Therefore, the price of early harvest olive oil is always higher.
What does ""cold pressed"" mean?
It means that the temperature of the olive paste in the kneader is equal to or lower than 78°F while producing olive oil. You can find the information about a specific product from the people who produce the olive oil, or from the label on the bottles.
What does ""unfiltered"" mean?
It is fresh olive oil that has a cloudy appearance, because it has not been filtered. The organic residue is actually the skin, flesh and seed of the olive, making it denser in terms of fruitiness. It is not an indication of lower quality or spoilage.
Since olive oil’s shelf life should only be about 2 years, the organic matter in the oil is meant to lose quality over time. To help keep the highest benefits and the premium quality of the oil, it is recommended that it is consumed within 2-3 months."

Product details:
Size (each): 16.9 oz (500 ml)
Polyphenols (mg/kg): 368.60mg
Acidity: 0.10%
Harvest date: 10/15/2021
Our Arbequina is one of the lighter oils we offer. Its content is very buttery and fruity with notes of almond, apple, artichoke, and green banana. It is filtered through paper filters and bottled in dark glass. Its pungency is lower than that of Ayvalik, making it the perfect oil for sauteing, baking, or for mixing in salads with lemon.
This Arbequina cultivar Ultra-Premium Extra Virgin Olive Oil was harvested from the Zagoda Farm orchard by hand picking and pressed at a temperature below 80 °F within the same day of being harvested.
Arbequina (pronounced Are-Beh-Key-Nah) was originated in Catalonia, from the town of Arbeca, but pre-Catalonian texts state that it was introduced to the region from the Ottoman Empire. Many top producing olive farms adopt Arbequina olives because of their high adaptability and versatility, making it one of the most dominant and highly planted olive cultivars in the world!

FAQ
How to determine the quality of olive oil?
Olive oil's quality is determined by the acidity level; the lower acidity, the higher quality. Ultra-Premium (UP) is a new olive oil category that defines the best quality olive oil in the world. UP olive oil is much less acidic (less than 0.3%) then standard extra virgin olive oil (0.8%). Our oils have only 0.1% acidity, qualifying to be in the top tier of UP olive oils.
What are polyphenols?
Polyphenols are naturally occurring compounds found in plant foods. They act like an antioxidant; they neutralize any type of harmful agents that can damage a person’s cells. Extra virgin olive oil is one of the most valuable sources of polyphenols. Daily consumption of polyphenol-rich foods can help prevent certain long-term chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease.
How to store olive oil?
The most important factors for storing olive oil are: air (oxygen), light, odor, temperature and time. The oxygen in the air oxidizes olive oil, causing it to degrade faster. The beneficial minerals and polyphenols in olive oil are lost when olive oil degrades, affecting the taste. Olive oil should be stored in a tightly closed container, preferably in a colored glass bottle or ceramic container, where there is no moisture or direct sunlight. It should NOT be stored in a metal container!"

Polyphenols (mg/kg): 423.26mg
Acidity: 0.13%
Harvest date: 10/15/2021
Our Ayvalik oil has a fruity taste, coupled with a spicy bitterness and a pungent feel. Ayvalik oil gives a strong sensation of herbal notes that include: flowers, eucalyptus, fresh-cut grass, raw almonds, artichokes, and fig leaves. It is filtered through paper filters, and bottled in dark glass bottles to preserve its robust quality. These pungent notes make Ayvalik oil one of the top choices for salad dressings and marinades.
This Ayvalik cultivar Ultra-Premium Extra Virgin Olive Oil was harvested from the Zagoda Farm orchard by hand picking and pressed at a temperature below 80 °F within the same day of being harvested.
Ayvalik (pronounced Eye-Vah-Look) is the name of a seaside town located on the crystal blue waters of the Aegean Coast in Turkey. The cultivation of olive trees from this region has been the standard practice for over a millennia, dating back to the classical Greek periods, and cementing its status as one of the oldest cultivars of olives in the world. Apart from being famous for olive oil cultivation, it’s also famous for intricate cuisines that include fish, Turkish mezes, and even olive oil ice cream!

Our Arbequina is one of the lighter oils we offer. Its content is very buttery and fruity with notes of almond, apple, artichoke, and green banana. Its pungency is lower than that of Ayvalik, making it the perfect oil for sauteing, baking, or for mixing in salads with lemon.
Our Ayvalik oil has a fruity taste, coupled with a spicy bitterness and a pungent feel. Ayvalik oil gives a strong sensation of herbal notes that include flowers, eucalyptus, fresh-cut grass, raw almonds, artichokes, and fig leaves. These pungent notes make Ayvalik oil one of the top choices for salad dressings and marinades!
The Trilye we offer is a very robust and pungent oil. Common notes include fresh leaves, walnuts, cinnamon, pepper, and artichokes. The best use for Trilye is similar to Ayvalik: drizzled on salads and used in ingredients for homemade dressings, marinades, and dipping sauces.
These cultivars of Ultra-Premium Extra Virgin Olive Oil were harvested from the Zagoda Farm orchard by hand picking and pressing them at a temperature below 80 °F within the same day of being harvested. They are filtered through paper filters and bottled in dark glasses.

FAQ
How to determine the quality of olive oil?
Olive oil's quality is determined by the acidity level; the lower acidity, the higher quality. Ultra-Premium (UP) is a new olive oil category that defines the best quality olive oil in the world. UP olive oil is much less acidic (less than 0.3%) then standard extra virgin olive oil (0.8%). Our oils have only 0.1% acidity, qualifying to be in the top tier of UP olive oils.
What are polyphenols?
Polyphenols are naturally occurring compounds found in plant foods. They act like an antioxidant; they neutralize any type of harmful agents that can damage a person’s cells. Extra virgin olive oil is one of the most valuable sources of polyphenols. Daily consumption of polyphenol-rich foods can help prevent certain long-term chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease.
How to store olive oil?
The most important factors for storing olive oil are: air (oxygen), light, odor, temperature and time. The oxygen in the air oxidizes olive oil, causing it to degrade faster. The beneficial minerals and polyphenols in olive oil are lost when olive oil degrades, affecting the taste. Olive oil should be stored in a tightly closed container, preferably in a colored glass bottle or ceramic container, where there is no moisture or direct sunlight. It should NOT be stored in a metal container!"
