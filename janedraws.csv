If you are a homeowner or business owner in Philadelphia looking to begin a new construction project, you may be wondering how to get a permit in PA. The PA permit application process can be long and difficult to navigate if you do not know how to pull permits. If you are getting a small project done, an EZ permit (ezpermit) may be just what you need. An EZ Building Permit is a type of permit issued by the City of Philadelphia which allows a particular construction project to be completed without submitting plans or obtaining a full renovation permit. In theory it should be an ""easy permit"" to obtain to address ""ez properties"". EZ permits make building in Philadelphia a snap, while still maintaining PA building permits rules and guidelines.
Eligibility Requirements for an EZ Permit:
Single family home
No structural work needed or planned
Cost of work not to exceed $25k
Work to be completed by the home owner living on site OR
Work to be completed by a licensed contractor
In order to obtain an EZ Building Permit in Philadelphia, you must first submit a permit application to the city of Philadelphia License and Inspection. Your application must include detailed information about the proposed construction project, including the type of project, its location, and the estimated cost. Once you have submitted your permit application, L&I will review it to determine whether or not it meets all of the requirements for an EZ Building Permit. Philly standards allow either homeowners of a one to two story single home (home ownership must be denoted by both owning and living in the property full time according to license records), or a Philadelphia licensed contractor to complete the work.
How to Obtain An EZ Permit:
Along with your application you will be required to submit a sealed engineer letter stating that the property is in good condition and that no structural work is needed or planned. This stamped letter is your golden ticket and we provide them here at Jane Draws Plans. The process to obtain this letter from us is simple: book an appointment, we visit the site to inspect and take photos, we send an invoice, once the invoice is paid you will have the letter within 48 hours.
Follow Up Steps:
Once your application is approved, you will be required to pay a permit fee. The amount of the fee will depend on the type of construction project you are undertaking. After you have paid the fee, the City of Philadelphia will issue your EZ Building Permit. As with all Phila building permits, once you have been issued an EZ Building Permit, you must schedule an inspection using the contact information on your permit.
Once inspection is complete, you can begin work on your construction project. However, you must still adhere to all of the rules and regulations set forth in your EZ Building Permit, or your permit will be revoked. Finally, once your project is complete, you will be issued a Certificate of Approval from the city of Philadelphia which grants a certificate of occupancy.
Building Without Permits:
If your EZ Permit gets denied, that means that you need a phila building permit. You do not want to get hit with a building without a permit penalty. They are very costly, will not be covered under your homeowner's insurance, and you will most likely have to tear down all the work that you have done. If you do not know how to obtain a building permit, visit the city of Philadelphia building permits and they can provide you with a Philadelphia building permit checklist to get you started. Residential building permits will cost less than business building permits.
In Summary:
Obtaining an EZ Building Permit in Philadelphia is a relatively simple process if you are familiar with the requirements and regulations set forth by the City. By following the necessary steps, you can ensure that your construction project is completed in a timely and safe manner, and that you are in compliance with all applicable laws.

If you live in Philadelphia, and have received a property violation of ""unsafe"" or ""dangerous"" you may be wondering what to do next, or how to address this issue of unsafe construction. We are here to walk you through how to obtain a make safe permit, how to obtain a building permit, and following proper procedure.
Defining a Make Safe Violation:
A property violation of unsafe or dangerous comes from the city when they deem a property in such disrepair that it needs immediate attention. You would then obtain a Make Safe permit, which is a permit that can only be used to remedy a dangerous condition. This permit does not authorize any unnecessary additions or renovations. Both homeowners and authorized agents such as contractors, design professionals, and expeditors are able to apply for this permit.
Addressing the open violation:
If you do receive a violation, do not ignore it, as the penalties can be very costly. Failure to address an outstanding violation can result in massive fines, or even the demolition of your building or structure by the city. Go to Philadelphia Atlas and search your property address to find Philadelphia building permit records. Scroll down to "" Licenses and Inspections "" and then check for listed violations. You can click into these violations to get a better idea of the specifics. All of these violations need to be cleared before you can obtain any Phila building permits. The city does allow ample time after receiving a permit violation to rectify it, so take your time in selecting the proper contractors for the job, and obtaining the correct PA building permits, as you do not want to get hit with any other violations.
Obtain a Make Safe Permit:
Obtaining a Make Safe Permit after receiving a violation is a pretty straight forward process. Include the scope of work, as well as the homeowner information. You will also need to provide plans, pictures that depict the building's current conditions, and a report describing conditions and remediation. The plans need to be provided by a PA-Licensed Engineer. The plans will need to be signed and sealed by a professional engineer. You will also be required to pay a filing fee, which can vary depending on the size of the building. Once the project is complete, and once all the paperwork has been submitted, L&I will inspect the property to ensure the work has been completed correctly. Once the inspection is complete, L&I will issue the Make Safe Permit, which will satisfy the open violations.
Why Do You Need a Building Permit:
The penalty for building without a permit comes at a very high price. The contractors may not do a professional job, it could decrease the value of your home should you put it up for sale, and your home insurance may not cover any repairs that are needed. Worst of all, the city will put a stop work order, and you have to tear down all the work, and pay a huge fine. Not getting a regular building permit is one of the most common ways to get a violation on your property.
How Long Does it Take to Get a Building Permit:
Make Safe Permits follow a quick turn around time. It is important to stay on top of paperwork because revisions are required to be submitted on short notice. For a one to two family dwelling regular building permit, it typically takes 15 days to process the permit once you submit your building permit application, and 20 days for bigger structures. Building permits in Philadelphia are issued by the Department of Licenses and Inspections. Permits are required for any renovations that affect the properties structure. One thing I get asked a lot is how much is a building permit for a house? The application fee is $25 for a single or two family dwelling, and $100 for any other structure. The actual permit fee varies depending on which work you would like to get done. You can see a full list of fees here.
