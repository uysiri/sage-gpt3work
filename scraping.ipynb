With a little knowledge, you’ll be ready to move forward with getting the floors of your dreams! For tips and tricks about how to clean and care for your hardwood floors, to articles about the latest trends and styles in hardwood floors – you’ll find it all on the Hudson Hardwood blog.\\nConsidering Buying Hardwood Floors?\\nWith the many options available today it’s smart to do some homework first before you purchase hardwood floors. There are many varieties and styles available, the basics being solid or engineered planks. Solid planks come from a single piece of wood while engineered are comprised of several planks laminated or glued together.\\nLong strip, Exotic, Hand Scraped, and Distressed are terms used to describe the plank origin and the finish on the planks. Planks can come finished or unfinished. Unfinished planks allow them to be finished once they are installed, giving a more customized look.\\nDepending on the type of floor they are going over, hardwood floors can be installed in several ways. The most common is by nails or staples. Other options include glue, adhesive-less, and floating.\\nHardwood Floors Throughout the Home\\nCare and Cleaning of Hardwood Floors\\nSome people are hesitant to purchase hardwood floors because they’re afraid of the time and effort it will take to maintain them. Rest assured, hardwood floors are extremely durable. While scratches and stains can happen, there are ways to take care of them to keep your floors looking great for years.\\nHudson Hardwood recommends no harsh chemicals or cleaners. Over time these can build up and make your floors look bad. Occasionally, vinegar can help clean hardwood floors, but only in moderation.\\nScratches can also occur from moving furniture or other of life’s unforeseen happenings. Not to worry though, with a few short steps you can repair a scratch on your own. Visit our blog to see detailed instructions on “Hardwood Floor Scratch Repair.”\\nIt is, of course, a good idea to have your hardwood floors professionally cleaned and re-coated when they do eventually start to show signs of wear and tear. Hudson Hardware can help with this. Learn more on our Cleaning and Recoating page.\\nNational Wood Flooring Association Membership\\nHardwood Floors Today\\nMany of the areas we service date back to the 1800 and 1900s when hardwood floors were common in larger estates. Flooring has changed a lot since then, but hardwood floors remain top-of-the-line in home decor. Today’s technology and products gives us more hardwood flooring options than ever before to achieve the looks our customers want.\\nTraditional hardwood floors are made up of one plank size and then a consistent stain throughout. Today, consumers can choose from gray or bleached hardwood floors. Styles and patterns are even seeing a comeback including herringbone. Some customers are modernizing the look of their floors by laying planks at an angle rather than horizontally.\\nA few adventurous homeowners are even experimenting with the latest trend of mixing plank sizes. This unexpected style can add interest and depth to any room.\"}, {'url': 'https://hudsonhardwood.com/about-us/', 'article': 'Hudson Hardwood Floors specializes in refinishing, installing, cleaning, re-coating, and restoring hardwood floors & stairs.
