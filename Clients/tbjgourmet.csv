Bacon is a journey not a destination and our journey to and from the 2013 Petit Jean Bacon Bowl in hip and happening Fayetteville, Arkansas was littered with… excitement? Eric and I decided to load our luggage to the breaking point with The Bacons Jams: Bacon Spread made with Petit Jean Premium Bacon and embarked at exactly the right time to get to the Philly airport 10 minutes before our flight. At this point Eric thinks its my fault that we were late and I chalk it up as a mutual thing.
We go home, rest and get back to the airport in time for a later flight. While in Charlotte for a layover (there were no pedicures with pink pig face toe nails), we found out that our original flight was grounded due to engine trouble with celebrity bacon lover and fellow guest of Petit Jean, Adam Poch, on it. After arriving late in Fayetteville we found out that Adam was put on a bus out of Memphis and not due to arrive until 5am the next morning. This 24 hour long journey for NY to Fayetteville was presumably worse than anything the Big Brother producers had thrown at him.
At this point I took full credit for making us late to that defunct flight. Upon settling into our hotel room, Eric set up the snack table. I know what you are thinking, the big kid who cooks for a living should have been the one to think of a snack table... not the skinny guy who eats tic tacs all day. Well, as I found out over the trip, Eric is a far more experienced traveler than I. The snack table had everything to sustain us over the weekend: fruit, granola bars, chips, vitamins, and yes Bacon Jams! We cruised Dickson Street, a mix of South Street and Old City, to get the lay of the land. I have to say Fayetteville seemed pretty cool and the folk were beyond friendly.
The next day we found out how cool it was. The volunteers from Youth Bridge Foundation and a local frat had the whole space set up and ready to JAM! We barely lifted a finger until it was time to give out the samples of The Bacon Jams. When that happened we learned two things. First, NWA (North West Arkansas not the rap group) love The Bacon Jams. Second, the folks from Fayetteville all know an exec from Walmart! We sampled all the local bacon fare including a pork belly sandwich on bacon weaved bread (that is weaved bacon cooked until crispy and used to substitute bread.) Afterword, a night on Dickson Street! Apparently, it was Halloween but we were sans costumes so I slipped into my old faithful, Tall Tony Stark. All in all, a great trip with fun people."

We have had the pleasure of getting to know a lot of really great people on Instagram who create very delicious looking (and tasting) meals, snacks and other treats. Dara (aka Skinny Pig NYC) is by far one of our favorite people to watch create dishes using our bacon jam. Here is a quick interview with Dara and some things she has done with our products!
What is your favorite part about using The Bacon Jams?
I could literally eat it with a spoon and sometimes do.
First reaction to tasting The Bacon Jams?
Loved the packaging, loved the taste of the Red Chile & Garlic. That one is my favorite.
Thoughts on future use for The Bacon Jams?
I want to try and use it on pizza. It's a very strong flavor so I've been using it in small quantities but I want to try and make a bacon jam pesto of sorts for a pizza...
How do you like to use The Bacon Jams?
I use it on toast, on grilled cheese, on burgers, I even mix it in with sriracha/hummus to make a whole new bacon jam dip. It's perfect.

We finally got caught up from the melee that was the Love Park Christmas Village, so now it is back to business. We promised our Kickstarter backers a series of featured flavors and now we are delivering on that promise, because we keep promises, because we are good people… most of us… some off us…. maybe one of us was good at one point.
The Bacon Jams Feature Flavor Chocolate Cherry Bacon Jam is a delectable treat. We started, as always, with the main ingredient, high quality bacon. After getting the bacon jam base to the right point, we started to play! Delicious fresh cherries went in next in order to infuse the entire batch with their unique flavor. Next we added premium dark chocolate, then we added some more, and then a little more. The batch became a molten cauldron of bubbling goodness. The test-tasters nodded and smiled. A sense of pride came over the crew, as we jammed it into the jars. It looks fantastic!
What was created is a perfect combination of salty bacon, semi sweet chocolate, and naturally delicious cherries.
Recommendations for this feature flavor include breakfast spread for whole grain toast, a decadent thick brioche french toast finisher, dipping your favorite cookies in it for dessert, and making the best banana split ever. Enjoy!"

I have decided that The Bacon Jams should buy a RV and tour the country making and serving bacon jams. Now, I know this was Bruce’s original goal back in the beginning, and I am willing to admit he was right. After getting into all the amazing RV’s at the show, I was blown away. Most of them were bigger than my apartment and they were all nicer. Obviously, we will need a big kitchen and sleeping quarters for the whole team. The vehicle will have to be painted The only question is, who is going to drive?"

Have you ever looked at a slab of bacon and wondered at the awesome layering of fat, meat, fat, meat? I recently took note of how much a cross section of bacon looks like a layered cake… a delicious salty layered meat cake. While bemusing my observations among some fellow enthusiasts, I was informed that the Korean word for pork belly is 삼겹살 or Samgyeopsal, which literally means three layer flesh. It just proves what they say, you learn something new about bacon every day. I was also informed that Koreans eat grilled Samgyeopsal once or twice a week on average for dinner. So obviously I am planning a vacation."

We recently went to an event in what's billed as the most unique venue anywhere. The Fuge was previously used by the US Navy for extreme G-Force training and testing. It houses the world's first and largest centrifuge. Every American Astronaut that landed on the moon trained in this machine built into the bedrock of Warminster, PA.
Now The Fuge is an awesome venue for weddings, charity events, and even home shows, like the one we were at last weekend. Slinging The Bacon Jams underneath a modern marvel in a building steeped in the history of one of man’s greatest achievements was pretty cool. Getting to go for a “ride” in the centrifuge was even cooler. Coming to the realization that bacon jam should go into space was priceless.
Think about it. The Bacon Jam is shelf stable; it is loaded with the proper ratios of protein, carbs, and fat for sustaining life; and it delicious. So, if anyone knows some folks who are headed to Mars in the near future, see if they want to take The Bacon Jams!
Also, if you are looking to host an event in the area, check out The Fuge. The staff is super friendly, the facility is cooler than cool (in a nerdy way), and if you ask nicely you may get to take a spin!"

March 10 2014·
What do you do when you cook the weeks worth of bacon to jam and need to upgrade your phone? Trip to the mall!
Mike M., my right hand in the kitchen, finally broke down and admitted to himself that it was time to get a smartphone, you know so he can download recipes and Instagram. We headed out in the Bacon Jams van and fought through the traffic in order to get the furthest parking spot from the entrance.
The mall was in full swing. There were lines of soon-to-be-diners outside of Uncle Julio’s, goth kids by the fountain, and a broken elevator that could have easily be converted into stairs were the management willing to remove the out of order blockade.
Despite the challenge of finding a way to the upper level, we made it to the T-Mobile store. The store was mobbed with people looking for the coolest new phones and accessories. Of course, that is not Mike M. He wanted a nice phone, but not too flashy as long as it can “download recipes.”
There were talks of data plans and rebates, but when Mike M. dropped the fact that we cook The Bacon Jams, the script flipped. Vanessa the sales rep helping us was all like, “Really! I just heard about The Bacon Jams on the radio today and I wanted to try it!” I whipped out a jar for her. Now don’t start mobbing us every time we are out in public, we rarely carry concealed bacon jam. Vanessa agreed that The Bacon Jams is the bomb and by this time the other customers were asking about it. Before we could answer the onslaught of inquiries from the other customers, one of the other sales people started describing The Bacon Jams. He engaged the curious customers so well that I thought about asking Eric to hire him for the sales team. Apparently he had heard about bacon jam from another T-Mobile customer who was at our booth in the Christmas Village!
Being assured that our level of fame was not high enough to warrant free iPhones, Mike M. got what he came for. He and I headed out of the store with one more phone and one less jar of jam than we entered with. We were quite giddy about having turned the buzz in the store from cellular coverage to spreadable bacon coverage. All that remained to make this trip a success was a quick sample of mall chicken.

Maple season is upon us, or at least it will be as soon as the snow gets off of us. We are commemorating this magical time of year by launching our next feature flavor, Maple Habanero Bacon Jam, truly the best bacon gift. As always, we start with premium bacon in the kettle. Here’s the twist... we poured real maple syrup into the mix. This was faster said than done. While the syrup slowly dripped in, we started roasting some habaneros… by “some” I mean way more than we needed. We added the habaneros a little at a time, always tasting adding, adding tasting until we were full and the spice was right. The result is a mapley-sweet bacon flavor accented with warm habanero and black pepper notes. This goes great on pancakes, burgers, and, my favorite, roasted carrots."

This event already had some of the best things going for it: beer, bourbon and BBQ, but then The Bacon Jams showed up just to round it out. When I pulled up to the historic Cow Palace at the Maryland State Fairgrounds I knew I was in for a treat due to the huge array of premium beer and bourbon producers already setting up. I was also excited to see some of our favorite vendors, such as Whisky Rocks and Hank Sauce.
The Bacon Jams booth was located in the sweetest spot directly between the Du Claw tent and the band stand. The show opened with a wave of thirsty beer heads eager to sample the best brews known to man. The news of bacon jams spread quickly through the crowd and we had a queue formed up for almost the whole event.The band was jamming the whole time, but it never drowned out the inevitable “oooohhhh!” that spread throughout the crowd, shaming every poor soul who dropped their precious tasting glass on the unforgiving floor.
This part of beer culture sits in sharp contrast to the refined style of wine tasting. The highlight of the event for me was when the event coordinator came over to the booth for two cases of bacon jam. Was he buying it for personal use? No, Bacon Jam eating contest! The winner won $100.07, a mug, a Bacon Jams Tee, and the joy of devouring two jars of bacon jam in under 3 minutes. I honestly don’t know how he did it.
We could not have done this one with out Jake and Bev helping with the booth, Bruce bringing extra product down from Philly after we sold out, or Hubby for keeping my glass full with delectable suds. Oh, I also got to eat lake trout for the first time which was a big item on my bucket list ever since falling in love with HBO’s hit and best TV show ever, The Wire.

So I took a weekend off from selling bacon jam and went to Miami with some friends. It was my first time there and it was amazing. Warm weather, great food, and a great mix of people. The first night we went to South Beach to see the legendary Josh Wink at a cool little place called Tree House. We were met there by my friend Conshy Steve’s friend South Beach Steve. Don’t worry, we are getting to the part about bacon!
According to South Beach Steve, no one goes out in South Beach until 2am and the bars don't close until 6am. The upside to this insane schedule is that breakfast can be got after partying, but still at the appropriate breakfast time. So, we stop at a bumping breakfast joint, whose name eludes me. The waiter comes to take our order, going to South Beach Steve last.
“5 orders of bacon please,” he says.
The waiter replies, “Thats like 15 pieces of bacon.”
South Beach Steve contemplates this and then asks, “Yeah, I can order more later if I want right?”
“Sure,” says the waiter with a wry grin.
“Oh, I forgot to tell you, Steve really likes bacon. You should tell him about bacon jam,” Conshy Steve interjected.
“Whats bacon jam?” the other Steve asked.
I told him. We are pretty close friends now."

This is going to take a while before it gets to bacon or bacon jam but hang in there!
The other day a girl asked me if I spoke any “fancy languages”. I pondered this question as I was not sure which languages are considered “fancy”. For some reason, my mind went back to my first day of Japanese 101 with Dr. T. The first thing he taught us to say was, ""Watashi wa Bakada."" Translation, ""I am an idiot."" Dr. T was funny... But it's the second thing he taught us that really stuck with me.
A passing grade in the class was achieved by knowing how to order a beer then navigate to a bathroom in a Japanese immersion scenario. I will never forget ""Watashi ni biru o atearu kudase"" and ""O toire doko deska,"" and I have always made it a point to learn those two phrases first when exploring a new language and culture.
So I tell the girl asking about ""fancy languages"" that I can order a beer and find a bathroom on over half the globe. If this impressed her, she did not let on. She asked, ""Given your business shouldn't you know how to ask for bacon in as many languages?"" I thought about this for moment then replied, ""No, but I should be able to say 'I have the bacon,' in as many languages.""
And so should anybody who is traveling abroad. Honestly how else are you going to get you out of a pickle with the Russian mob in Moscow, end a standoff in Mexico, or get out of being Shanghaied in Shanghai. Your corny tourist translator book won't help you nearly as much as exclaiming, ""I have bacon"" while producing a jar of The Bacon Jams.
So here we go

(Disclaimer: All quotes are from a recreation of an actual event in Mike’s imagination and not from the awesomely loyal customers. The ambiguous use of geographic locations is intended to make you think Manayunk is really far from Conshohocken. It’s not that far but its further than I have ridden a bike in 15 years.)
What was the best part about the Manayunk Street Food Festival? The awesome food truck treats like the delectable ceviche from Farm Truck Philly and the incredibly popular selections of decadent mac & cheeses from Mac Mart Food Truck? Sure they were all fantastic, but not my favorite part. Was it this new image of Manayunk being a very fun but family friendly destination as opposed to the old man you're drunk image? This was a pleasant revelation, but not my favorite part. Was it the various reactions to being recorded by our new our new GoPro Hero camera (people do funny things when they know they are being filmed?) That was cool, but not the best part... by far.
The best part of our day in Manayunk last weekend was when a couple showed up to re-up their bacon jam supplies. Manayunk is a well known destination for cyclists so when the 10th dude wearing spandex and a helmet walked up to buy some bacon jam I didn't bat an eyelash. When he and his wife said that they had ran out of their original order of bacon jam from our KickStarter.com campaign and rode their bikes to Manyunk from Montgomery County just to buy some more, I felt an overwhelming sense of pride. Sure it was a nice day for a ride and there was tons of fun stuff to do in Manayunk, but that doesn’t diminish the fact that their main goal was to re-up their supply.
Him - “Hey honey it says here that The Bacon Jams is going to be at a street fair in Philly.”
Her - “What are we waiting for mount up!”

I love industry food shows. They have been my favorite work-related diversion and over the past 10 years... I have been to many. The Philly Farm & Food Fest was the first one I attended as an exhibitor, but the experience was similar, save for its groovy go green twist. There were a bunch of people representing their locally focused brands and showing of their earth-conscious goods. The fun part was, as it always is, seeing new products and new uses for items that are already staples on my shopping list. The best part was obviously stuffing my face with delicious treats like Philly Bread’s Philadelphia Muffins, a giant Philly version of everyone’s favorite nook and cranny ridden toasted treat, and Obis One’s Organic Black Garlic, can you say feature flavor bacon jam, and OWowCow Creamery’s sensuous chocolate habanero organic ice cream.
I loved walking up to other vendor’s booths to peek at their selections and having them get stoked about my badge. “Oh, you’re the bacon jam guy? I was told I have to try it!” Hearing that phrase repeat over and over makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside… unless there is somebody running around these events maliciously forcing people to try our bacon jam. In that case I would feel horrible.
Back at our booth local small business owner attendees were getting excited about being able to use The Bacon Jams in their food products in the very near future. Look for bacon jam ice cream, donuts, and grilled cheese in the area from some of our favorite vendors. Don’t worry we will let you know where you can find these things, as soon as they are available.
All in all, REI’s Philly Farm and Food was a blast. We made some great new friends, exposed them to our jams, and got to try some tasty treats… also Eric and I scored some greenery from Peace Tree Farms. Is that a fig tree?

Back in January, Jeff ran into local celebrity, Mike Jerrick, at the Philly Home Show. Mike tried The Bacon Jams and loved them. We all thought this was great! When Eric told me last Thursday that I was scheduled to go on Mike's show, Good Day Philadelphia, a mixture of excitement and terror came over me. Eric and I spent the ride home from the MD Bacon Festival in Baltimore role playing and getting the nerves out. But NOTHING could have prepared me for how beautiful Kacie McDonnell was in-person!
While setting up our food presentation, I was starting to get nervous again. Then, Mike Jerrick had a 5 minute conversation with Dr. Oz about flatulence... How could I be nervous after that?!? He and Kacie came over to get set up. ""So how do you say your last name?"" Mike Jerrick asked me. ""or-uh-chef-ski,"" I said. ""Yeah, your just gonna be Mike today!"" He replied. And we were LIVE!
The rest was a 4 minute blur where two great personalities did their thing. After we went off-air, Sue Serio came running over to try some bacon jam before the other two could polish it off. ""You are my wife's favorite,"" Eric told Sue. She snaps back with, ""your wife is smart!""
The folks there at Fox29 were amazingly friendly and funny. I hope we get invited back!

Today I was in North Philly grabbing some ingredients for a jam session. I was riding along in the Jam Van with the window down enjoying the glorious sunny day when I heard the first honk. I check my mirrors, gathered that I was driving appropriately and carried on. Another honk. This time, I looked over my shoulder to make sure the tailgate was closed and that I wasn't spilling onions, brown sugar, and honey all over the streets of Philadelphia. (This happens to be a fear I have developed after years of overloading my car with food products in the service of my restaurant). Stopped at a light about to get on JFK Blvd... a guy pulled up next to me and honked. Ugh, had I ticked someone off 5 miles back and had he been chasing me all this time? I turned to look and saw the man was driving what would be called in the Philly vernacular, a Hoopty Jawn. “Sup?” I asked. “The Bacon Jams is the S@%T!” the dude exclaimed while pointing to The Bacon Jams door magnet on our own Hoopty of a utility vehicle. You see, ever since the company co-oped my car last year, every time it goes to an event we tag it with another The Bacon Jams logo sticker. You know like a fighter pilot puts on his jet when he shoots down a bogie, except that instead of a multimillion dollar weapons platform, we have a beat-up Toyota Matrix. Now, we have The Bacon Jams door magnets to lend a certain level of classiness that was previous lacking on our Hoopty.
Back to the North Philly dude following me around, honking just to tell me he loves The Bacon Jams. First, I was ecstatic! All chefs rave approval and getting it from people you don’t know who are under no obligation to give it to you is amazing. Next, I did one of the coolest, like Fonzie-cool, things I have done in a while. I nodded to my new friend while reaching for a jar of The Bacon Jams Red Chili and Garlic Spreadable Bacon. I tossed the jar to the dude as the light turned green and cruised down onto Route 1 without a word, thinking that I might have made that guys day, but not nearly as much as he made mine.

We are coming off yet another action packed weekend for The Bacon Jams as the outdoor festival season continues to take form. It is great watching everything take bloom from the trees, to the people pouring to the outdoors to embrace the weekend and the weather!
Saturday AM kicked off with Team Bacon Jam at the Skippack Spring Fest with the knowledge of a nice start to the day, but severe rainstorms in the afternoon. Well, Mother Nature met expectations. After a nice AM Jam Session mixing with the locals, it was time to hunker down and make sure the bacon jam was safe and secure to weather the impending storm. Simultaneously, at the Mount Hope BrewFest at the Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire, we provided much needed sanctuary for the drenched beer and bacon lovers, making it an intimate and fun day!

We get a message, as one of our friends and customers was going through PHL airport security, enroute to Las Vegas. He witnessed a woman going to bat to keep her jar of Red Chile & Garlic bacon jam as a carry on to snack with during her flight. After a lengthy confrontation, the TSA agent had the young lady toss her jar into the blue bin, and would not let her advance with it to her flight. If this was you (or if you know of this woman), please contact us as we applaud you for taking it upon yourself to have a proper inflight snack!
Keep on jamming!

""Its not about me jamming for the fans, but about how they can share their jam experiences with me,"" James says.
""Its not about me jamming for the fans, but about how they can share their jam experiences with me""
In between shows, James will be actually ditching the typical rock star tour bus and staying with his fans. Mr. Bacon cryptically stated, ""It's less about the tour and more about the touring,"" adding that ""Sure, I want to jam out all the time, but this tour is about connecting with cool people, inspiring locations, and amazing events."" When asked what which dates and locations for the shows on the tour, James stated, ""I can't call it.""
""Sure, I want to jam out all the time, but this tour is about connecting with cool people, inspiring locations, and amazing events.""
This corroborates the rumor that all his shows will be impromptu and unscheduled. James' regular film and photography crew will not be following him on this tour so he has asked you, his fans, send pictures, videos, and updates whenever you see him."

I was coming off a long company road trip when I met up with some friends at a very cool brew pub in Mt. Joy, Pa called Zuckfoltzfus. Like a lot of the newer places in Lancaster county, they have an awesome mixture of quaint and hip in their vibe, but with a menu that blow your socks off. On that menu they have a burger with bacon jam. Now, mind you at this point, in terms of work I'm off the clock, AFK, out or pocket, etc... You know, just trying to relax with my friends, but I gotta try it. Knowing how hard bacon jam is to make, I offer to pay for a small sample.
The bartender seemed reluctant to accommodate my request due to the fact that everyone asks to try it… Then they run out... then they don't have it for their awesome burger. At this point I go out to the car and grab a jar of The Bacon Jams All Original. I come back, set it down on the bar and ask to trade one if my jars for some of theirs. The owner comes out shortly thereafter with a crock of their bacon jam and some tasty little homemade beer bread bites. I pop open my jar. It was a jam off!
My friends, thoroughly embarrassed about the fact that I don't shut up about bacon, and everyone at the small bar starts to dig in. Mmm's and ohh's replace the previous playful banter. Soon, wild proposals of marriage and murder were flying about. Was their savory concoction containing their own house brewed stout and local Lancaster bacon the best or was it my refined spreadable bacon goodness? I can't call it. Everyone there was a winner because they got to try two great bacon jams. There was agreement all around that bacon jam is an amazing invention and should be enjoyed by everyone. The only doubt in the minds of some was whether or not I went to Zuckfoltzfus looking for a jam fight.
P.S. The Beer Milkshake will rock your face almost as much as the maple glazed pork belly. Thank you for the recommendations, Sassy Pants.

We talked a little bit about the Bacon Jam Van in a previous post, Hoopty Jawn, but I feel my old whip has been getting enough attention that we can talk about it some more. This reliable Toyota Matrix actually looks like a pig, with its rounded edges and plump back side. I remember my buddy commenting on how, looking at it head on, the model looked like a pig. I never would have imagined how prophetic that statement was 10 years ago.
As we know, the car is covered in The Bacon Jams stickers representing all the shows it's been to and some other key moments. A big pink logo magnet with James Bacon jamming on his guitar also sticks on the door.
Oh, I said the bacon jam can was getting attention right? Yeah. We are slingin’ bacon jam as usual at Flavor Fest on the beautiful Mt Hope Winery grounds in Manheim, PA when a group of four fine folks practically ran up to us. ""Bacon bacon BACON!!!,"" the member who seemed to be the most proficient wine taster exclaimed. ""We were wondering what The Bacon Jams was since Thursday night,"" he said.""Oh, did you see us on the Flavor Fest site?"" ""No,"" he said while sampling the original. ""Well, did you hear about us on the news or something?"" ""No,"" he said while licking his spoon. ""So, why have you been wondering about us since Thursday?""
""We saw your sticker-covered car in front of the Selinsgrove Brew Pub Thursday night and were wondering what The Bacon Jams was all about since."" Why I didn't ask them why they didn't google it or go to the website eludes me, but in any case I should clarify two things. First, Selinsgrove is almost 2 hours from the Winery and I was only there one night... What a coincidence. Second, the Selinsgrove brewery has a delectably delicious cream ale.
The moral of this story is that if parking the Bacon Jam Van in front of a brewery gets us at least one new customer, I think it is reasonable to do it every day!

It was a straight shot down I-95 on a Friday afternoon mid-June... What could go right? DC traffic, check! Summer downpour bringing cars to a halt, check! The Jam Van so packed with sweet, spreadable bacon that two 6'+ dudes have just enough leg room for Tyrion Lannister, check! Heat, check! Anything else? Oh, we are talking about I-95, so... construction, check!!!
We were prepared. Plenty of snacks, hydration, good tunes, and the knowledge that bringing the bacon jam truth to the good folk of Richmond, VA, kept me and my co-pilot, Skittles, in the right state of mind.
Somewhere south of DC, we were driving at a steady 30 mph in some of the aforementioned construction traffic. A car pulls up on our passenger side with two young ladies within. ""Can we get a Bacon Jam T-Shirt?"" They ask in shrill synchrony. I should mention that there is a mannequin with a hot pink bacon jams tee in our back window. Skittles yells back over the humming of hundreds of idling cars combined with giant idling construction machines, ""What size?"" ""Medium,"" the girl in the passenger seat yells across. As Skittles dives into the back of the car to snag a tee, I yell over, ""$15 ladies."" The driver trying to haggle, as the passenger starts to rummage through her purse, ""What!? You’re gonna charge us?"" ""Yup $15,"" I snap. ""It's not like this happens to you everyday,"" the driver retorts.
I think back to all the times people have pulled up and started asking about The Bacon Jams. By this time, Skittles is back in his seat... pink tee in hand. ""Actually this kind of thing happens all the time.""
Traffic starts to clear up and our two cars are separated due to my desire to be a better driver than a salesman. ""That sucks,"" Skittles lamented. ""We're not losing that sale, bro,"" I respond. A few miles down the road, traffic gets congested again and we are back to a leisurely 10 mph.
This time the girls are coming up on our left. ""15 right?"" The girl in the passenger seat asked, as they got close. I gave her the thumbs up. Traffic stopped, but they were half car length behind us. Home girl opens the car door as traffic starts to move again, ""No no no stay in the car, are you crazy. You can't run around on 95,"" I yell as images of the horrible headlines involving bacon jam, traffic jam, and girl jammed by a Mac truck.
After keeping it close a little longer, we finally got to a standstill in traffic where we were directly across from each other. ""My boyfriend is going to be so excited, he loves the bacon jams!"" the girl in the passenger seat exclaimed as she leaned out of the car with some cash. My intrepid copilot tossed the bundled tee out of our window and into theirs as she handed me the cash.
Best transaction of the weekend!

It was another straight shot up 95. We shared the road with people who seemed to know where they were going, but didn't know why they were going there. Our destination, a playground for the American dreamers, Mohegan Sun. This glacial palace, filled with replicas of Mohegan culture, sits on a bluff above the majestic Thames River in southeastern Connecticut. ""We're here on assignment,"" I said to the valet as the car jumped up onto the curb, ""keep her close."" My attorney, who had already arrived, was waist deep in handling the check in. ""What's the score here?"" I asked. ""This is no time for interruptions, I advise you to order cocktail and sit by the waterfall until this is sorted,"" he replied. Sound advice, and who was I to argue with sound advice.
Room key and drinks in-hand, we headed to the elevators, one step closer to the safety and comfort of our room. ""Are you here for the BBQ festival?"" Ask a perky young lady once the elevator doors slide shut. How did she know? Was it our bacon jam tee shirts? Or the crazed look of men driven to the edge of bacon mania in our eyes. ""You see we are doing a piece for a... TV show on the BBQ fest... What do you cook?"" She drilled deeper into him. ""Who me? I cook bacon jam, big pieces of bacon,"" he says holding his hands out wide. ""We're with the Bacon Jams Black Shadow Team,"" I explain as we escape from the overcrowded elevator.
In the room we assess our supplies and determine a second refrigerator is necessary to accommodate our snack table. It's not that we needed all of it, but once you get locked into a serious snack collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.
We headed to the pool side to bask in the remaining sunlight that the day had to offer and to fortify ourselves with the sustenance . One burger with extra bacon jam, grilled vegetable plate, two whole grapefruits, and three cups of ice. The waitress was confused but obliged. The rest of the night was a blur of explaining bacon jam and playing poker.
The next morning, a bright Mohegan sun ripped through the shades like a hungry wolf. Did I miss the event? I guzzled a pot of coffee while trekking through the casino floor enroute to the BBQ district. Upon exiting the building, a vast parking lot with columns of smoke rising from a multitude of BBQ pits lay before me. This was it. Some of this country’s best competing for smoked meat glory. The coffee had kicked me into high gear by the time I got the bacon jams tent. ""You drank coffee?"" My attorney asked scornfully, knowing that it is not something I normally do. ""I did, to no fault of my own,"" I replied. He saw the twitching in my eyes, ""too much, you drank too much."" No matter, we had a mission. We had to sling the bacon jam to the good people of Connecticut. They came like a beautiful bacon-crazed wave and I think now, 5 days later, you can climb up a steep hill outside of Mohegan and with the right eyes you can see where that wave broke and rolled back.

No, no, not the tree hugging, hippy kind of green, although we do try our best to do our part in that regard as well... I mean the kilt wearing, bagpiping, tabor tossing kind of green. The Celtic Fling was another spectacular event at what is quickly becoming my favorite venue for The Bacon Jams, the PA Renaissance Faire. Dudes in kilts and women in corsets came in droves to see the best in celtic music from the heavy warlike drum beats and haunting bag piping of Albannach to the distinctly American bluegrass, celtic, punk fusion of Cut Throat Shamrock. Their ale was flowing, there were people dancing, and of course there were turkey legs... giant smoked turkey legs.
This was the first time we were at Faire (that's what the residents call it) while there were more people dressed in traditional, period, or otherwise non-vanilla apparel, than not. There is something cool about giving a sample of bacon jam to a man who looks like he marched with William Wallace with his 5 foot long sword, seeing him turn to his kilted buddies, and hearing him say, ""dudes, you gotta try this!"" We had wenches declaring their love of the sales team and knights kneeling in fealty to Sir James, Lord of Bacon.
Was the event awesome? Yes! Did we get tired of the nonstop barrage of celtic jams blasting into our tent? Never! Did I finish all my Haggis? Noooo, but I did have a horn of ale or two, thanks to my accomplice... Thanks BH!
The Bacon Jams loves the PA Renaissance Faire, all it's staff, and the regulars who make it such a fun place. We shall see you anon.

It was Saturday, May 3 – a sunny, magnificently pleasant day in Philadelphia. I arrived at the South Street Headhouse Spring Festival to help out and work the stand for Philly Phaithful, a creative Philadelphia sports apparel company. Lo and behold, The Bacon Jams happened to be our neighbor. This wasn’t a coincidence, it was fate.
I watched with piqued curiosity – I also may have been drooling – as swarms of people surrounded The Bacon Jams table, everyone gleefully accepting a mini-spoonful of either All Original, Black Pepper or Red Chile & Garlic. Very rarely did anyone stop at one flavor, though, often electing to sample all three. Hours passed; morning turned into afternoon, afternoon into early evening. Other stands had lull periods without much in the way of patronage or even perusers. That was not the case for The Bacon Jams. There was always a line at least five deep, with passerby and stragglers inquisitively looking on, wondering what all the buzz was about. I could always tell the instant someone’s taste buds entered into a state of euphoria and fired off a synapse to his or her brain that The Bacon Jams was the real deal. Eyes widened, smiles formed and the taster would turn to someone else and point to the eight-ounce jar, as if to say, “You have to try this.”
I decided mid-afternoon that I couldn’t resist any longer. I had introduced myself to Eric and his sales associate, Anna, earlier in the day, but I had not yet asked to try the product. When I inquired about the best flavor, Eric didn’t hesitate – Red Chile & Garlic. Yes, I’ll take one of those, please. Amidst the chaos of people clamoring to try The Bacon Jams, Eric gave me his business card and I gave him that of my boss. He was looking for a printer to produce some bacon jam shirts, I was looking for another startup I believed in and wanted to be part of as it took off. I let Eric know of my interest to spread the gospel of The Bacon Jams and help in any way possible.
“Send me an e-mail,” he said. “Stick with me, we’re going to go far.”
I went home that night with a jar of Red Chile & Garlic, as well as a complementary All Original and Black Pepper that had been opened as samples but not finished. My housewarming party was that night, and all three flavors were used as dip for chips. The reaction was unanimous, resounding approval, with multiple people asking, “Where can I buy this?” The next day, I had my heart set on making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. As I reached into the refrigerator for the raspberry jam, I saw the jar of All Original staring me right in the face. Oh, yeah, I thought, it’s time to get funky. You better believe I slathered some All Original on my PB&J to make it a PBJ&TBJ sandwich. Would you doubt me if I said it was delicious? I’m not exaggerating when I say that bacon jam goes on literally anything.
I sent Eric an email soon thereafter. He got back to me a few days later, and we set up a phone call for the following week. When we spoke, he outlined his vision for The Bacon Jams and where he felt I fit. Eric’s enthusiasm and energy are infectious. He believes in the product and the team and he knows he has something special going. I really didn’t need any further convincing, honestly, he had me at “spreadable bacon.”
The revolution is here, and the condiment world will never be the same. I can’t wait to do my part to make sure The Bacon Jams takes over.

Gadzooks! We recently got an invite to go on the Preston & Steve Show on 93.3 WMMR Philadelphia to feed the gang and their guests some bacon jam infused delights. The morning started early at the Conshohocken Cafe with Clarissa ""Girl Face"" Gavin and I whipping up some treats. Eric loaded up the car and we took the back roads to the station.
We arrived at 1 Bala Plaza around 7:30 and set the spread out in the Green Room which was filled with show guests and some lovely interns. Soon after, we sat down in the studio and were greeted by the gang. I have to be honest, the guys seemed a little trepidatious with the thought of trying the bacon jam at the beginning of one commercial break. Casey Boy, being the brave soul that he is, went first, grabbing a grilled cheese with bacon jam. ""You guys really have to try this!"" Nick dove into the turkey avocado bacon jam sandwich. ""Wow this is good.""
During the next commercial break, the rest of gang, taking Casey's advice went in for the goods. ""Wow, it's actually really good,"" Preston said off air to Steve. Soon, all the food was gobbled up and there were BIG smiles all around. It was cool that I was able to bring smiles to the faces of the folks that have brought a smile to my face oh so many times. The only thing that was confusing was just why Kathy couldn't stop thinking about clams!

Casey Boy, being the brave soul that he is, went first, grabbing a grilled cheese with bacon jam. ""You guys really have to try this!"" Nick dove into the turkey avocado bacon jam sandwich. ""Wow this is good.""
During the next commercial break, the rest of gang, taking Casey's advice went in for the goods. ""Wow, it's actually really good,"" Preston said off air to Steve. Soon, all the food was gobbled up and there were BIG smiles all around. It was cool that I was able to bring smiles to the faces of the folks that have brought a smile to my face oh so many times. The only thing that was confusing was just why Kathy couldn't stop thinking about clams!"
https://tbjgourmet.com/blogs/news/14917277-the-long-day,"The Long Day
So I talked last time about going on the Preston & Steve show, but that experience was just one part of a very long day.
As I mentioned it started early, 5am early, with Clarissa and I banging out some bacon jam laden grub at the Conshohocken Cafe. I also mentioned Eric and I hit the WMMR studio hard, spreading the spread out on the green room in an effort to spread the word of The Bacon Jams across the airwaves.
What I didn't mention is that we got to have our faces melted with the hard rock jams of the band Royal Blood. This in-studio performance was their US debut and they crushed it! The boys invited us to their show later that night at the Underground Arts. Duh, yes, I want to do that!
But work before play. Eric and I said our goodbyes and headed to the warehouse to grab supplies for our second gig of the day... setting up at the Greater Philadelphia Gift Show. The upside to this gig was that we were veterans compared to the last time around. In and out, like the wind.
We had enough time for a late lunch hosted by our star sales person and expert groundskeeper, Angela. Grilled wings... Yes please.
I got home with enough time to hit the roof-deck for some rays of setting sun before heading to meet up with Matt ""the man"" Rovine from WMMR. Matt was cool enough to drop off some extra tickets for the show later that night... Now we could roll deep to this sold out shindig. Thanks brother!
Now it's rush hour, but the Jam Van cuts through traffic on the Schuylkill like a knife through... Bacon jam. I swing into South Philly to pick up Andy Fantastic before looping back up to meet the rest of the folks going to the show. Did I run a red light? Maybe, but if I did, it was at 5mph while driving away from a guy to whom we were giving directions... Still not sure about any of that drive.
We got to the venue and parked. Immediately after getting out of the jam van, two dudes approached us. They were obviously going to the show due to there black on black apparel and ability to slug brews while banging heads. ""No fair you already got a show this morning."" One of them said. ""Huh?"" Andy Fantastic replied. ""Bacon Jams,"" the guy said pointing to our ride, ""you are the guys with the spreadable bacon!"" ""Damn right we are! You guys heard the show this morning?"" I asked. He went on to say that they listened all the time and were wondering all day about the bacon jams. We explained as we went into the venue.
Underground Arts looks and feels exactly as you would think when hearing its name... It's a dark underground basement that hosts the arts. The show started with the hard garage licks of the Baltimore-based Bad Seeds who, despite their young appearance, carried some weight. Royal Blood came on and the boys rocked the sold out crowd. Relentless drumming and a masterful display of base melody persisted throughout all their songs as the crowd banged along. Almost everyone in the crowd knew every song from this band that hasn't even dropped their first album! Right before they belted out the first beat of their soon to be hit ""out of the black"" I got a viscous fist bump from our friend from outside. ""Bacon jam man, this show rocks!"" The band kicked it into high gear and I nearly lost my glasses as my head started to whip my imaginary locks in a circle. The show ended with high-fives all around. We rolled out to the Broad Street Diner for a debrief on the concert. That's when I realized that I hadn't had a disco nap or a drop of caffeine during this long rollercoaster of a day... Sometimes you just have to jam through.

When you have a pig playing a guitar on the side of your car and pull up to the gates of Musikfest in Bethlehem, it's not surprising to be asked by security, ""what stage are you playing on?"" Security is, however, surprised when you respond, ""the pink one,"" while handing them a jar of bacon spread.
That's how we started the 10 days of food, jams, and jamming at the Bethlehem Festplatz. Nonstop music and a steady stream of folks ready to rock flooded the Lehigh Valley. There was classic rock, country, folk, polka and more. Bacon Jam photographer and friend, Thelma Van, and I were front row for the gooooorgeous Sheryl Crow. Bruce and Shirley grooved to the sweet sounds of Steely Dan. Skittles got to see Weezer for the first time. Anna and Dan were hit with the ""rokenrol"" onslaught of one of my favorite bands The Red Elvises, whose song ""Bacon"" was certainly a crowd pleaser. Thanks for the shout out, Igor!!!
Oh, there was food, too! Most of it on sticks and/or fried. Meat on sticks, pickles on sticks, fried potatoes on sticks, deep fried cheese cake on sticks! Of course, we put bacon jam on all these items as people walk by!
All in all, the event was a blast. We got to see a lot of out friends from the area and beyond! Notably, original bacon jam kickstarter supporter, Mega Hurtz and some of the Lehigh Valley Roller Girls stopped by the booth. Also, Alex ""Tron"" Avelino, of Conshy Cafe fame, was drawn to the pink tent for a surprise jam session. Thanks to everyone who made it go down without a frown. See y'all for Ocktoberfest!

Sometimes you get stuck between a rock and a hard place other times you get stuck between two roses.
Eric and I went to Chicago for the Windy City Gift Show a few weeks ago. Big Bad Ed, a truly large man in both stature and personality, drove us down to the airport in the jam van. I told someone that morning that if I was ever a pro golfer Ed would be my caddy. When I was asked to explain I said, ""Cause Ed knows more about golf than i do and he's been shot... That's the kind of experience I want in my corner. ""
We get to the Philadelphia Airport, check in, clear the TSA, and arrive at our terminal without incident. Eric and I board right after First Class. As we make our way down the aisle in the main cabin, I see the only two passengers seated in the coach section.
They are two almost identical ladies, one sitting in the aisle seat, the other the window of the same row. Imagine Mike Myers as the Coffee Talk Lady but older... much older. Now imagine that he is playing a near identical character, as he is prone to do, and that there is a seat in between them. Keep in mind that every other seat in the plane is empty. Eric turns to me, "" I guarantee that's my seat."" ""It has to be,"" I agreed. As we got closer it became apparent that fate had indeed placed Eric between these two bubbies. ""Hello ladies,"" Eric said, ""I'll be sitting with you today.""
""The thorn between two roses,"" one of them said deadpan. ""He certainly is a thorn. Have fun with him ladies,"" I squeezed out between muffled laughter.
""Do you want to switch seats? At least you know the score here!"" Eric half pleaded. ""No thanks, I'll roll the dice and pray I get sandwiched between a hot chick and a bacon lover,"" I said over my shoulder as I got into my middle seat, waiting to see who my travel companions would be. ""Well ladies, let's get a few blankets and get cozy,"" Eric said wryly as he accepted his mission.
Now there had been some fine looking women in the terminal, so part of my bet was reasonable. And sitting next to a bacon lover is almost a given, but after a gorgeous Temple Med student took the window seat and a dude wearing an “I Love Pork Butt” t-shirt took the aisle seat in my row, I knew the travel gods were smiling on me.
The flight landed without a hitch with the exception of some turbulence right before arriving at O'hare, during which Eric's one neighbor started to apply her lipstick in an apparent attempt to mimic Heath Ledger as The Joker. We said our goodbyes to our travel companions and hit the Windy City.
Fast Forward... I am not exactly sure what happened in that row during that flight but Eric must have made an impact. Today an email came in from one of the Roses, “We met you on the plane going out to Chicago a couple of weeks ago - you had to sit in the middle of my sister and myself - remember ?? haha
I have told many people about your product and they have all thought it to be a terrific idea and are wondering how to order it to try - when you have a moment - could you possibly let me know this -
I hope your things are going great - and all is well with you. ~KG

https://tbjgourmet.com/blogs/news/15224433-kids-are-the-key,"Kids are the Key
If there’s one thing I’ve learned about sales from working various markets and festivals, it’s this: Always be sure to cater to the kids. They’re likely to wander off from their parents to explore on their own, staying within the confines of the market to remain safe but with enough distance to feel a hint of independence. When those inquisitive youth come upon The Bacon Jams stand, they often stop dead in their tracks and stare in wonder, tacitly begging me to extend an invitation.
“Hey there, you want to try some?” I say as I extend a wooden spoon with a sample of bacon jam on the tip.
Those interested in satiating their piqued curiosity will nod yes and walk over, others will shyly giggle and avert their eyes before hurriedly running off, then there are those who purse their lips and turn up their noses to let you know there’s no way they’re opening their mouths. I like the ones who nod yes and walk over, the adventurous leaders of tomorrow eager to let their taste buds explore.
Because, you see, once you get the kids hooked, they’re going to go get their parents and implore them to buy a jar of The Bacon Jams' bacon jam.
“Mom, this is so yummy, you gotta try it and get some!”
“Dad, can we pleeeeeeeeeease buy one?!”
There’s a certain intrinsic delight that results from expanding horizons and introducing people to something they’ve never before experienced. Winning over skeptical adults is essential, but watching kids enjoy bacon jam with a wide smile never gets old. For a second, it doesn’t feel like I’m conducting business. Of course, the pleasure doubles when a parent decides his/her child’s happiness is worth buying a jar of delicious bacon jam to take home.
Kids, they are the key.

https://tbjgourmet.com/blogs/news/15360197-bacon-jam-on-ice-cream,"Bacon Jam on Ice Cream!?!?!
I was recently visiting a friend in Ventnor City, New Jersey, and one night after dinner we went to Two Cents Plain, an ice cream spot in Margate, just down Ventnor Avenue. Now, Two Cents Plain is famous for its ice cream waffles -- a combination of Belgian waffles topped with the ice cream flavor of your choice. As I stood in line waiting to order a cone of Salted Hazelnut Crunch and Peanut Butter ice cream and watched one of the waitresses prepare an ice cream waffle, an idea popped into my head: Hey, you know what would be an awesome addition to the ice cream waffles here at Two Cents Plain? Bacon jam!
That’s when the my food fantasy started to form. I saw a stack of bananas on the counter in front of me and immediately knew what I wanted to do as my taste buds nearly leapt off my tongue and out of my mouth in excitement. How delicious would it be to put a scoop of your ice cream of choice (I’d recommend vanilla or some special vanilla-inspired variant flavor) on your Belgian waffle, then top it with a cut up a banana that has been slathered in All Original Bacon Jam? I'm actually salivating as I write this. I know coming up with creative recipes for our three flavors of bacon jam is usually Mike’s wheelhouse, but I couldn't resist sharing this with the world.
Whether it’s Two Cents Plain -- I'll be pitching the idea to the owner next time I return -- or a regular restaurant out there that offers a similar dish, I have to believe a waffle-ice cream sundae type of concoction with All Original Bacon Jam dollopped in would be an instant favorite among the clientele.
In fact, after returning home from Ventnor, I went out to the store to get some waffle mix, vanilla ice cream and a bushel of bananas. I whipped it up right there in my kitchen, Belgian waffles topped with vanilla ice cream, a sliced banana and All Original Bacon Jam. Trust me, it was even more delectable than I imagined, and I encourage you to make it on your own!

Before getting into the story that gives us the name of this post, it is important to share a big announcement. The Bacon Jams will be appearing on QVC on Monday, October 13th at 5pm Eastern. QVC is the largest multi-channel retailer in the country and they are always looking for new and exciting products to bring to their audience. When QVC tasted The Bacon Jams, they immediately wanted Mike to come into the studio and make a whole bunch of delicacies to share with their audience. So, please watch for us on QVC on October 13th!
The logistics to get a product into a large vendor like QVC are quite daunting, and it provides a substantial challenge for a small company like The Bacon Jams. The offering on QVC will consist of a 3 pack of Bacon Jam with our beautiful, new recipe booklet. So, not only did we have to design, layout and produce a recipe booklet, but we had to design special boxes, and put them all together. It may not seem obvious at first, but for us to do a variety 3 pack requires taking large amounts of each flavor and then building the 3 pack boxes, and putting one of each in with a booklet and then closing the package. It is a daunting task for a small company like ours to handle. This is where SUNCOM comes into play. I think their website says it best.
“SUNCOM Industries is a nonprofit, human services agency, which helps people with developmental and physical disabilities improve the quality of their lives.”
We heard about SUNCOM from some friends and contacted them about helping The Bacon Jams package thousands of units of product in preparation for our QVC debut. After shipping thousands of jars of The Bacon Jams, boxes, and recipe books to SUNCOM for assembly, I showed up on the appointed day to make sure all went as planned. I must say I was totally unsure of what to expect going into the day, but I felt ready for anything. After all, The Bacon Jams was building our largest order ever to deliver to a premier retail channel.
“SUNCOM workers deliver a quality job on time, and at a competitive price.” - SUNCOM website
SUNCOM is a very large facility with separate project areas set up and workstations for all staff members. What I rapidly discovered is unique about production at SUNCOM is that the work is divided into component tasks since an assembly line is not possible. Each worker goes at their own speed which can vary widely, hence an assembly line process is not feasible. So, workers were set up in areas to assemble boxes, cut bubble wrap segments to size, assemble complete packages, and seal packages. The area where they handle The Bacon Jams project had about 20 workstations and each worker was ready to go as we confirmed the final process and began production. Some were quite fast, and others took their time to get comfortable, but a pace was quickly established. Counselors assisted workers as needed and checked all work as it progressed to record the productivity of each production worker so they can be paid for their work. It was a very simple, clean, and practical environment without any frills or fancy extras. Check out the video if you would like to see the environment.
After getting started and into the groove, the SUNCOM production force began to ask questions about The Bacon Jams. They wanted to know what it is, where it is sold, how we invented such a tasty treat, and most important of all, the name of our mascot. The joy they showed upon learning that the name of the our pig mascot was James was infectious. Sometimes simple joy can provide a stark reminder that there is much to be happy about in life overall. When the SUNCOM staff learned the product they were working on was going to be on TV, they were thrilled to be working on something so glamorous.
One of the best parts of the day for someone like me, who has been caught up in the daily pressure of planning for a big project like this, was when members of the SUNCOM staff approached me and genuinely thanked me for bringing such exciting work to them. The joy they expressed when completing the job made my day an uplifting one. We made sure everyone who worked on the project was offered a jar of The Bacon Jams to take home & next time we produced there, Mike has promised to make a Bacon Jams themed lunch.

The Bacon Jams will be sold on QVC for the first time this month! The deal they will be offering is fantastic! A three jar sampler pack with our full-color recipe guide shipped to your door for under $40. We want to let all of our friends, family, and valued customers know about this awesome deal. Please support us in this very large step for our very humble company.
Now that I got the bits and pieces out of the way, let's talk about how we got here.
Back in the early days of The Bacon Jam, when we were spreading bacon spread in Love Park Christmas Village while freezing our hams off, a lady tried the bacon jam and said, ""You should sell this on TV!"" A month or so later at the Oaks Motor Sport Show, a man tried the bacon jam and said, ""you should sell this on TV."" Welp, turns out the lady's husband works for QVC... Also, turns out the man was long time host Dan Hughes!
We got some emails from this retail juggernaut, but we knew we weren't ready, just yet. So, over the last year, we got our piggies in a row and reached back out to the largest on-air shopping network in the world!
The next thing you know, I'm in a room with 6 other guests training with QVC's pros. No, not like Pilates training, I was training to not be a creep on live TV. In walks Dan Hughes... He sees my name plate and does a double take. He walks over to shake my hand. ""I've been waiting for you to show up in this class ever since the car show."" At this point, I am a little embarrassed about being singled out. Dan then said something that made me feel proud. ""America is going to love this product.""
Please support us as we take our company to the national stage this October!

Slowly but surely, folks, and what better way to start our journey to (condiment) world domination than with the world’s largest broadcast shopping network?

Plus, The Bacon Jams and QVC are neighbors in West Chester, Pennsylvania, so this is destiny.

It includes some of Chef Mike's favorite dishes like Bacon jam-infused mac ‘n cheese, scallops, burger sliders, french toast, loaded baked potatoes, stuffed pears and more, it’s all in there. The price will be killer and you will not find the bacon jams priced this low anywhere.
So come one, come all, and watch us on QVC on Monday, October 13, on the 5pm-6pm gourmet food show. We should be the second item. Buy some of your favorite bacon jam, too! You’ll want to be able to say you were in on The Bacon Jams before we were cool."

It’s been a little over one year since The Bacon Jams began operations, and their home base has treated them quite well thus far. The company has not ventured outside the United States just yet and, unfortunately, we can’t bring the jars in our luggage on planes. Instead, Mike O. did the next best thing and took our special holiday three-pack bacon jam sampler packaging with him on his trip to Italy last week. Let’s call it a maiden voyage of sorts. Mike was nice enough to commemorate takeoff with a photo. No word on whether the box got its own seat.
Once arriving in Italy, Mike went right into vacation mode. The hiking was extraordinary, the scenery breathtaking, the living most enjoyable. He took the new packaging everywhere, just one of the fellas hitching along. The pink, slick piece of cardboard found enough fun stuff to do, hanging with his cool aardvark buddy and being nice enough to prop up the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
There was plenty of delicious food too, even without bacon jam. Mike spread the gospel of bacon jams to the locals and was sure to get their input on the product. Europeans are used to spreadable foods and especially pâtés, which is precisely where bacon jam would fit. Everyone was receptive to the idea of spreadable bacon, it just made sense and yet there’s nothing like it on the market. Naturally, they wanted to taste the goods. Some day. There are huge international food expos in Europe, and we’ll get there. For now we have America to conquer first.

As Year Two of The Bacon Jams kicks off with another wonderful holiday season, the company is pleased and excited to offer a pair of newly branded products for sale -- Bacon Caramel Popcorn (directed by Red Fox) and Himalayan Bacon Salt Blend. The Bacon Caramel Popcorn is for snacking on the go, coming in small ($5) and large ($10) options, while the Himalayan bacon salt is for seasoning your favorites foods and comes in a two-ounce packet ($5).
I devoured my first bag of Bacon Caramel Popcorn in less than five minutes, instantly regretting opting for the small over the large. The sweetness of the caramel coating the popped kernels meshes perfectly with the salty smokiness of the bacon bits. My taste buds were doing backflips, my brain telling me, “You’ve got a winner right here -- pitch this bad boy to movie theaters after the holidays are over!” You know what, brain, you just might be on to something.
I got home that same night and gave the Himalayan Bacon Salt a whirl. I decided to make chicken, and there was no doubt what the rub-seasoning combination would be: Red Chile & Garlic bacon jam and Himalayan bacon salt! I lathered the chicken in the RCG and then applied the HBS, watching and perhaps even drooling a little bit as I drizzled the Himalayan pink salt crystals on top. The smoky taste of the RCG and salt-black pepper-bacon seasoning of the HBS made for a delicious flavor... It was the best dinner I had all week.
But don’t just take my word for it. Want to get your hands on the two newest members of The Bacon Jams family? Hit us up on the web or stop by either of our mall kiosks (King of Prussia and Christiana) or our booths in Christmas Village (Love Park) or Philly Phair (Franklin Square).

When does a company start believing it’s on the cusp of taking that next step and realizing its dreams?

It’s true what they say -- time flies when you’re having fun, and we had tons of fun during the 2014 holiday season!
Even though the “official” holiday season started with Thanksgiving, The Bacon Jams’ holiday season started on November 1, when we opened our kiosks at the King of Prussia and Christiana Malls. Four weeks later, on Black Friday, we opened our booths in downtown Philadelphia at Christmas Village in Love Park and Philly Phair in Franklin Square. Every day, rain or shine, we were out there spreading the bacon jam gospel. All told, the four locations banded together to achieve a synergy of sales that had us jammin’ straight through Christmas and ecstatic about our direction for 2015. We even were sent pictures of our jars on social media from happy customers who had received them as gifts on Christmas morning -- including one from the United Kingdom! That was pretty cool.
While it’s a bummer that the holidays and accompanying festivities are over, we don’t intend on slowing down. Our King of Prussia and Christiana Mall locations are open throughout the month of January, and we’ll be slingin’ bacon jam with the same gusto that we did in November and December. If you’re a fan of ours on the West Coast, we’re headed to the Winter Fancy Food Show in San Francisco, which runs January 11-13. Right after, we’ll be back in our hometown at the Philadelphia Home Show in the Pennsylvania Convention Center, January 17-19 and 23-25.
As always, thanks for being part of the ride and helping us get to this point. Strap in, bigger and better things await this upcoming year.~DK"

My house threw a rockin’ New Years party in the Graduate Hospital section of Philadelphia, and The Bacon Jams was gracious enough to serve as a sponsor. Guests began arriving around 8 at night on December 31 and, in addition to liquor and beer, were greeted by a beautiful spread of cheese, crackers, pita, hummus and other assorted finger foods that sat on a table against the wall in the dining room. Naturally, there were three jars of The Bacon Jams -- one of each variety -- strategically situated alongside the platters.
As the house started to fill up with partygoers, so too did an appetite for food and drink. I got the snacking started and led the charge with pita and a hummus-Black Pepper bacon jam combo. Anyone who saw the table and asked, “What’s bacon jam?!”, was funneled my way for the pitch. I counted 12 separate inquiring minds who wanted to know, and that was before things really got bumping and everyone became more concerned with imbibing than eating. Everyone who tried loved the jams, but there were two people whose enthusiasm really stood out to me: Regan and Jarrett. Regan didn’t need much convincing and was in from the start; enthralled and excited by the concept of bacon jam, she wanted to know everything about the product and I was happy to oblige. After giving her my spiel about each variety, she chose to give Red Chile & Garlic a shot first and asked which food on the table would be the best vessel for trying.
“Cheese and cracker,” I said without hesitation.
So she picked up a circular Ritz cracker and a cheddar cheese square and spread some Red Chile & Garlic bacon jam on top.
“Oh my God,” she exclaimed as her eyes lit up. “I was expecting this to be amazing and it’s even better than that!” Within seconds, her plate had a bunch of crackers, cheese pieces and a glob of Red Chile & Garlic bacon jam.
Jarrett, more skeptical, was next. He too chose Red Chile & Garlic on top of a cracker with cheese and popped it into his mouth.
“Alright, this is pretty good stuff,” he said, cracking a smile.
“I know, man, I told you!” I replied.
Both Regan and Jarrett went on to also sample the All Original and Black Pepper with cheese, crackers, pita and hummus, and each time their reaction was the same: Unanimous approval.
As we were cleaning up the following afternoon, my roommate yelled to me from downstairs: “Hey, Dan, the All Original jar is just about empty!”
Let’s hope that’s an auspicious sign for The Bacon Jams in 2015!

This Sunday, January 11, marks the start of the 40th annual three-day Winter Fancy Food Show, presented by Specialty Food Association, at The Moscone Center in San Francisco and The Bacon Jams, LLC is exhilarated to take part. It runs from 10 am - 5 pm on Sunday and Monday, and from 10 am - 4 pm on Tuesday. The Winter Fancy Food Show is the West Coast’s largest specialty food and beverage trade show, the kind of event that can help us take the next monumental step in our efforts to expand nationally and make everyone know the name “The Bacon Jams.”
There will be more than 80,000 specialty food products and 1,400 exhibitors from all over the United States and the world attending. In order to be truly recognized and differentiate yourself from the pack, your product needs to be unique, it needs to pop and it needs to be loved. Check, check and check. Everywhere we’ve gone, our bacon jam has been positively received and adored by the masses. Hopefully, the Winter Fancy Food Show continues that trend, and we are set up beautifully as one of the top-three featured “New Brands on the Shelf” in the emerging food entrepreneurs section. Plus, this weekend at the event is when we will be launching our food service channel, so, to all you restaurants, keep an eye out and consider making our delectable spreadable bacon part of your dishes!
The four Executive Boars -- Bruce, Mike, Eric and Jeff -- will all be there to ring in the second full year of operations for The Bacon Jams, one in which the company will do everything in its power to soar to new heights, to establish itself as a force and make an indelible imprint on the food industry."

It was a three-day whirlwind of great food, drink, people and fun out in San Francisco during the Specialty Food Association’s 40th Winter Fancy Food Show 2015. With over 1,400 exhibitors and 19,000 attendees, there was no shortage of exposure and eyeballs -- no shortage of opportunity to get noticed. We went in with hopeful yet considerable expectations, confident in our product but also understanding of our standing as one of the new kids on the block. Luckily, though not surprisingly, our bacon jams were positively received and the subject of favorable publicity from some significant influencers, including ”Food Beast,” ”Food Business News” and ”San Francisco Business Times,” the latter of which labeled us as an “innovator.” Why, thank you :-)
Oh, and we picked up a bunch of new accounts in the process. San Francisco was wonderful, and we’ll be back. This was just the first step in our westward expansion, as we continue to canvass the area to get into stores and participate in all kinds of markets and events. Up next: Dallas and Seattle. Be sure to look for us!"

Remember our appearance on QVC’s “Gourmet Foods Show” in October? It was a groundbreaking event for The Bacon Jams and our first national television exposure. To get recognized by the world’s foremost home-shopping network was an incredible honor, and we were anxious yet confident that our product would pass the test. The seven-minute segment was a whirlwind of bacon jam tasting -- on all kinds of foods -- and adoration. We knew it went well then, but the true litmus test would be whether and when we got invited to come back.
Well, we’ve got some great news: A little over three months later, QVC has summoned us again... this time to take part in their “Food Fest” program from 4-5 pm on Wednesday, January 28. This is yet another step up for us on that proverbial ladder as we attempt to make our mark in the industry and spread bacon jam to the national consciousness.
For those of you who have been with us the whole way, we thank you once again for your undying support and for spreading the word. We know you will be watching us Wednesday on QVC. For those who don’t know us yet, tune in to “Food Fest,” order a sampler pack of our bacon jams delivered right to your house and see what all the buzz is about!"

Chocolate has always been the food staple of Valentine’s Day, but we think a change is in order. Nothing against chocolate, of course, but it’s time for something new! So how about we tinker with the idea of introducing, you guessed it, bacon as the official food for Valentine’s Day 2015. Specifically, bacon jam. No, it’s not traditional, but traditional is boring. Bacon jam is fun, exciting, unique and unfailingly enjoyable -- just like that special someone in your life with whom you’ll be spending this special day!
If your significant other is a bacon lover, get him or her The Bacon Jams. And, listen, this doesn’t mean you can’t get chocolate in addition. Everyone gets chocolate. So here’s how you can do both: Mix bacon jam with chocolate. We suggest some bacon jam brownies, with our All Original variety as part of the batter.
For guys: As for flowers, well, is there really any other option aside from chocolate-dipped bacon roses? Might as well slather those with bacon jam, too! Make it a true bacon jam bonanza. (You should probably also get real roses, just so you don’t have to sleep on the couch.)
Be sure to check out the store locator if you want to visit one of our retailers. If you’re not within an easy distance or simply prefer to have the jams sent to your house, order online from our website!
No matter what happens and how you choose to celebrate, from all of us at The Bacon Jams to you: Have a happy, healthy and lovely Valentine’s Day!"

I got the call at 1:00 AM on Monday. Yes, one o’clock in the morning.
“I heard about your bacon jams, they’re all I’ve been able to think about,” came from a booming yet soothing baritone. “Get on your way down to Washington so you can be here in time for breakfast. Bring one of each flavor with you.”
Disoriented and confused if I was dreaming or really awake, my initial instinct was to correct him and say we prefer to refer to them as “varieties” instead of “flavors.” Instead, I managed to get out the most natural words:
“Uh, who is this?”
“Seriously, how do you not recognize this voice? It’s Barack Obama, and I want The Bacon Jams for my Presidents’ Day breakfast! 5:30 AM sharp, be here.”
Then he hung up.
I sat there frozen, dazed and dumbfounded for what felt like forever. Ha, very funny. No doubt that one of my friends, off from work Monday and out on the town imbibing, was playing a practical joke on me. Why would the President even be up at 1:00 AM?! Then I checked the source number on my phone, 202-456-1111.
Google confirmed what my brain refused to comprehend: The call had come directly from the White House. Could this all be some kind of practical joke? Of course, highly likely in fact, but I didn’t need more convincing. I sprang out of bed, shaved, showered, brushed my teeth, threw on both my pink James Bacon and Bacon American Flag shirts for good luck with a full suit over top, put a few three-pack samplers with recipe guides into pink bags and hopped in my car. I was on the road to D.C. by 2:00, not sure what I was doing and fully understanding I was crazy — but also knowing it was a risk I had to take.
The ride was relaxing and pensive. Just me, darkness and the open road of I-95 South. What would I say? What would I tell him to put The Bacon Jams on first? Could we play basketball after??? You know, if he didn’t have a National Security Council meeting or something.
I got a coffee at a 24-hour rest stop in northern Maryland to keep me going. The inquisitive lady behind the counter rightfully asked where I was headed in a full suit at such an hour.
“You wouldn’t believe me if I told you,” I said.
“Try me.”
“I’m going to have breakfast with Barack Obama.”
“ … As in President Barack Obama?”
“Yeah, that’s the one.”
“Sure, ok. Have fun with that, you weirdo.”
I arrived outside the White House and parked on a nearby side street at 4:30, an hour before breakfast was scheduled to start. I approached the gate in the frigid cold — a guy in a suit and overcoat, holding two pink bags under the pitch-black shroud of the early morning hours. More bizarre than anything, I still must have broken the 1-10 scale for suspiciousness.
Here goes nothing, I thought, as I slowly moved my trembling finger towards the intercom button.
*Buzz*
One second passed, then another. It might as well have been an eternity. I was going to have to turn around, walk back to my car, drive home to Philly in immense shame and pretend this never happened.
“State your business,” the voice on the other end ordered abruptly.
“Um… well… I know this is going to sound ridiculous… ah screw it, I have bacon jam here for the President’s breakfast.”
“Oh! Wonderful, he said he’d be expecting you. I can’t wait to try your bacon jams myself! Please, come in.”
The gate opened and I walked through, pinching myself the whole way up to the main entrance since there’s no possible way this was real life.
I was greeted at the door by two members of the Secret Service, patted down and searched. The jars of bacon jam were opened and inspected. Then one of the Secret Service men, belying his stoic nature and grinning ever so slightly, said he had to taste each one just to make sure they weren’t poisonous.
“This is some good… well, you know,” he remarked. “The President’s gonna love these.”
I was led to a private dining room and observed the layout. It did not disappoint, as every breakfast food known to man was there. Soon after, the door swung open and that familiar voice bellowed, “Let’s break out The Bacon Jams!”
I swiveled around, took a deep breath and tried not to trip over myself as I approached him with my open hand extended.
“Hello, Mr. President,” I said as we shook. “Thank you so much for inviting me and wanting to try our jams. I can’t wait to get started.”
“I’m a huge bacon fan, and I’ll give anything with bacon a shot,” he said. “Oh, and call me Barack.”
“You got it, Mr. President!”
First up: Eggs. True to form, he went with the Mediterranean omelette. Grape tomatoes, scallions, olives and feta cheese. He turned towards me, and I knew what I had to do.
“Scoop some of this Black Pepper in there, my man,” I instructed the chef as I handed him the jar.
Next: Hash browns. Time for Red Chile & Garlic, which the chef combined with olive oil to coat the skillet before adding the julienned potatoes.
Lastly: Fruit. I urged the mixture of the sweet All Original with a pineapple, melon and strawberry medley.
As we sat down to enjoy our meals, a side of toast and a few strips of bacon were placed in front of the President.
“Put all three bacon jams on the toast and on the bacon strips,” I suggested. “Trust me.”
Obama did just that, then cut a piece of the omelette, put a strip of bacon on top and slapped both onto the piece of toast. As he raised the mini open sandwich to his mouth, I started to sweat in nervous anticipation and closed my eyes. What if he didn’t like it? What if I had just ruined his whole breakfast? What if I came all this way for failure? What if I’m about to get awkwardly escorted out of the White House by the Secret Service?
*Crunch*
“Oh my, are you kidding me?!”
I opened my eyes just in time to see an ear-to-ear smile spread across the President's face.
“Yeah, that hits the spot,” he said, beaming with foodphoria (made-up word that should become a real word). “I can’t believe I’ve been doing breakfast without The Bacon Jams all this time!”
*Exhale*
He devoured the rest of his breakfast, adding bacon jam to anything and everything.
“Even if I only have time for toast in the morning, this is going on it,” he said.
“Well, which of The Bacon Jams varieties was your favorite?” I asked.
“Come on, that’s like asking me to choose between Michelle, Malia and Sasha,” he responded. “I love all three equally.”
After finishing breakfast, Obama turned to me and asked, “Hey, you want to shoot hoops real quick?”
My eyes lit up.
“OF COURSE!” I exclaimed.
“Just kidding,” he chuckled. “I have a National Security Council meeting right now. Maybe next time. I really do love The Bacon Jams, though, and appreciate you making the trip down. I can’t wait to put this stuff on my lunch and dinner foods — burgers, steak, ribs, salmon, scallops, think of all the possibilities! It’s going to be on every table, a staple accompanying each meal. Be sure to keep the White House fully stocked with The Bacon Jams at all times.”
We shook hands again and said goodbye. Just like that, he was on his way towards the door.
“Wait!” I yelled after him, undoing my tie and unbuttoning my shirt to reveal the Bacon American Flag tee. “I have to leave this with you.”
Obama squinted to get a better look, as it registered in his head that the stripes on the flag were bacon strips.
“Yes, you certainly do!” He replied with vigor. “That’s awesome. I mean, it doesn’t get any more American than bacon and the flag of the United States combined into one. Make sure you send more of those shirts with the jams.”
The whirlwind of that morning still hasn’t hit me. It was so surreal, so ludicrous, that I still don’t believe it happened.
The only bummer is that the Secret Service forbade me from taking pictures, understandably.
“Come on, guys, you know how well this will play on social media — think about our brand!” I begged and pleaded, to no avail.
I guess you'll just have to take my word for it."
https://tbjgourmet.com/blogs/news/17531029-i-am-your-bacon-jam-champion,"I Am Your (Bacon Jam) Champion!
“I am your champion! Look no further!”
That was the title of John McGraw’s email. No boring, boilerplate “John McGraw’s Resume.” Note to everyone out there: This is how you grab the attention of a prospective employer. Our interest was piqued before even seeing what John had to say, and the contents of the email proved we had found the perfect man for the job. He even included a GIF of a dancing strip of bacon at the end!
We posted an ad on Craigslist in December for a West Coast sales and business development representative. The Winter Fancy Foods Show in San Francisco was set for the second weekend in January, and that is where we wanted to vet candidates in person. We said we were “looking for champions.” Plenty of people responded to the ad, but no one came in guns blazing like John did, boasting the combination of experience, confidence and aggressiveness necessary to attack the intimidating yet bountiful West Coast market.
“When we met John (at Winter Fancy Foods Show), we knew immediately,” Executive Boar Mike O. said. “He picked up it so easily, he was a natural. Within seconds, he was pitching and selling to everyone who passed by the booth. He knew everything about the product. We’d look down and then look back up seconds later and John had roped in another person or group of people. It was like he’d been selling The Bacon Jams his whole life. We’re feeling really confident about him.”
A Bay Area native and successful entrepreneur in the foodservice industry, McGraw co-founded and managed a chain of creperies in the San Francisco Financial District. He then moved to Costa Rica, where he opened and operated an all-in-one hotel, bar and restaurant. Upon returning to the States, he helped launch a specialty wine company dedicated to supporting charities. John then came full circle, moving back to the foodservice industry and serving as a cook at a local San Francisco restaurant. But now, with 2015 underway, he’s ready for his next endeavor: Spreading The Bacon Jams throughout California!
“The Bacon Jams is a great substitute for bacon,” McGraw said. “Ease of use is what jumps out to me most. I come from big foodservice stuff, and bacon is very expensive. There's labor costs, there's cooking, there's storage, keeping it fresh. This is a great alternative. It doesn't completely replace bacon, but I would say it replaces 50 percent of uses. It’s cheaper, which is obviously huge, and has all kinds of uses for food production that goes beyond regular bacon.”
If you see a hot pink The Bacon Jams tent or banner, that’s John McGraw. If someone is coming into your store to sell you The Bacon Jams, you’re gonna be talking to John McGraw. If someone is calling your restaurant about adding The Bacon Jams to your menu, it’s John McGraw. He crushed his first ever event last weekend, SF Craft Beer Festival in San Francisco. Next up: Bacon and Beer Classic in San Jose on Saturday, March 21.
John McGraw is an All-American man, with an All-American name, representing the All-American spread, and he won’t stop until the whole state of California is bacon jam-ized.
""I've been putting The Bacon Jams on all my sandwiches, and I love it with brie cheese,"" McGraw said. ""It's a great item for events, social gatherings, in the kitchen and applicable everywhere. It's fun, people get excited about bacon. Being in California and having a chance to introduce The Bacon Jams here, there’s huge market potential that really appeals to me and offers a large opportunity. This is what I do. I’m excited.”"
https://tbjgourmet.com/blogs/news/17897461-the-bacon-jams-hustle,"The Bacon Jams Hustle
It was the weekend of March 13-15, one that will go down in the history books years from now when the story of The Bacon Jams’ meteoric rise to spreadable success is written.
I went to New York City for two events spanning three days. The first was NYC Craft Beer Fest in Manhattan, which had three sessions — one Friday night and two on Saturday. The second was Long Island Bacon Fest in Coram. I packed my Honda CR-V Friday afternoon with inventory and set out on my way. Two-and-a-half hours and a jammed Lincoln Tunnel later, I arrived at 69th Regiment Armory with two hours left before the start of the first session of the NYC Craft Beer Fest. I double-parked at the edge of the intersection of 26th Street and Lexington Avenue, put on the hazard lights and rushed inside. I procured a hand cart and went back out to my car for one of the three trips I’d make to unload everything I needed. Half-an-hour later, and nervous with a New York City Parking Authority employee writing a ticket for a car on the other side of the street, I got back in my car and sought a more permanent (sort of) parking spot one block down. I had eight cases of product and an external battery left in the car, which required another two trips for transportation. I was all set up with about 40 minutes left before the VIP session began at 7. Having not eaten since breakfast, I grabbed a hoagie — er, hero — and coffee from the convenience store across the street and wolfed and chugged them down, respectively.
Things started slowly with only one sale in the first hour-and-a-half despite copious samplings and unanimous approval. However, as is the norm with beer events, people came back in droves after having their fill of brews, ready to buy The Bacon Jams. It was a rapid revelation. On average, I made a sale every 3.24 minutes in the final two hours. This was my first big event in New York City, and I had no idea what to expect. By the end of the first session, I had an inkling I was going to be in for a long — LONG — Saturday night.
The two Saturday sessions at NYC Craft Beer Fest surpassed the frenzied pace of Friday evening. Forget inkling, by the end of the first Saturday session, I knew I had not properly anticipated the amount of inventory I’d be able to sell. When the Saturday evening session began, I had already accepted my fate: As soon as the event ended and I was done cleaning up and breaking down, I’d be driving the two hours back to the warehouse in Bridgeport (PA) to reload with inventory, then turning around and immediately trekking to Long Island for Sunday. I got in the car at 10:30 PM and left Manhattan, headed for the New Jersey Turnpike. Without any traffic, I put a little pedal to the metal and arrived at the warehouse in Bridgeport at 12:22. Under the clear night sky and in brisk temperatures, I loaded up the trunk with more cases of All Original, Red Chile & Garlic and Black Pepper. I stopped at Wawa around the corner for a coffee, banana and 5-Hour Energy before resuming my journey around 2. The roads were empty, my mood was calm and I felt at peace. I was doing what I had to do. Hustle, hustle and more hustle. Besides, I had nobody to blame but myself for my predicament. Perhaps it was a blessing in disguise, a key learning moment in what it takes to build and grow a small business you believe in during a critical juncture in its development. I used the hours of solitude in the car to contemplate my vision for the future of The Bacon Jams. One of those goals years down the line: Become The Official Spread of the NFL. Forget half-a-point, it’s half-a-pound… of bacon! But I digress.
I arrived in Coram, New York, at 4:58. It was still dark out, and I wanted to get at least a little nap in before setup for the Long Island Bacon Fest started at 7. So I did what any rational person would: I looked for a parking lot where I could clandestinely catch some shuteye. The Hampton Inn was full of cars and had a security guard patrolling the perimeter. After a brief drive-through, I turned onto the attached road that led to a senior living center. I pulled into the parking spot at 5:25, reclined my seat, used my jacket as a blanket, set my alarm for 6:50 and closed my eyes.
You’re out of your *bleeping* mind, I thought to myself, before I drifted to sleep. Everyone to whom I’ve told the story thinks I’m insane, and they’re right, but what other recourse did I have?
The alarm rang at 6:50 and I sprang awake. No hitting the “snooze” button like usual. I put my seat back up and looked to my right. I don’t know when this woman pulled into the adjacent spot, but she was looking directly at me through her window. Busted.
Whatever.
I no-keys-push-to-started the car and high-tailed it out of there. Ten minutes later, I arrived at All Star Arena, where the event was being held, and began the unloading and setup process. I was done by 8 and grabbed a bagel and coffee from across the street. The event was to start at 10, and already by 9 a long line had formed. By the time the doors opened, that line had snaked around the block. From the very beginning, it was obvious this event would be an entirely different, more gargantuan and voracious beast than the NYC Craft Beer Fest.
Each of the first four people to approach the stand and sample bought gift packs. Boom, $180 in sales in five minutes. Things picked up from there. I was on my feet for six hours straight from 10-4. The line consistently went 50-60 deep, with some folks waiting upwards of 30 minutes to get a taste of The Bacon Jams. I started with 12 cases of All Original, 10 cases of Red Chile & Garlic and 8 cases of Black Pepper. At six jars per case, that’s a total of 180. By 12:30, I was completely out of the All Original. Operating solo and with a line of potential customers that was only growing, I announced that I had to go to my car to get the other cases of All Original I brought with me and pleaded for a little patience. My neighbor, Michael Rogak of the famous Jomart Chocolates in Brooklyn (selling chocolate-covered bacon at the event), was gracious enough to step in and take over sampling despite not exactly knowing, well, anything about the product.
“I’ve heard you say the same thing over and over for hours,” he said. “I can do this for a few minutes.”
“You’re the man,” I exalted, before running outside.
After returning with the rest of the inventory five minutes later, I profusely thanked Michael and resumed sampling and selling with a level of vigor that would’ve made the Energizer Bunny envious. By 2, the rest of the All Original had sold out too, but the line remained robust. People didn’t care, they wanted our bacon jams. Only have Red Chile & Garlic and Black Pepper left? Cool, those are also amazing, take my money and give them to me. Things started to slow down, finally, at 4 as the crowd thinned out. I had four total cases of product left in the booth after completing my final sale at 4:30 and, for the first time in six-and-a-half hours, sat down and took a deep breath. Michael, who had his two daughters there helping him, looked over as I slouched backwards in the seat with my arms hanging at my sides.
“I’ve never seen anything like what you just did on your own,” he said. “I got exhausted watching you. Tremendous job. That was some serious hustle.”
“Thanks, man, I had no idea what to expect here and really appreciate that,” I replied. “Now, let’s talk about getting our sweet All Original bacon jam into your store for both retail and inclusion in your confectionary creations.”
Michael smiled and handed me his card. “We’ll be in touch,” he said.
I then got a phone call from Papa Boar Bruce.
“Are… are these sales numbers accurate?” He asked, incredulously.
“Yes, they are,” I replied. “I know, complete and utter insanity.”
“Holy… wow!” Bruce exclaimed. “We’ve gotta be in New York.”
“No question,” I said. “And I’m going to make it happen.”
I cleaned the booth, loaded up my car, chugged the 5-Hour Energy I strategically bought the night before and started the three-hour drive home to Philadelphia. A spectacularly successful weekend and one hell of a story. New York loves The Bacon Jams, and The Bacon Jams loves New York! I wouldn’t say I felt satisfied by my accomplishments that weekend, so much as motivated to establish a retail presence in New York and infiltrate the market permanently.
I woke up the next morning and emailed Michael to thank him again for his assistance and for being a good guy in general.
“It's always best at a festival (and in life) to have a good neighbor,” he wrote back. “I am glad all worked out well for all of us.”
I returned to New York on Thursday night, March 19, for the Spring Craft Beer Festival at Nassau Coliseum on Long Island on Saturday, March 21. But first, on Friday morning, I made a special visit to Jomart Chocolates to see Michael. He graciously welcomed me to the store and gave me a full tour. We reminisced about the event and then spoke about life, business and where we might cross paths again. I left a jar of All Original for sampling and told him to include it in cakes, brownies, cookies, everything they make. I also told him if he’s not interested in wholesale for retail purposes, we could talk about foodservice when we launch that channel in the upcoming months.
Oh, by the way: We sold out of All Original and Red Chile & Garlic at the Spring Craft Beer Festival on Saturday.
Hey, New York City: The Bacon Jams is coming.

The 4th of July is definitely one of the greatest days of the year. A day off work, a time to get together with family and friends and a time to pay homage to our great country. We do this in old school American fashion, with outdoor lounging and most importantly, barbequing. When I think of the 4th of July I immediately think about putting charcoal into the grill, marinating my various meats and entering my BBQ persona as the Grill Sergeant. There is always something very rewarding about making your own meal and grilling is one the easiest and tastiest ways of going about achieving this pleasure. But this year I knew the Independence Day experience would be even more satisfying as I would be introducing the most delicious ingredient to the grill, The Bacon Jams. I recently began working for The Bacon Jams and as a bacon fanatic I could not wait to try the product on everything I cooked especially my 4th of July BBQ. The idea of spreadable bacon is mind-blowing, but when I tried a jar of the All Original flavor I immediately knew I struck gold and my cooking would never be the same. One of my favorite things about The Bacon Jams is that it is so versatile. I like to use it in as many ways as possible when I am cooking. First I take The Bacon Jams’ black pepper flavor and marinate it with my ground beef. This gives it a strong and bold taste to the meat that goes great when paired with a pepper jack cheese melted on top. The response from my friends when they tasted the burgers was everything I imagined, “how did you make these” and, “these are delicious, where do I get this?” I owe it all to The Bacon Jams for making my burgers the talk of the weekend. In addition to mixing the black pepper with my meats, I also applied the All Original Flavor on top of my hot dogs to give it a sweet tangy taste for an engaging substitute to ketchup and mustard.
The Bacon Jams can be used both as an ingredient and a condiment and when I have a chance to use two different flavors in such an awesome way, I can’t help myself! Now all of my friends are asking where they can get their own jars of bacon happiness. It is always an exciting feeling when you are cooking your own food and you surprise yourself with what you have made. This surprise was made incredibly easy with a jar of The Bacon Jams. This goes without saying, but it was a 4th of July to remember and one my friends’ pallets won’t soon be forgetting. The standard has been set this 4th of July of what is to be expected when grilling this summer and this standard is called The Bacon Jams.

This past weekend two of my best friends got engaged. Marriage is one of the most joyous things one can experience and getting engaged is the beginning of this amazing journey for them. To celebrate this announcement they decided to have all of their friends over on Saturday night for finger foods, beer and cocktails. I knew immediately the best way to usher in this new stage of their lives was to engage their taste buds with The Bacon Jams. I came over a little early and set up all three jars of the different flavors of bacon jams: All Original, Red Chile & Garlic and Black Pepper.
As the first guests arrived and started to get settled in, they quickly moved on to the snack station. All the essentials were laid out there, pretzels, pita chips and baked lays. In front of them were the three flavors of bacon perfection. The first thing everyone said was, “Wait, what is this?” and “Spreadable bacon? Is it good?” I didn’t need to provide any reassurances as they quickly answered their own questions after their first taste. The comments quickly became, “Oh my God!” and “I need to walk away or I’m going to eat the whole jar”. Luckily I did manage to walk out of there with a little bit left in each jar because a small amount of these jams packs such a strong taste.
The night dwindled down and everyone had their fair share of jams. It was a great night enjoyed with great friends. The buzz over the engagement created excitement in the air that night, but The Bacon Jams was literally on the tip of almost everyone’s tongue. Bacon jam proved to be a great snack to share with great friends to celebrate marriage!"

The Bacon Jams was started in late 2013, just launched its foodservice channel and is rapidly expanding! Mike Oraschewsky, Chief Executive Boar, took some time out of his day to tell us about how The Bacon Jams became the company it is today. Mike has his hands in almost everything The Bacon Jams does, from daily operations to marketing to head chef.
When and how did you get into food services?
I started bussing tables when I was 14 years old and worked in restaurants throughout high school and college. I worked my way from busboy to waiter to bartender to kitchen. Cooking and the foodservice industry is something that was always around me from a very young age. My father was a chef in his younger years, and his father was also a chef. Cooking is something that has been passed down through the family.
When did you start The Bacon Jams?
After college, I worked for a company for six months before quitting and opening my first restaurant at age 23. After 10 years of running this restaurant, I sold it and expanded in other directions in the food industry. It was right around this time that I was introduced to Bruce Kramer and his homemade bacon jam. First we used this recipe at my restaurant and it was so successful that, after narrowing it down to our three main flavors, we decided to create a Kickstarter to raise money for The Bacon Jams as its own independent company. Within the first 30 days of the Kickstarter campaign, we raised $15,000.
After our successful Kickstarter campaign, we hit the road and headed to The Virginia Beach Bacon Festival. We packed up the car, filling it with as much product as it could carry and came away from the event with an empty car. After this amazing event, we started to look for places to sell The Bacon Jams. I remember in the beginning days of The Bacon Jams being in the kitchen every night cooking bacon jam until the sun came up. We hit our stride and made a name for ourselves at the Love Park Christmas Village in Center City Philadelphia. Bundled up in the cold winter days and nights, we really started to sell substantial amounts of The Bacon Jams and spread the word of bacon jam goodness to the masses.
Where do you see The Bacon Jams going in the future?
I see The Bacon Jams as a regular item on every menu of every restaurant that cares about their customers. I also see it on the shelves of every gourmet retail store. This is something that we are already progressing with, as The Bacon Jams are sold in 46 states and distributed in over 500 retail locations.

October 6 2017·
So now that nearly everyone in America who matters knows what bacon jam is, the question comes up, are all bacon jams created equal? The answer is no, no they are not. I will tell you why my bacon jam is the best and then you can judge for yourself!
1. The best bacon jam has bacon as the #1 ingredient.
2. Bacon jam should be made with only the best bacon. Why do something if you are not going to do it right, right?
3. Bacon jam should be jam like in that it can be spread, squeezed and “poured” with assistance from a handy spoon
4. Bacon jam should not have fat or lard at the top of the container after it cools. Not only is it unseemly, but it means your flavors have separated. Flavors want to be together on this one
5. Bacon jam should be made with love. Love of the pig, love of the recipe, love of the people with whom you are going to share it.

It’s November and that means one thing… Thanksgiving is upon us! Being a food fanatic only makes this day more eventful as the chopping boards come out to see which family member can create this year’s standout dish. In my family we have 3 cooks who like to be in control of certain dishes. My father “owns” the kitchen when it comes to the stuffing and the all-important turkey. He uses a hockey style hip-check to keep me away from the bird because he knows I like to pick at the finished meat before anyone else. I hold the positions of mashed potatoes expert as well as the green bean casserole architect. My older brother, an Executive Boar for The Bacon Jams, makes sure every dish being served has been taste tested, multiple times, to insure quality is up to our family’s high standards. This year is going to be an exciting time for the family because our special ingredient is going to be The Bacon Jams! Our task is simple; use any of the different varieties of The Bacon Jams in each dish to create a beautifully bacon Thanksgiving! Mike, my older brother, has the upper hand because he works with The Bacon Jams everyday but my father and I are not phased. I already know that I will be putting the “Red Chile and Garlic” Bacon Jam in my mashed potatoes to add for an exciting flavor boost. I will also be using the “Black Pepper” Bacon Jam on my green bean casserole as a final touch! The Bacon Jams offer foodies the ultimate bacon product to use in any and every dish whether it is Thanksgiving dinner or a quick lunch that needs some transforming bacon spread added. It also makes for an intriguing present to bacon lovers who cannot get enough bacon in their lives (we all have that family member). This Thanksgiving is going to be filled with family fun and sweet spreadable bacon, what more can you ask for!"

Hi Jammers thanks for reading our first Bacon Jam blog post… Blam! This is where you will be able to get TBJ news, inside info, and fan fiction. As most of you know we have been working hard on The Bacon Jams for some time now and our Kickstarter.com campaign jamming out, but what some of you may not know is that TBJ has been in the making since the dawn of man.
No one can dispute that man is the greatest foodie in the animal kingdom and being that we have strived for eons to consume pork in the most efficient and tasty fashion. Let me explain. Around 13,000 BC man got tired of chasing the tastiest of beasts, the fierce wild boar, just to get a ham sandwich. Some clever caveman convinced a wild boar to chillax in a cozy sty. While the boar was fierce and tasty he was not too smart and didn't know that sty meant mud pit with a fence around it. His loss our gain...the Pig was born. Man stared at its belly knowing something magical was going to come of it.
For centuries people did all kinds of awesome things with pork: roasted it, fried it, pickled it, made jerky out of, and banned it with religious law because it was just too good to be true, but in the eighth century somewhere in Germany humanity had one of its greatest breakthroughs. Someone, let’s call him Hans Hiedefleischen, tired of not being able to take large portions of pork belly on long pillaging cruises, tried something new. Hans took mans to greatest assets pork and fire and put them close but not close. Knowing slow and low was the way to cook the perfect meat, and because it meant he could tell his wife he was busy doing something when she asked if he wanted to watch “Sex in the City” with her, he tended to his smoking pork for days on end. He called the resulting perfection Bakko. Quickly a marketing guy changed the name to bacon because seriously who would want bakko and eggs it sounds dumb.
Bacon became all the rage. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner people were eating the stuff but in 1924 Oscar Myer rocked the world with another bacon breakthrough. Using the might of the American industrial machine with the desire to get the roaring twenties going, Oscar started selling pre sliced bacon. Some people said, “oh its not thick enough.” Then it was explained to them that that meant they could eat more pieces. BTW why isn't the expression “the best thing since sliced bacon?”
Bacon was now even easier to consume and sliced bacon ruled for almost a century. Even the vegetarians and poultryphiles were making their own off brand versions of bacon… as if. The grand finale was yet to come.
In 2013 a team of 5 foodies joined forces to create the ultimate in portable pork. Using all the tools of science and knowledge of man before us, we combined delicious savory bacon with the sweetness of brown sugar and jammed it into a jar so we could take anywhere, open it, and eat bacon. Instant spreadable bacon enjoyment has finally arrived."

BRAND NEW TOP AMERICAN PRODUCT ALERT!
Outstanding Ingredient: Bacon Spread!
Over the past few years, riding on the wave of America’s insanely popular bacon boom is the rising tide of the popularity of boiled or preserved jams. An unfamiliar newcomer to the surge of bacon related food items in the market, Bacon Jams™ was viewed with initial skepticism but seems to now have taken hold of all things bacon.
As for this bacon jam, that is, a product that is reduced with sugar in the manner of a traditional fruit preserve or jam, it is perfected along with the addition of high-quality bacon blended with Bacon Jams’ own medley of spices. It’s on one hand a bacon tsukudani (a traditional vegetarian Japanese minced or paste like savory preserve made out of seaweeds, such as konbu or wakame, and at times with seafood or meat, reduced in soy sauce and mirin and eaten spread over plain boiled rice, usually for breakfast or lunch), and on the other a literal bacon spread in its own right.
The shelf life of The Bacon Jams’ offering is 30 days and while that is a great benefit, the undeniable proof is in the jam: this product is one of the most hassle-free condiments, with a rich and savory bacon flavor profile -- its versatility and ease-of-use makes this one jammin’ product to have in your kitchen. To illustrate its versatility, bacon, which is commonly topped onto hamburgers, is done in a snap without arduously having to fry each strip one-by-one. Direct from the jar, this wonderful jam can be spread over sandwiches, tossed into a salad with a dollop of mayo, on grilled fish, steak or pork chops, baked potatoes, and used as the “secret sauce” to dress up a humble stew or casserole, among the variety of uses proposed by the highly acclaimed Pennsylvania-based food shop.
Each jar contains 8 oz. (approx. 227 g) of Bacon Jams and is available for purchase in three flavors All Original, Red Chile & Garlic and Black Pepper and can also be used, as an added measure, to give hamburger patties more zing or as a cracker and bread schmear. This product is so amazingly versatile that it can be used to enhance virtually any style of cuisine with its umami savory richness and full-body flavor!

https://tbjgourmet.com/blogs/news/9955705-the-bacon-jams-first-day-out,"The Bacon Jams' First Day Out
Our first big bacon festival was the Virginia Bacon Festival last month. Bruce and I packed the bacon-mobile on a Friday afternoon and set off from Conshohocken not really knowing what to expect or how The Bacon Jams was going to stack up. Laden with hundreds of pounds of sweet delicious Bacon Jam, we drove south. A few stops at Royal Farms (the kids from Baltimore told me their chicken was legit, but I never thought gas station fried chicken could be that good!), every annoying punk album I have that Bruce hates, and one beautiful sunset cruise over the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel... and we made it! With the long drive behind us, we spent the night labeling jars and gaining wisdom from Bruce’s long-time friend and our gracious host, Rorey! You haven't seen the last of me dude!
The next morning was cool, but the sun rising over the back bay and the sighting of a great blue heron was all I needed to know this was going to be a great day. We set up our stand in the shadow of the storied Scope Center in lovely downtown Norfolk and waited for the masses.
They came fast and hard in droves- wave after bacon-crazed wave. Some people might think the best part about my gig as the Executive Chef for The Bacon Jams is cooking hundreds of pounds of bacon a day, tasting seemingly unending amounts of bacon for perfect texture, and going home smelling of savory bacon. They would be right, but a close second is going out into the market to feed people The Bacon Jams. Watching the transition from “Uh Bacon Jams…yeah right, what is that?” to “well, since I am at a bacon festival, I guess I should try it” to “thank you so much for bringing me out of the darkness and into the bacon light!” is truly gratifying. (So is turning the aforementioned massive cooking sessions into actual cash money, but I digress.)
It wasn’t all Bacon Jam tasting and selling. There was a plethora of awesome vendors sampling and selling everything bacon, live music, and a bacon eating contest where The Bacon Jams’ sponsored contestant took second! My family from Philly even showed up to sample the goods!
All-in-all, it was a great event for a great cause. People left with big smiles and bags heavy with The Bacon Jams, and we left with the confidence that people love our product and a firm knowledge that we would be stopping for more Royal Farms chicken on the way back."

The History of Grilled Cheese
Do you ever wonder who invented grilled cheese?
“While similar recipes are mentioned in Ancient Roman texts — and, let's face it, the French have been making their famous croque monsieurs since the early 1900s — today's notion of the grilled cheese is commonly traced back to the 1920s, when Otto Frederick Rohwedder, considered ""the father of sliced bread,"" invented a bread slicer that made distributing white bread easy and affordable.”
So clearly, a grilled cheese sandwich is a wonderful addition to your family meal planning. You can keep things classic, or add your own unique twists.
Sprucing Up Your Grilled Cheese
Some of the finest dining establishments have grilled cheese sandwiches on their menus. Sometimes they are served “open faced”, while usually it is served “closed” with a side of fries.
If you are wandering what to add to a grilled cheese, here are some clever ways to embellish your grilled cheese:
- Add bacon (yumm!)
- Add tomatoes or quick tomato jam (double yumm!)
- Mix different gourmet cheeses for a unique and creamy blend
- Add garlic butter
- Add caramelized onions

- Add fresh fig spread
The options for grilled cheese additions are really endless, as well as many choices for what goes well with grilled cheese.

BBQ chicken is one of the easiest dinner options to make for your family and friends.
This simple grilled dish is summery, kid-friendly, and finger-licking good.
BBQ chicken is cooked inside your grill with the lid closed. This creates the perfect conditions for cooking tender and moist chicken. Inside the grill, the heat circulates around the chicken and cooks the meat slower from all sides.
The History of Barbecued Chicken
The history of barbecue chicken is as rich as the juicy dish itself.
Grilling can be traced back all the way to the 17th century, starting with the Arawak tribe of the Caribbean and South America.
The Arawak people created their own style of cooking over a natural flame, with sticks over fire. They then placed meat on it. This method of cooking was called Barbacoa.
Why Chicken?
Chicken is a perfect protein.
Chicken is lean, so it helps with weight management. Because it is so lean, it reduces your risk of heart disease.
Chicken is rich in amino acid tryptophan, which raises your brain’s levels of serotonin. (That’s your feel good hormone). So, it literally helps to make you happy!
Barbecued chicken is also versatile. There are countless chicken barb recipes and BBQ chicken meal ideas. It is delicious served several different ways. It goes with just about everything, from fries to veggies.
Here are some serving ideas for BBQ chicken:
- Sliced over a crisp salad
- Served on soft brioche with a slice of sharp cheddar
- Sliced and tossed into angel hair pasta
- Placed on top of a heaping pile of mashed potatoes
What goes with BBQ chicken? Well, pretty much everything. Such as:
- Potato salad
- Potato chips
- Pickles
- Seasoned fries
- Fresh fruit salad
Can bbq sauce be used as a marinade?
Yes. You can buy chicken marinade sauce in a bottle, but it’s so easy to make your own marinade. You can create a savory marinade for chicken by adding bacon jam to your sweet baby rays BBQ sauce marinade.
There are many sweet and savory chicken recipes out there, but TBJ Gourmet suggests this delicious BBQ chicken seasoning recipe with a yummy bacon marinade twist.
It delivers a snappy and sweet BBQ chicken to die for:
The Recipe
Ingredients:

- 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts or 8 boneless skinless thighs (about 1 1/2 pounds)
Directions

- Refrigerate for 2 hours or freeze up to 1 month; defrost in the refrigerator overnight before cooking.
- To cook: Remove the chicken from the bag and grill over indirect heat, covered, until cooked through, lightly charred and an instant-read thermometer registers 165 degrees F, 20 to 25 minutes.

https://tbjgourmet.com/blogs/news/barbecued-ribs-with-sweet-tomato-jam,"Barbecued Ribs with Sweet Tomato Jam
Did someone say, RIBS?!
Ribs are Tasty. Ribs are Juicy.
Ribs are the perfect addition to your weekend menu. No matter what the time of year, everyone loves ribs. They are always a welcome addition to any family gathering.
Ribs Are Delicious
The thing that people love most about ribs is their scrumptious taste.
There is simply nothing like the sweetness of perfectly seasoned and glazed ribs. The finger-licking flavor always gives a group a wonderful reason to gather and celebrate.
It's all about that juicy, tender, and sweet barbecued flavor. Ribs really are the perfect hit to impress your family and friends, on any occasion.
What Kind of Ribs To Buy
Before you heat up your oven or grill, you need to make certain you have the perfect cut of meat to start with. There are several different types of ribs.
Types of ribs:
- Baby Backs Ribs- These small ribs pack a punch. They come from the belly area of the pig. They are lean, yet they still have lots of meat between the bones. Their size allows them to cook more quickly than other ribs. You’ll need to buy more of these ribs for a large group because they are small.
- Spare Ribs-These ribs come from the underside of the pig. These ribs contain succulent and porky meat. These taste great with many sauces. When purchasing, make sure that they are pinkish-red in color and have some marbling.
- St Louis Style Ribs-These ribs are uniform in shape, so they are simple to work with. They have less meat on them than baby back ribs, but they are nice and fatty. They are flat and juicy, and cook evenly.
Always ask around for a well respected butcher in your neighborhood, to ensure the best cuts of rib. You want to find the best, cleanest cuts of meat possible. Do some research.
Tip: Many people opt for St. Louis-style ribs. There is a higher amount of fat on them, which makes them more satisfying and flavorful.
Sweet and Savory
Speaking of St Louis-style ribs….
The folks at TBJ Gourmet have come up with a St. Louis-style rib recipe that is so juicy and truly mouth watering. It features their Savory Tomato Jam in a delicious way.

The Recipe
TBJ’s Barbecue Ribs with Tomato Jam
Serves 4
Ingredients:
- 1 pound of sliced bacon, cut into ½-inch pieces
- 1 12-rib rack of St. Louis–style pork spare ribs (about 4 pounds/1.8 kg)
- 1 Cups of TBJ’s Savory Tomato Bacon Jam (the best tomato bacon jam to buy)
- 12 ounces (360 ml) beer
Directions:
- Preheat the oven to 225°F (110°C).
- In a large cast-iron skillet, cook the bacon over medium heat until crispy. Transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain; leave the remaining fat in the pan. (bacon makes everything better!)
- Cut the rack of ribs in half and place the halves, meaty-side down, in the skillet. Cover with foil and bake in the oven for 3 hours, or until very tender and cooked through.
- For glaze topping: Place the rendered bacon pieces and savory tomato bacon jam in a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped and smooth.
- Transfer the glaze topping mixture to a saucepan and add the beer. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer until reduced to a jammy consistency, about 45 minutes. Let cool.
- When the ribs are cooked, uncover the pan and pour off any fat and juice (save this delicious cooking liquid for other uses if you like).
- Flip the juicy ribs over so they’re meaty side up. Evenly spread the savory bacon jam over the top of the ribs and bake, uncovered, for 1 hour.
- Remove your low and slow ribs from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes.
- Preheat the broiler. Broil the ribs until the top is bubbling and golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes.
- Let your slow cooked ribs rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
Final Sweet Thoughts
While the taste of your ribs is the most important thing about your meal, presentation is important, too!
Have fun with this!
Try playing up the barbecue theme with red and white checkered tablecloths. This works both inside and outside, in summer or any season.
You can serve your ribs in many ways:
- Place your amazing ribs in cute country style baskets over seasoned fries
- Serve your ribs stacked up on individual wooden boards - with tiny bowls of sides/salads
- Show off your ribs on a simple white plate, letting the ribs shine - with a side of cornbread.
Any way you serve it, you are certain to have a great meal or barbecue party.

Make a Bacon Jam BLT
Make your bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich even more bacony by spreading toasted bread with bacon jam before adding the three main ingredients.
Bacon Jam Roasted Vegetables
Coat Brussels sprouts, carrots, sweet potatoes, broccoli, or any other vegetables you like to roast with bacon jam and a sprinkling of salt. Roast in the oven, taking care to cook at a medium temperature so the bacon jam won’t scorch.

For many people, ham is the dish of choice for Easter.
Whether it is for Easter Dinner or for Easter Brunch, an amazing glazed ham is always a crowd pleaser.
And did someone say, leftovers?!
Historical Ham
For Easter, ham dishes are often center stage. Especially glazed ham dishes.
The reason that homemade ham dishes became such a popular meat of choice for Easter is simple: it was readily available and affordable for the common man.
History explains this.
Fall season was historically when the village pigs were slaughtered. The pigs were cured during the winter time. Once Spring and Easter season finally had arrived, the delicious hams were fully cured and ready to be consumed.
Because Lent’s required fasting was over in the Spring, the timing was perfect for a grand feast to begin.
In addition to this, there are other logical reasons. In the 1940s, synthetic fabrics became a popular choice. The need for wool (and sheep) then declined in the USA.
Pigs increased in popularity at this time. This is another factor in why a delicious ham (instead of lamb) became a regular for our American Easter menus.
Easter Ham Menu
If you are wondering what to make for Easter Sunday Brunch, a glazed ham dish is delicious - served cold or fresh out of the oven.
Serve sliced ham roast with side items, like: green salads, potato dishes, Spring green beans, lemon carrots and more. Deviled Easter eggs and fruits can be added to round out your brunch theme party or celebration.
There are many delicious Easter ham brunch recipes to choose from. TBJ Gourmet offers this simple twist on a recipe from Taste of Home, by adding a simple 3 ingredient ham glaze that will turn your ham into a true masterpiece:
Easter Ham with Bacon Jam Glaze Recipe
Ingredients
- 1 fully cooked bone-in ham (8-10 pounds)
For the Glaze for Easter ham:
Directions
- Preheat the oven to 325° temperature.
- Place ham in a shallow roasting pan.
- Score the surface of the ham, making diamond shapes 1/2 in. deep.
- Cover and bake for 1 3/4 hours.
- In a small bowl, combine the 3 glaze ingredients.
- Spoon over ham.
- Bake, uncovered, until a thermometer reads 140°, for 15-30 minutes longer.
- Let stand for 10-15 minutes before slicing.
Serve your gorgeous ham on a silver tray (or tray of your choice) surrounded by your chosen veggies, like potatoes and carrots/green beans. Spoon any extra glaze on the top of the ham.
BTW, ham is also healthy: If you are wondering what to prepare for easter brunch that is also healthy, ham is a great choice. Four ounces of ham is only 214 calories and provides 34 grams of protein.
Ham can be stored safely in your fridge in air-tight containers for 3-4 days.
Sweet and Succulent
There is nothing quite as wonderful as spending your Easter brunch with your family.
A scrumptious bacon jam glazed ham with delicious side dishes provides warmth and conversation to help build your holiday memories.
After your brunch, make the most of those mouth-watering ham leftovers:
- Try adding ham pieces to your favorite breakfast casserole dishes. Ham makes a delicious addition to a quiche!
- Ham sandwiches with a smear of bacon jam are always a hit (try classic or sweet chili!)
- Ham pieces stirred into a hearty potato soup, served with fresh crusty bread, is a delicious day-after Easter meal.

TBJ Gourmet and the Philadelphia Eagles have a delicious history together... our company was born at an Eagles Tailgate!
When Bruce Kramer, co-founder of TBJ Gourmet, accepted a challenge to have a cook-off with a fellow die-hard birds fan the scene was set for a tasty tangle. Each tailgater prepared their version of Jalapeño Poppers, a popular game time snack.
Bruce decided to create goat cheese stuffed poppers topped with Bacon Jam, a relatively new condiment to the rest of the football faithfuls. As you can imagine, these poppers won the cook-off and more importantly the hearts of the Philly Fans that managed to get their hands on one of those Bacon Jam Poppers.
""You need to make more of that and sell it!"" someone shouted in excitement. And as the rest of the tailgate party quickly agreed, the beginnings of TBJ Gourmet were born!

Southern dishes really are the best, aren't they?
Fried green tomatoes are a classic! They are created by slicing up unripe green tomatoes, battering them, frying them, and then dipping them.
They really are a must for tomato lovers - any season! Paired them with a delicious fried green tomatoes sauce like the TBJ Gourmet deep south tomato jam dip - it’s divine!
Fried Green Tomatoes Are A Hit!
Have you ever seen the classic film Fried Green Tomatoes starring actress Jessica Tandy? I bet you wondered if people in the South really do eat fried tomatoes!
Well, they do! A fried green tomato meal is delicious - and you can bake your own fried green tomatoes - also a fantastic appetizer - for your family or guests!
Start out by purchasing some big green tomatoes at your local organic food store or farmers market. It’s also a great way to make use of any leftover tomatoes you may have laying around.
What are the best tomatoes for fried green tomatoes?
The trick is that your tomatoes need to be unripe tomatoes (green!). This means that they are firmer than red tomatoes, and not as juicy. Green tomatoes are so delicious - tangier, milder, and they are perfect for frying!
This savory appetizer will soon be your favorite thing to serve at parties or gatherings. It’s a sure hit - a classic and home-y dish. It’s also SO simple! The green tomatoes are dredged in flour and then skillet-fried to crispy perfection. Then, dipped in southern tomato jam!
Storing Your Fried Green Tomatoes
Fried green tomatoes are delicious when they are hot off the presses and perfectly crispy!
However, it is possible to successfully store them in your fridge for a couple of days for a sweet treat later on. The trick is to make sure that you place them in a nice, cool, airtight container.
To reheat your fried tomatoes, simply pop them back onto the skillet, or warm them up in the oven. You can even reheat them in your air fryer if you have one.
Tips For Perfect Fried Green Tomatoes
Fried green tomatoes should be nice and crunchy on the outside, and sweet and juicy inside.
Some tips and tricks for making Fried Green Tomatoes:
- Pick the perfect tomatoes.
- Your flour coating should be nice and thin for crispy tomatoes.
- Don't crowd your pan by frying too many at once. Make your tomatoes in smaller batches.
- Have a large plate ready that is covered with paper towels for a dry place to cool your tomatoes. This will keep them from becoming soggy.
- Serve with a side of fried green tomatoes dip - TBJ gourmet deep south tomato Jam is perfect.
- Create a fried green tomato napoleon by layering your tomatoes and dip.
To create a fried green tomatoes meal, try topping your healthy fried green tomatoes with different things.
Try adding: a spoonful of crab meat or tuna salad on top, or try creating a BLT with your fried green tomatoes, by placing them inside a soft roll with tomato jam, crispy bacon slices, and your favorite cheese!
How To Make Perfect Fried Green Tomatoes
There are several variations on fried tomato recipes. You can use white cornmeal (a fav in the South), or basic cornmeal.
Buttermilk adds more flavor than traditional milk - but feel free to use milk or half n half if that’s what you have on hand.
All-purpose flour is best to keep things light and super crispy!
Fried Green Tomatoes with Tomato Jam Dip Recipe
Ingredients:
- 4-5 medium-sized green tomatoes
- Sea salt
- 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 tablespoons of Cajun seasoning
- 1 cup of buttermilk
- 2 large egg
- 1/2 cup of white cornmeal
- 3/4 cups of finely grated bread crumbs
- 1/4 cup canola oil for frying
- 1 cup of TBJ Gourmet “Deep South Tomato Jam” (the best sauce for fried green tomatoes!)
Directions:
- Slice your green tomatoes into 1/2 inch slices.
- Sprinkle slices with sea salt.
- For your fried green tomatoes batter: In 3 medium bowls, mix together: 1) the flour with the cajun seasoning; 2) the buttermilk with the eggs-whisked; 3) the fine breadcrumbs with the cornmeal.
- Bread your green tomato slices by dipping in 1, then 2 and 3.
- On medium heat, place oil in your skillet.
- Place the dipped green tomato slices onto the pan.

He simply named the pizza “Hawaiian” because that was the name on the can of pineapple that he used. Can you believe it?
Since 1962, this popular pizza has been a favorite at pizza restaurants and pizza chains all over the world - especially the USA and Canada.

A Hot Brown Sandwich from Kentucky is the ultimate Southern Comfort dish!
It’s a delicious, mouth-watering, open-faced turkey sandwich that is topped with slices of juicy tomatoes and tomato Jam, bubbly cheese sauce and crispy bacon.
Incredible, right?
This scrumptious dish can be served as either a full meal or as an appetizer. The dish is the perfect marriage of turkey, bread, tomatoes and melted Mornay cheese sauce!
And this hot brown recipe is to die for!
What Is A Hot Brown Sandwich?
A Hot Brown Sandwich is quintessentially Southern. It’s the perfect sandwich any time of year, served to your own family or to your guests.
Southern cooks have embraced this recipe for turkey sandwiches since the 20s! The dish is said to have been born at the Brown Hotel in Louisville.
Kentucky legend has it that chef Fred K. Schmidt, who was at the Brown Hotel in the 1920s, was the man who created it. He served the hot brown sandwich to guests after a fun evening of dancing. It’s been a hit ever since.
This “drinking food” has been a favorite in Kentucky and all over the South for generations, and for good reason - it really is tasty - a turkey sandwich that tops all others.
Part of what makes this dish so tasty is the fact that it is served open-faced. Bacon is added on the top, and who doesn’t love bacon?
To top that awesomeness off, the brown sandwich is broiled and bubbling over with delicious, French Mornay sauce - a cheesy delicacy.
French Mornay Sauce
Are you wondering what Mornay sauce is?
Mornay sauce is a delicious cheese sauce, thanks to the French! French styles of cooking were introduced decades ago in the South, and the Mornay sauce is pure French heaven.
Mornay sauce is a really creamy and smooth cheese sauce. It begins with a mixture of melted butter, milk, white flour, and egg yolk. It is cooked until it becomes smooth. As it thickens, grated cheese is whisked in. Usually the French use a hard white cheese for Mornay sauce (like Gruyère and Parmesan). Some Americans use Cheddar.
Mornay sauce for the hot brown is easy to make - and oh so good!
Here is an easy hot brown recipe for you:
Hot Brown Sandwich Recipe With Tomato Jam
For our hot turkey and cheese sandwiches, we created a delicious
twist by adding TBJ Deep South Tomato Jam for a tasty twist!
Ingredients:
- 8 slices of toast - remove the crusts
- 3 tablespoons of butter
- 2 cups of whole milk
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1/2 cup grated Gruyère cheese
- 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- Extra shredded cheeses for the top
- 1 pound deli turkey, sliced thinly
- ½ cup of Deep South Tomato Jam
- 1 large tomato, sliced thinly
- 8 strips of crispy bacon
Directions:
- Melt your butter in a saucepan on medium-low heat.
- Stir in the flour until smooth.
- Slowly add in the whole milk, the salt, Worcestershire sauce, and finally, the cheeses.
- Cook until it thickens and becomes bubbly.
- Cut your toast diagonally and remove crusts. Place your trimmed toast on a baking sheet.
- Build the sandwiches by first spreading the tomato jam directly onto the toast. Then, pile up the turkey slices onto the toasts.
- Cover evenly with your Mornay cheese sauce.
- Top it with tomato slices, two slices of bacon on each sandwich in an “X”, and some extra shredded cheese.
- Place your cookie sheet in the broiler until the sandwiches are nice and hot, and lightly browned.
Serve and enjoy!
Important: Do not use glass dishes or bakeware! Broiling can cause glass to explode. *Even if it says it is oven-safe.
Tips For Making The Perfect Kentucky Hot Brown Sandwiches
While this recipe is pretty straight forward, TBJ Gourmet has a few tips for you!
Tips so that you sandwiches are perfect, every time:

Bacon jam is the trending condiment right now. Its popularity is skyrocketing. It can be found in countless recipes and on menus everywhere from fast food burger joints to five-star gourmet restaurants.
It’s not hard to understand why bacon jam is such a hit. This delectable spread combines smokey, savory, and sweet flavors with everyone’s perennial favorite - crispy, mouth-watering bacon.
If you haven’t tried bacon jam, you definitely should. A wide variety of bacon jam flavors is available for purchase, and it’s an amazingly versatile condiment. You can use it at breakfast, lunch, or dinner, for appetizers or snacks, and even in desserts.
When you do make the right choice and decide to try bacon jam for yourself, make sure you store it properly. As with any food product, improper storage can lead to serious health risks.
Why Bacon Jam Should Never Be Stored at Room Temperature
The last thing you want to do after you’ve opened a new jar of bacon jam to make a delicious recipe is to pop the top back on and leave it on the counter. Bacon jam should never be stored at room temperature.
When stored at room temperature, bacon jam, like many other foods, can become a breeding ground for Clostridium botulinum, a spore-forming bacteria and nerve toxin that can cause botulism in humans. Botulism attacks the nervous system and can cause paralysis, breathing problems, and even death.
To avoid this illness, never, under any circumstances, store your bacon jam at room temperature. Instead, you should refrigerate or freeze it.
How Long Can Bacon Jam Be Refrigerated?
Bacon jam can be safely refrigerated for two to four weeks. Any amount that you keep in the fridge will need to be used within that length of time.
You can store bacon jam in any refrigerator-safe container. Many bacon jam enthusiasts choose to use mason jars for aesthetic reasons. You can certainly go that route if you wish, but don’t feel locked into it. Even simple tupperware will suffice to keep your bacon jam safe in the refrigerator.
If you know you won’t use all of your bacon jam before the allotted two to four weeks have passed, your best bet is to freeze it instead.
How Long Can Bacon Jam Be Frozen?
Bacon jam freezes and thaws quite well, so if you know you aren’t going to use it in the next few weeks, try freezing it instead. Bacon jam can be safely kept in the freezer for up to six months. You can use any freezer-safe container to store your bacon jam.
To thaw the bacon jam, place it in the fridge. It will need to thaw for around 24 hours, depending on the amount you are thawing. You cannot refreeze bacon jam once it has been thawed.
Here’s a helpful tip: when you freeze your bacon jam, separate it out into servings. Estimate the amount you will need at a time and only place that much in each container. That way, when you thaw it out, none of it will go to waste.
Discover the Sweet & Savory Goodness of Bacon Jam
If you store your bacon jam correctly, it will last you for many, many meals, snacks, and appetizers. From breakfast to lunch to dinner to dessert, there’s no dish that can’t be enhanced with TBJ Gourmet bacon jam. Try it for yourself today!"
https://tbjgourmet.com/blogs/news/how-to-make-bacon-jam-for-burgers,"How to Make Bacon Jam for Burgers
Bacon jam is a hot commodity right now. There’s a reason this tasty condiment is trending: its savory flavor pairs well with so many dishes, making it a versatile and delicious addition to any meal or snack spread.
The ways to use bacon jam are practically endless. You can use it in appetizers, side dishes, breakfast spreads, soups, fresh-baked breads, dips, and even desserts. You can use bacon jam to up the ante on a pan of mac and cheese or add a little fire to a BLT.
However, one of the best ways to enjoy this versatile relish is on a big, juicy burger.
When paired with a grilled or pan-seared hamburger, a toasted brioche bun, and the melted cheese of your choice, bacon jam reaches what many claim to be the zenith of its mouth-watering potential.
While you can find a tantalizing collection of bacon jams and rubs at TBJ Gourmet, including unique flavors like Sweet Chili or Honey Habanero, you also might want to try your hand at creating your own bacon jam at home.
If you’re the type who likes to make your own condiments from scratch, here is a walkthrough for how to make bacon jam for burgers yourself.
Serves: 12
Ingredients
- 1.5 pounds bacon, chopped
- 2 teaspoons butter
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 4 onions, diced
- ¼ cup sherry vinegar
- 1.5 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- ½ cup water
- 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
- 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
Method
- Cover a baking sheet with tin foil. Place the bacon on the sheet in a single layer and bake it in the oven at 400°. Bake for 30 minutes or until crisp. The crispier the bacon, the better it will work in bacon jam.
- Remove the bacon from the oven and place each strip on a plate lined with paper towels to drain the fat. Keep the bacon grease on the baking sheet.
- Chop the bacon into small bits.
- Place a pot over medium heat and add two teaspoons of bacon fat and butter. Saute the onions with one tablespoon of salt for 10 minutes.
- Stir the brown sugar, thyme leaves, black pepper, sherry vinegar, and cayenne into the sauteed onions.
- Add the chopped bacon.
- Stir the water into the pot and simmer for 15 minutes.
- Remove the pot from the burner and stir in the olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
- Stir continuously until the jam reaches the desired consistency.
Tips
For mouth-watering bacon jam burgers, pan-sear the hamburger patties until a slight crust forms on both sides. You won’t need to add too much seasoning - salt and pepper should do the trick. The crust will be delicious with the bacon jam.
Consider lightly toasting the hamburger buns. Ciabatta, brioche, onion, potato, and pretzel buns each add a different texture and flavor, so experiment until you find the right fit for your taste.
The same goes for cheese. Bacon jam pairs well with basically any kind of cheese. Try cheddar, brie, goat cheese, smoked gouda, provolone, or pepper jack.

https://tbjgourmet.com/blogs/news/how-to-use-finishing-salt,"How to Use Finishing Salt
It happens to every cook at some point. You picked out the perfect recipe. You loaded up a grocery cart with the best ingredients. You went to the kitchen and put together what should be a fantastic meal.
However, when you taste the final product, something is missing. What could it be? Chances are, what you need is a good finishing salt
At TBJ Gourmet, we provide the highest quality, tastiest bacon jam available, but that’s not all we have. We offer a wide selection of delicious condiments made from the highest-quality ingredients. We are guaranteed to maximize your efforts in the kitchen and please every taste bud around your dinner table.
Among the products we offer are several varieties of finishing salts. Once you’ve tried them, you won’t believe you ever cooked without them. To learn a little more about finishing salts and how to use them, read on.
What Are Finishing Salts?
We are all familiar with salt. It’s an essential food staple, an ingredient that practically every recipe calls for and every kitchen has on hand. However, finishing salts are different from the table salt most recipes call for. It’s more of a gourmet salt.
As the name implies, finishing salts are meant to be used as the final touch on your dish. They add a last bit of flavor that takes your food from just fine to “everyone wants seconds.”
The suitable finishing salt can complement the flavors of your dish, bringing them out without overpowering them. It can add a little kick of heat or a wisp of smoke to that dish you planned so carefully and worked so hard to create.
What Kind of Finishing Salt Do You Need?
There is no one-size-fits-all type of finishing salt. It is crucial to choose the one that best fits the dish you are preparing, accentuating its flavors and adding a hint of just the right element to make it perfect.
For instance, a dash of our Smoked Bacon Salt is perfect for seasoning steaks, fish, or greens. It’s a pink Himalayan salt with a touch of pepper and a mouth-watering infusion of bacon.
Then there’s our Smoked Bacon Maple Sugar Rub for dishes that need a hint of sweetness to perfect them. This finishing salt features antioxidants and nutrients you won’t find in regular sugar, making it a healthy yet delicious rub for glazing meats and vegetables. It’s also made with real Canadian maple sugar! Try it on yams. You won’t be disappointed.
If your culinary creation needs a spicy kick to round it out, our Himalayan Ghost Salt will do the trick nicely. A dash of ghost pepper is just enough to add a little lift without going overboard, making it an excellent touch for roasted meats and grilled vegetables.
The Final Touches
Using finishing salts is easy, but you don’t want to go overboard. Use them sparingly. Sprinkle a little bit over the surface, and you’ll be surprised how perfect the effect will be on your taste buds.
The same idea applies to our bacon jam: sometimes, you just need that little something extra to give your food the taste it needs to be perfect. Let us know if we can help you at all in choosing the right kinds of bacon jam or other additives for your dishes!"

Bacon Jam is quickly becoming one of America's favorite condiments. Chances are you have even seen bacon jam on a restaurant menu paired with burgers, cheese plates, as a dip for pretzels or many other apps! This week we sat down with Chef Andrew Guille from The Manoa Tavern located in Havertown, PA about how he uses our bacon jam in the kitchen!
1. How do you use our bacon jam in your kitchen?
We use the black peppercorn bacon jam on our House Burger and currently on our Grilled Flatbread Special.
2. What do you like about using our jam in the restaurant setting?
I love the accessibility and consistency best about it. Always saves us prep time. Bacon Jam is a time consuming labor.
3. Have you had any positive response from people about bacon jam on the menu?
We recently did a rosemary red bliss potato flatbread with the Bacon Jam and it blew people’s mind; the sweet and salty with the rosemary potatoes worked wonders. People always love a twist on classics.
4. What's your favorite food to pair with our bacon jam on your own time?
I love to push the envelope on what you can to with Bacon Jam. Usually Deviled Eggs and Grilled cheese are in order, but I literally keep finding new and innovative ways to use your product."
https://tbjgourmet.com/blogs/news/korean-barbecue-at-home,"Korean Barbecue At Home
So, you’re having friends and family for a special gathering and need a unique idea of what to serve?
Korean BBQ is super popular right now, and it just might be your answer.
It’s healthy, easy, fun….and sure to please even the most picky guests!
What is Korean Barbecue?
Korean barbecue refers to the hugely popular Korean method of grilling meats.
What does Korean BBQ taste like? Heaven.
Korean barbecue is not any ordinary meal - it is truly a unique experience. Instead of just serving your guests a meal, the cooking and eating are the center stage attraction.
Your family or guests will gather around a special grill that is placed in the center of your table. You will bring out several small plates of different raw meats.
Korean barbecue sides called banchan (pronounced: bon-chon) are also brought out to your table, alongside cooked rice.
How does Korean BBQ work? - As a group, you each gather around and do your own cooking and eating.
It’s simple - and delicious!
Korean BBQ History
While Korean barbecue is super trendy now, this style of cooking has been around for a long time.
The origins can be traced way back to the Maek, a nomadic group from central Asia. What made these people unique was that they traveled with seasoned meats in a new, unique way.
They were always wandering, so they needed to bring food with them that they could later cook on an open fire when they stopped.
Side dishes that were popular with Budhists - like kimchi and bibimbap - accompanied the meats. (banchan)
When these two dishes were served together - banchan and the grilled meats - Korean BBQ was born, and it quickly became a Korean staple.
Nowadays, “K-food” is all the rage in starry Hollywood restaurants, and in homes - everywhere.
Korean BBQ At Home Grill
It’s quite easy to make Korean BBQ at home. You just need the right Korean BBQ equipment and ingredients.
Are you wondering how to eat Korean bbq? First of all, for proper etiquette and safety, you’ll need metal chopsticks. Not wood. You can use these to place pieces of bonchan and meat onto your rice.
You’ll also need the star of the show: The BBQ grill.
“Electric Korean BBQ grills are the easiest to use. They give a moderate heat level and don't get as hot as the other types. The main point that leaves other options behind is, these grills are smokeless. So you can prefer to use it indoors than other grills.”
Next, you’ll need a fabulous recipe for sauces to serve with your meats and sides.
Korean BBQ Sauce Recipe with Bacon Jam
What does Korean BBQ sauce taste like? It’s sweet and also spicy.
You can make this sauce ahead of time so that you can spend more time with your guests.
Here is the best Korean BBQ seasoning recipe:
Ingredients:
- 1 cup low sodium soy sauce
- 1 cup Asian pear peeled, cored, & chopped (about 1)
- 1/2 cup TBJ Sweet Chili Gourmet Bacon Jam
- 1 Tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 Tablespoon garlic minced
- 2 teaspoons ginger paste (or fresh minced peeled ginger)
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 green onion chopped
Directions:
- Place all the ingredients for the glaze in a blender and process until smooth.
- Pour sauce into a small saucepan over medium-high heat.
- Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, then reduce to simmer.
- Simmer for about 5 minutes.
- Cool and set aside.
For the best meat types for your Korean BBQ, use tender cuts of: brisket, whole chickens, pork butts, pork ribs, and big steaks like sirloin and rib-eye. Really, any meat can work.
Time To Serve
Now that your special sauce is ready, you can place your BBQ grill center stage. For a simple DIY Korean BBQ table, add a festive cloth to your table.
Each guest should have their own plate and sauce dish, and metal chopsticks.
Place your raw meats on pretty side dishes around the grill. Add your side dishes around this, with rice and wraps. (lettuce wraps and flour wraps work well)
Once set, everyone can start cooking, dipping, and eating this tasty Korean BBQ together.
Bon Appétit!"

Pulled Pork Sliders are always a mouth-watering favorite at a family gathering.
Add in some TBJ Gourmet Bacon Jam, and you're in for a sweet and savory twist that will give your taste buds a thrill.
Why Pulled Pork?
Pulled pork is a simple dish to make that is both delicious and affordable.
Pork itself is easy to come by. Pigs for pork are cheap and simple to raise. They do not require much land, and they grow quickly. They are an excellent protein source.
You can cook large portions of pulled pork at one time, with plenty of leftover goodness for several meals afterwards.
It is a great dish to make for crowds - both sweet and savory, and delicious when served with many different sides.
Where Did Pulled Pork Come From?
Have you ever wondered where pulled pork came from?
Pulled pork most likely was brought to the American South by Spanish explorers. These Spanish explorers introduced the States to Barbacoa.
The dictionary describes Barbecoa as: “beef, lamb, or other meat that has been slowly cooked with seasonings, typically shredded as a filling in tacos, burritos, etc.”
Native Southern Americans tried to copy this Spanish style of cooking, and it quickly became a popular Southern institution.
What Cut of Pork is Best?
Pulled Pork sliders are created with the meat from the shoulder of the pig. There are two popular cuts of pork for slow cooking:
- Boston Butt: This cut is tender and soft. It shreds very well for making the best pulled pork sliders.
- Picnic Roast: This cut is also great for long cooking. It is often sliced or cut up into pieces.
For the purposes of juicy sliders, we suggest that you get a nice Boston Butt shoulder cut for ease of shredding.
As always, be sure to purchase your meat from a trusted butcher near you.
The Recipe
Here is a fantastic slow-cooked pulled pork recipe for you to try, that we adjusted slightly from a wonderful recipe from The Magical Slow Cooker. It will quickly become one of your favorite bacon jam appetizer recipes:

Bacon jam is taking the world by storm. This delicious, crispy, smoky, savory condiment has blasted into the public consciousness for all the right reasons. Burger chains advertise this topping on their menus. Gourmet chefs concoct elaborate dishes with bacon jam as the centerpiece. Popular brunch spots feature this ingredient in their omelets.
But bacon jam isn’t just for fancy dishes and breakfast. It’s a highly versatile condiment. One excellent way to employ this tasty topping is to liven up your boring lunch.
There are many sandwiches that will benefit from a dollop of bacon jam between bread slices. Whether you opt for the traditional flavor of Classic Uncured Bacon Jam, the sweet heat of Honey Habanero Bacon Jam, or the sophisticated kick of Sweet Chili Bacon Jam, your taste buds will thank you for adding this topping to your lunch sack.
Below are a few of the best sandwiches that pair well with bacon jam.
Hamburgers
Perhaps the most obvious choice, burgers and bacon have been a failsafe combination for years. Add a little bacon jam to your beef to give it a new lease on life. It pairs exceptionally well with cheddar cheese on top.
BLTs
Take a whole new approach to the bacon, lettuce, tomato combo. Spread some bacon jam on toasted wheat bread and then add fresh, crispy lettuce. You can give it a mouth-watering Southern twist by replacing ripe red tomato slices with fried green tomatoes.
Grilled Cheese
Once you try a grilled cheese with bacon jam, you’ll think the sandwich was invented as a vehicle for this spread. Try it on sourdough with a combination of cheeses - cheddar, gouda, and pepper jack make an excellent trio.
Turkey
The snooziest of lunch meats can transform into something exciting with a bit of bacon jam spread on top. Add Swiss cheese, Dijon mustard, fresh lettuce, and a few avocado slices to really perk up your lunch break. It’s especially good on potato bread.
Ham
Double the pig, double the flavor. Add a spoonful of bacon jam to your ham sandwich, throw on some Havarti cheese and a few pickles. This one is especially delectable on toasted rye bread with a dash of honey mustard.
Subs
Just about any sub sandwich can benefit from a generous helping of bacon jam. You can add some fresh veggies - cucumbers work nicely with most sub meats. The crunch and smokiness of the bacon jam will transform this old staple into a new favorite.
Barbecue Pork
Barbecue sandwiches can achieve a whole new level of scrumptiousness with some bacon jam in the mix. The flavor of bacon jam mixes nicely with any smoky barbecue sauce, and it adds just the right amount of crispy crunch to the sandwich.
Peanut Butter
Forget the PB&J you loved as a kid. Ditch the grape jelly and use bacon jam for a grownup twist on this perennial childhood favorite. It pairs fantastically with smooth peanut butter. You can try it on plain white bread or a tasty artisan bun for a more sophisticated touch.

Ingredients
3 large chicken breasts
3 large eggs beaten
1 1/2 cups Panko breadcrumbs
1 cup of honey
3 tablespoons hoisin sauce optional
2/3 cup soy sauce
8 - 10 cloves garlic minced
3 tablespoons fresh ginger grated - about 2 inch nubbie
4 cups water
4 cups instant jasmine rice
6 scallions scallions chopped
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
1 - 2 tablespoons sriracha more or less to taste
Instructions
- Preheating your oven to 400 degrees.
- Rinse your chicken breasts under cold water and then pat them dry. Cut them into bite sized pieces and set aside.
- Add eggs to a medium sized bowl and beat. Place panko breadcrumbs in a separate bowl.
- Coat your chicken pieces in the egg mixture and then the breadcrumbs, making sure that all sides are covered and coated.
- Move the coated chicken pieces to a baking sheet either sprayed with non-stick spray, covered in parchment paper or lined with a cooking rack. Bake for 15-20 minutes.
- While the chicken is baking: In a large sized saucepan, add honey, chili bacon jam, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, garlic, ginger and sriracha. Bring to a gentle boil over medium high heat. Stir often. Reduce temperature and simmer.
- Add your sesame seeds to a small saucepan, stirring continuously. Be careful not to burn them. Keem stirring them until they toasted. Remove from the pan and move to a small bowl.
- Next, make your rice for your sticky rice bowl: Add water to a large pot and bring to a boil. Stir in the instant rice, cover and remove from the heat. Let sit for 5 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork.
- Chop up your scallions.
- When your chicken is fully cooked, remove them from the oven and toss them in the sticky sauce. Coat the chicken pieces completely in the sticky sauce.
- To create a bowl: Spoon rice into the bottom of each bowl, top with the sticky chicken and garnish with scallions and toasted sesame seeds.
- Enjoy!

You can adjust this recipe easily to be a chicken broccoli rice bowl. Toss in broccoli or your favorite cooked veggies for extra vitamins if you’d like. Some other veggie suggestions include: cooked corn pieces, green beans, sliced thin carrots, and more.
Another idea: make this an asian chicken noodle bowl by cooking your favorite noodles alongside the chicken instead of rice. Stir some extra sauce into your noodles for added sweetness. Equally delicious!
Toss in some peanuts for an added crunch!
It’s also nice when served alongside cold dishes, like: cucumber salads, sliced watermelon salad, crisp baby greens, and more.
To save the leftovers, simply place the sticky chicken in a sealed container, and the rice in a separate sealed container. Microwave a portion in a microwave safe bowl, and you have an instant fast meal! It’s even incredible when served cold. Enjoy every last bite!

https://tbjgourmet.com/blogs/news/the-best-way-to-store-bacon-jam,"The Best Way to Store Bacon Jam
Bacon jam is a trending condiment and with good reason. This delicious, savory concoction adds a perennial favorite — bacon — to countless recipes and snacks. Whether you’re making bacon burger sliders, bacon jalapeno poppers, or a tantalizing bacon party dip, bacon jam is a must-have for the ‘20s.
Bacon jam is hot right now, and not just when you use it to make spicy bacon wings. But once you’ve stocked up on this increasingly popular ingredient, how do you store it?
As with any meat product, it is vital to know how to store bacon jam properly to avoid food poisoning and other unpleasant — and sometimes life-threatening — ailments. No one knows bacon jam better than TJ Gourmet. That’s why we’ve put together this handy guide for how to store bacon jam.
Trust us, you won’t want to let this one-of-a-kind condiment go to waste!
Do not store bacon jam at room temperature
One thing you definitely don’t want to do with bacon jam is to store it at room temperature. Bacon jam stored at room temperature can carry Clostridium botulinum, which causes botulism, a severe form of food poisoning that can result in hospitalization, nerve damage, and even death.
Don’t worry, though. There are several easy ways you can store and preserve bacon jam so you can have it handy for your next dinner party or barbecue.
Refrigerating bacon jam
One easy way to store bacon jam is to refrigerate it. Simply place the bacon jam in any appropriate container and pop it in the fridge. The refrigeration process will not affect the flavor or texture of the bacon jam, so whenever you want to use it, you can just grab it and add it to your next culinary masterpiece.
How long can you refrigerate bacon jam?
Bacon jam is safe to refrigerate for two to four weeks after it has been opened. The refrigeration process will keep those nasty bacteria at bay for this period. If you need to store your bacon jam for longer than four weeks, however, you may want to consider another storage option: freezing.
Freezing bacon jam with freezer jars
One excellent way to store bacon jam is in freezer jars. Make sure to use jars specifically designed to be used for freezer storage. Regular jars may break when the jam expands slightly during the freezing process. Spoon the bacon jam into the freezer jars, leaving a little room at the top for that expansion.
It’s a good idea to freeze small amounts of the bacon jam separately. Try to divide it up into serving sizes you are likely to use at one time. That way, you can thaw just enough for a single recipe without having to store any of the jam afterwards.
Just like with refrigeration, freezing bacon jam should have no effect on its flavor or texture.
Freezing bacon jam with freezer bags
Another option for storing bacon jam is to use freezer bags. Again, try to spoon the amount of bacon jam that you are likely to use at a time into each bag. Make sure to remove as much air from the bag as possible before you seal it and place it in the freezer.
How long can you freeze bacon jam?
Bacon jam can be frozen for up to six months."

When we unveiled the first draft of our Classic Bacon Jam at a Philadelphia Eagles tailgate 6 years ago, we had no idea the obstacles that we would face putting spreadable bacon into a jar and selling it to the public.
Every year we learn more and more on the in's and out's of the food business including manufacturing and production of our products, how to distribute our jam to bacon lovers around the country and meeting USDA certifications for putting meat into a jar.
One of our biggest challenges from inception to present day has been articulating what bacon jam is and how it should be used in the kitchen. We have a list of our favorite uses as well as an abundance of delicious recipes on our website but when you see our jam on the shelf at a grocery store we are not there to walk you through using our product.
To combat this communication issue we now include a ""necker"" on each of our jars of Bacon Jam. These necker's include some of our go-to recipes as well as details on where to find more recipes and information on our jams!
Attaching a necker to our jars allows us to communicate with the customer directly, and more importantly we are able to immediately show how to use this unique condiment on multiple meals.
Through the years we have found that we are successful in selling our Bacon Jam when we eliminate confusion and provide clear messaging. Our products are unlike ketchup or mustard to the consumer, we have to first explain what Bacon Jam is because it is a relatively new product to the market.
Using these necker's is one of the many ways we are trying to supply the answers to potential customer's questions."

If you haven’t tried TBJ Gourmet bacon jam yet, you are really missing out. Not only is bacon jam an increasingly popular, utterly delectable condiment, it is versatile enough to make an appearance at any meal, snack, dinner party, barbecue - basically, anywhere food might be found.
Bacon jam combines all of the best flavors: smokey, savory, sweet, a little spicy. With a variety of flavor available, you can find the right bacon jam for any meal.
Here are a few great ways to enjoy eating bacon jam.
Breakfast
Bacon is always an obvious - and excellent - choice at breakfast. Adding bacon jam to some of your morning favorites will upgrade your breakfast table and start your day off the right way.
Try bacon jam sliders made with sausage, cheese, eggs, and slider buns. Or how about mouth-watering brunch flatbread made with croissant dough, eggs, goat cheese, fresh basil, and, of course, honey habanero bacon jam?
Lunch
You can also use bacon jam to add some pizzazz to your midday meal. Bacon jam is a superb way to dress up a sandwich, like with our recipe for jammin’ barbecue pork. If you’re looking for something lighter, there’s also this spa special with green apple and cheddar or this turkey avocado sandwich with bacon jam.
Prefer a salad for lunch? Try a BLT salad or a bacon jam caprese salad.
Dinner
Bacon jam can be used in countless ways for a tantalizing dinner, either with an entree or a side dish. Center your meal around this black pepper baked salmon or these seared bacon jam scallops.
If you’re in the mood for pasta, a nice Americana bacon jamtini or savory fettuccine bacon jam fredo should be right up your alley.
If you want something to warm you up on a cold night, give Donna’s bacon corn chowder a try. Another warming and filling option is Swedish meatballs with bacon jam sauce.
As far as sides go, the sky's the limit with bacon jam. Loaded baked potatoes with bacon jam make a perfect sidekick for any steak. Amish-style bacon potato salad is an inspired addition to any meal. Or you can get creative with some potato pancakes with bacon jam-infused sour cream.
Snacks and Appetizers
Bacon jam is by no means limited to your three square meals a day. It shines even brighter when it is paired with snacks, appetizers, and party food.
Your guests won’t have a chance at resisting loaded bacon fries or Jalapeno poppers. These brats in a blanket take a traditional appetizer to a whole new level. Spicy bacon wings and thrice-baked pigskins will score at any football party.
Desserts
Bacon may not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of dessert. If not, then think again. Bacon jam adds a whole new dimension to some of your favorite sweets.
Take these apple bacon jam turnovers, for instance. Never have savory and sweet made such a heavenly match.
You can also try bacon jam S’mores (no, really!). The sweetness of marshmallows and chocolate are enhanced by the savory crunch of bacon jam.
Explore the Many Uses of Bacon Jam
Whether you’re looking for a scrumptious breakfast, a delightful sandwich, a tantalizing entree, a crowd-pleasing hors d'oeuvre, or a succulent dessert, TBJ Gourmet has got you covered. Our bacon jam makes even the tastiest dish that much tastier.
Order a jar now to see for yourself; once you’ve tried it, you’ll never want to cook without it."
https://tbjgourmet.com/blogs/news/three-course-meal-tip-1-elevate-the-appetizer,"Three Course Meal Tip #1: Elevate the Appetizer
I do not care if you are a seasoned chef calmly watching the dining room fill up way too fast or you are a first time dinner party host, sweating bullets as the clock ticks ever closer to the moment when the doorbell rings, you win the evening with your first course. If you screw it up you will be the first one eliminated from Chopped! The first bite has the opportunity to be talked about for the entire meal. This is the plate that sets the tone. Think about it, your guests have not even finished their first drinks. You have the opportunity to break the ice by bringing them together with the shared experience of an amazing bite.The appetizer is your announcement that this evening is going to be going to be special.
I am not going to tell you what to make for your guests, but I will suggest some tips on how to choose what you are going to feature for this all-important bite.
- Always KISS. The age old kitchen adage “Keep It Simple Stupid” is paramount here. A simple dish is not mundane or uninspired, it is easy to assemble using ingredients you prepped in advance and ready to use items that you trust. This does not mean that the starter has to be cold, but that you should be able to put it together with minimal effort and little cook time. Remember your guests are coming and you still have two more course and three more bottles of wine to go.
- You can splurge. Even if you are concerned with cost, the upside of the appetizer plate is that it is small so you do not need large portions. If cost is of no concern you can splurge even more! This goes for the additional elements on the plate. When you pick something special to be in the center of a dish do not squander it with sub par accoutrements.
- People eat with their eyes. More than any other dish the plating is critical on the starter. It is the first dish your guests see and while they may be hungry, they will want to savor the fact that nothing at the table is spoiled yet. Your plating should be clean and stylish regardless of the company you keep. If you paid attention to the first tip you already have your sauce and garnish set up to easily apply. So even if you are a rockstar doing a quick seared diver scallop appetizer your cook and plating time can be less than 5 minutes. Pre sauce your plates, drop protein on each one, finish them with glaze and garnish. Send it out the door, pour yourself another glass of wine, and take pleasure in knowing that your guests are about to be wide eyed smiling.
- Good PR is priceless. Tell your guests what is happening to their eyes, mouths and souls as they take in your first dish. I am not comfortable with bragging so this one was always tough for me, until I realized that I was not telling a story about me, but about the food. Tell them the story of why you chose the dish, where you got the ingredients, and how easy it was to prepare. No one will believe the later, but it will add to your mythical status as the Deliverer of Delightful Bites.
Remember when you create food for people you are taking responsibility for a memory. Make it count every time.

https://tbjgourmet.com/blogs/news/uncured-vs-cured-bacon,"Uncured vs. Cured Bacon
TBJ Gourmet is transitioning its line of Bacon Jams to a line of Uncured Bacon Jams!
We once again find ourselves at the confluence of two trends, traditional flavors and natural organic. Uncured Bacon appeals to both the bacon purist and the health conscience lover. To the purist, Uncured Bacon represents the perfect form of bacon, smoked pork belly with no corners cut. To the health conscience bacon lover, Uncured Bacon offers a departure from the nitrates and nitrates that are injected into most bacon's today.
I’m not going to slam bacon injected with nitrate and nitrate cure and I am not going to stop eating them. They are delicious! What I will do is tell you why I think Uncured is awesome. Basically when making Uncured Bacon you need to brine and smoke the pork belly longer to turn it into bacon. This typically gives it a saltier and smokier taste than cured bacon.
How does this affect you, the bacon jam lover? It won’t change things a whole lot. You will notice a bit more smokiness and you will be able to find it in more stores, you know the ones that like the natural stuff. And do not worry this is not going to affect the price!

https://tbjgourmet.com/blogs/news/upcycled-food-association,"Upcycled Food Association
We had the pleasure of speaking with Turner Wyatt, CEO of Upcycled Food Association, about all things Upcycling and how TBJ Gourmet plays a role in curbing food waste as well as giving back to those in need!
1. What are the main goals of this organization?
The Upcycled Food Association is a nonprofit dedicated to reducing food waste by growing the upcycled food economy. We envision a food system where all food reaches its highest and best use. Through consumer education, research, marketing strategy, and policy advocacy, we seek to build a more interconnected and effective upcycled food industry, and raise awareness about upcycled foods among consumers.
2. What are TBJ Gourmet and Michael Oraschewsky's role in the Upcycled Food Association?
When I was transitioning out of my last job as Executive Director of Denver Food Rescue, I knew I wanted to explore consumer driven solutions to food waste. I started reaching out to upcycled food entrepreneurs to learn more about the industry, and Mike Oraschewsky was one of the first people I spoke with. Over the months through my conversations with various companies we started noticing a pattern that all upcycled food businesses were facing basically the same obstacles: regulatory challenges, messaging barriers, lack of infrastructure, etc. TBJ Gourmet and eight other businesses made the decision to come together to co-found the Upcycled Food Association. Since our formation in October 2019, we have already grown to about 50 Members! Mike serves as a Board Treasurer, and we're lucky to have him.
3. Where do you see upcycled products in the future marketplace and how has the response been thus far from the public about the importance of supporting upcycled products?
Most consumers want to buy more upcycled food; about 60% in fact. This is staggeringly high considering there has been virtually no widespread marketing strategy for upcycled food. I think this high demand is caused by how much regular people tend to care about food waste: about 95% of people want to reduce food waste in their own lives. Upcycled food puts the power to protect the environment in the hands of these people. And it really is a huge benefit to the environment. According to Project Drawdown, reducing food waste is the third most effective solution to climate change out of all. Ahead of things like regenerative agriculture, even ahead of solar energy!
4. What is the key message you want to deliver to the consumer about upcycling and why they should be looking for these products when they shop?
Luckily, we don't have to convince people that upcycled food is good, nor that reducing food waste is important. There's an inherent human quality that makes us want to not waste food, and our Members' products speak for themselves: they're delicious! But I'm not just making this up: people really do naturally care about this stuff. In 2017 our friends at Drexel University found that people have a greater positive association with regard to benefit to the environment with the word 'upcycled' than the word 'organic.'
5. How does a company like TBJ Gourmet upcycle their products?
TBJ Gourmet has identified a gap in our food system, where bacon ends and pieces are discarded simply because they don't meet some arbitrary cosmetic standard. That's essentially what this movement is about: recognizing the true value in food that was there all along. Upcycling food is about fully utilizing our resources, and that's something everyone agrees is important."
https://tbjgourmet.com/blogs/news/we-took-our-bacon-jam-to-capitol-hill,"Executive boar, Bruce Kramer, took a trip down to our nation's capital to take part in the 10,000 Small Businesses Sumit sponsored by Goldman Sachs. He along with 2,200 other small businesses met district & state Congress members to speak about small business rights and programs directly affecting business like TBJ Gourmet. Bruce took part in the Small Business Summit with speakers including Warren Buffet, Richard Branson, Tyler Perry, Sara Blakely, and Lloyd Blankfein and even caught some air time on ""Morning Joe"" on MSNBC? (Bruce is seen at the 3:10 mark)
Here's what Bruce had to say about his experience:
Tell us about the summit?
Over 2200 alumni of the 10,000 small business program from all 50 states met in Washington DC for the first ever small business summit. The roster of speakers included Warren Buffett, Mike Bloomberg, Richard Branson, Sara Blakey, Tyler Perry, and various Congressman & Governors. Everyone of them had a story about how they built their business that was inspiring and illustrative. It was nice to understand we are not the only small business that faces challenges as we grow.
What has your experience been like in 10,000 Small Businesses?
Going through the 10KSB program opened my eyes to to new ways of thinking about our business problems and core focus. I am better equipped to manage the growth and development of our business and take advantage of opportunities as they are presented.
What was it like to speak to state representatives about small business issues/rights?
Generally we see our elected officials on TV interviews and the news and that is all, but anyone can go visit them in Washington. When they say call or write your Congressman, I saw the people reading the mail and answering the phones. If you want something reach out to your Congressman.
What positives can you take away from your trip to Capitol Hill?
I like many people feel a level of despair when thinking about how dysfunctional Washington is these days. When I met and spoke to individual Senators and Representatives they are sensible, intelligent, and even charming. It is easy to understand how most people think their Congressman is good and all the others are the problem. Hopefully we will start having some agreement and Washington will move forward out of the current gridlock.
What did Michael Bloomberg think about our Bacon Jam?
Mike liked the Black Peppercorn Jam best and thought it would make a nice addition to the Bloomberg cafeteria."
https://tbjgourmet.com/blogs/news/what-is-cured-versus-uncured-bacon-jam,"What is Cured Versus Uncured Bacon Jam?
Bacon jam is a hot commodity right now. This delicious condiment combines sweet, savory, and smoky flavors with the crispness of well-cooked bacon to delight all taste buds.
Bacon jam is popping up everywhere: in recipes found in well-known magazines, newspapers, and blogs; on menus everywhere from the local fast food joint to high-end gourmet restaurants; and at neighborhood brunches, dinner parties, and barbecues.
Do a little digging, and you’ll discover that, among the wide variety of bacon jams you can purchase or make at home, there are two major types available: cured and uncured.
So what is cured versus uncured bacon jam?
What Does it Mean for Bacon to Be Cured?
When we say that bacon is cured, what does that mean? Cured bacon is bacon that has been treated with a preservative mixture, usually consisting of salt and sodium nitrates. Nitrates are responsible for the distinctive pink hue of bacon slabs.
This curing treatment is designed to preserve bacon, keep it from smelling odd, and prevent it from developing spores that can cause botulism and other types of food poisoning.
There are two curing practices that are generally used on bacon: dry curing and wet curing.
Dry Curing
During the dry curing process, bacon is thoroughly rubbed with a mixture of salt, nitrates, seasonings, and often sugar. The mixture is left on the bacon for roughly a week. After this time has elapsed, the bacon is rinsed off. Usually, it is then smoked.
The term “dry curing” applies here because only dry ingredients are used in the process. There is no need for “wet” or liquid ingredients.
Wet Curing
Wet curing is a much faster process than dry curing, so it has become the prominent process for most of the largest bacon brands. This means that most bacon on today’s market is wet cured.
The same curing ingredients common in dry curing - salt, nitrates, seasonings, and sugar - are mixed into a brine. The bacon is then either soaked in this brine or injected with it, a method referred to as “pumping.”
As in dry curing, the bacon is usually smoked after the curing process.
What Does it Mean for Bacon to Be Uncured?
In the strictest sense, no bacon is truly “uncured,” in that all bacon must undergo a preservative process of some sort. Otherwise, it would never make it to the market without going bad.
Still, there is a demonstrable difference between cured and uncured bacon. While cured bacon has been treated with synthetically derived ingredients, particularly nitrates, uncured bacon is treated only with the natural nitrates found in vegetables like celery and beets.
Not only is the “uncured” curing method healthier, it results in more flavorful bacon.
Buy Uncured Bacon Jam from TBJ Gourmet
While all bacon is technically “cured” in the sense that it is treated to extend its longevity and make it safe to eat, there is still a significant difference between cured and uncured bacon.
While both processes result in bacon that is safe from food poisoning and other threats, at TBJ Gourmet we believe uncured bacon is preferable because it is healthier and tastes better. Try it for yourself! We’re confident you’ll taste the difference."
https://tbjgourmet.com/blogs/news/what-s-in-bacon-jam,"What’s in Bacon Jam?
Bacon jam is taking the world by storm. This smoky, savory condiment pops up everywhere from gourmet items in five-star restaurants to fast food burger menus, neighborhood dinner parties to grand gala openings, the breakfast table, and the backyard cookout.
Because bacon jam is such a tasty and versatile treat, its uses, pairings, and incarnations are practically limitless. It can add a mouth-watering twist to breakfast omelets, burgers, sandwiches, hors d'oeuvre trays, entrees, and even desserts.
With bacon jam becoming ever more popular, a common question arises: what’s in bacon jam? What secret ingredients make this sweet and savory relish so tantalizing?
The list is more straightforward than you might expect.
Bacon Jam Ingredients
You can choose from a variety of bacon jam flavors, or even make it yourself, so the ingredient list may vary depending on which type you purchase or create. With that in mind, here are the essential ingredients of bacon jam:
- Bacon
- Onions
- Shallots
- Garlic cloves
- Brown sugar
- Maple syrup
- Apple cider vinegar
If you prefer bacon jam that is less sweet, you can reduce or remove the maple syrup. You can also reduce the amount of brown sugar, although removing it entirely is not recommended.
For extra heat, finely chopped peppers can be added. Jalapenos, habaneros, or chilis will add flavor and some kick to the jam. Make sure to remove any seeds unless you want four-alarm-spicy bacon jam.
How Bacon Jam Is Made
Again, no two recipes will be the same because such a wide variety of bacon jams exists. Still, the basic formula for creating bacon jam is relatively simple.
First, the bacon is cooked until crispy. Crispy bacon is an absolute must for bacon jam - that crunch is essential in every bite.
The onions and shallots are then caramelized, usually in the fat from the fried bacon.
Once the onions and shallots have properly caramelized, the crispy bacon, chili powder, apple cider vinegar, maple syrup, brown sugar, and garlic are mixed in and simmered. This mixture simmers until it reaches a thick, jam-like consistency.
The bacon jam must then cool completely before it can be transferred to a jar.
Bacon Jam Recipes
The beauty of bacon jam is that it can be paired with so many items and used in so many recipes:
- For scrumptious appetizers, try bacon jam in jalapeno poppers, spicy bacon wings, a bacon ranch cheese ball, or bacon jam brie bites.
- For an upgraded breakfast, you can make bacon jam breakfast sliders, a brunch flatbread, or raspberry bacon American toast.
- You can even use bacon jam in soup! Donna’s bacon corn chowder is the perfect way to stay warm on a chilly evening.
- And don’t forget dessert. For a special treat, try an apple bacon jam turnover or bacon ham S’mores.
Try Bacon Jam for Yourself
With its simple ingredients, delicious balance of savory, smoky, and sweet flavors, and unique crispy/jammy texture, bacon jam is an excellent addition to any menu. Don’t take our word for it, though. Try TBJ Gourmet bacon jam for yourself. Whether you get creative with one of the delicious recipes above or just eat it straight from the jar, your taste buds will rejoice.

You haven’t had a real breakfast treat until you’ve cut open a hot, flakey, buttery biscuit and spooned some maple bacon jam into it. Crispy bacon and sweet maple syrup mixed with a little melted butter make a delicious, fluffy biscuit irresistible.
Waffles
Instead of pouring plain old syrup over your waffles, top them with a few spoonfuls of maple bacon jam. The mixture of savory and sweet will elevate your breakfast experience to new heights. Maple bacon jam goes perfectly with pancakes and french toast, as well.
BLT
Maple bacon jam isn’t just for breakfast. Pair it with a few crisp leaves of lettuce and a juicy, ripe red tomato for an unforgettable BLT sandwich. Make sure to toast your bread. For a Southern twist, replace the red tomatoes with fried green tomatoes - your taste buds will thank you.
Burgers
What burger isn’t improved with bacon? Add maple bacon jam to your next cookout for an unexpected, delicious twist. Spread a spoonful of bacon jam on top of your burger patty, then add the fixings. Don’t forget the cheese - maple bacon jam is especially tantalizing when paired with cheddar.
Cheeseboard
Speaking of cheese, nothing will dress up your next dinner party like the addition of maple bacon jam to your cheeseboard. If you want to assemble an hors d'oeuvre platter to die for, include brie, creamy blue cheese, kalamata olives, candied walnuts, and pickled green beans, and, of course, a generous serving of maple bacon jam. Your guests will keep coming back for more.

https://tbjgourmet.com/blogs/news/what-to-serve-with-bacon-jam,"What to Serve with Bacon Jam
If you’re looking for an easy way to elevate any meal, bacon jam is the perfect addition to your pantry. This sweet and savory bacon jam can add an exceptional, tangy flavor to a huge range of foods.
Here are some ideas of what to serve with bacon jam to upgrade any traditional meal or snack.
Bacon Jam Burger
With the flavors of bacon, onions, brown sugar, balsamic vinegar, and more, bacon jam is the perfect topping for a delicious and flavorful burger.
Bacon jam pairs well with any burger and your favorite burger toppings, making it an easy way to upgrade your favorite burger and make a traditional meal feel gourmet.
Bacon Brie Bites
Like other kinds of jam, bacon jam pairs perfectly with brie cheese for any delicious snack. Just add brie and jam to a phyllo cup and bake for an easy and tasty snack or party appetizer. Or, for an even easier option for a party appetizer, you can use brie, bacon jam, and a variety of other meats, cheeses, and crackers for a charcuterie board for you and any guests to enjoy.
Classic bacon jam is always a great go-to for this snack, but there are plenty of flavored bacon jams you can try with this recipe as well, including a sweet chili bacon jam that goes great with brie and other cheeses.
Bacon Jam Breakfast Sandwich
You can’t go wrong with the classic combination of bacon and eggs for breakfast. For a more exciting twist on this traditional sandwich, you can replace bacon with bacon jam and pile the sandwich high with any style of egg and your favorite cheese, veggies, and sauces.
For other options for the most important meal of the day, you can lean into the sweet and tangy flavors of the jam and pair it with waffles or pancakes and a drizzle of maple syrup for a sweet and savory breakfast.
Bacon Grilled Cheese
Bacon and grilled cheese is another classic pairing that you can make even better with the inclusion of bacon jam. The toasted bread and combination of gooey cheese and bacon jam will make your grilled cheese even better, and the tanginess and maple flavor of the jam will add even more flavor than just frying your sandwich with bacon.
Just add a layer of bacon jam to your bread before toasting, and you’ll have the perfect melty grilled cheese with a winning flavor combination.
Bacon Jam Roasted Vegetables or Potatoes
Coating vegetables with bacon jam is an easy way to add some flavor to roasted veggies. It pairs well with a huge range of vegetables, so you can toss carrots, cauliflower, green beans, brussels sprouts, or more with this jam and some seasoning for an upgrade to conventional roasted vegetable side dishes.
For other side dish ideas, you can add bacon jam to roasted, fried, or mashed potatoes. Or, for an appetizer that everyone will love, you can use bacon jam in potato skins and pair it with other classic toppings.
Bacon Jam Toast
You don’t even have to do any extravagant cooking or baking to enjoy bacon jam. You can just toast any kind of bread and spread on some bacon jam as you would with any flavor jam.
It’s simple, easy, and tastes delicious, so you can enjoy it with any meal or as a quick snack.

How a CPG company can harness the power of Wefunder
to focus on sustainability and upcycling
By Jennifer K Murray
Balancing Results and Ethical Commerce
For a consumer packaging goods (CPG) brand, finding ways to be sustainable is a balancing act. While they may want to do their part to slow global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, they also must find ways to balance financial results and ethical commerce.
Finding this balance is often tricky. Reducing energy and water use, reducing food waste, and shifting to renewable resources are just a few ways to be more sustainable. However, CPGs also need to be financially smart.
The Investment Platform Wefunder
Wefunder was founded in 2012. This online investment platform serves the purpose of being one of the ways that a CPG can find the financial resources needed to make sustainability financially possible.
They help give the green light to CPG sustainable projects by opening up the opportunity to thousands of investors, who can finance pieces of a startup or a CPG project with ease.
“It is predicated upon the idea that anyone, regardless of wealth, should be able to invest in a company,” says VENTURE BEAT, the leading source for transformative tech news.
TBJ Gourmet Plans their Sustainability Project on Wefunder
Smart CPGs like TBJ Gourmet, known for their popular bacon jam spreads and other products, have plans to harness this power. TBJ Gourmet is proud to be a highly respected company that is building a sustainable facility in Central PA. Their Wefunder is part of bringing this plan to fruition.
TBJ’s new project will be a zero waste facility. For example, they will convert excess bacon lard into new food products or biodiesel for our delivery trucks.
TBJ also intends to use the equipment in their new facility to upcycle bacon ends. These ends can then be used to dry spent grain from breweries and distilleries into millable flour. Another upcycling plan is extracting both collagen and calcium from egg shells.
The TBJ Gourmet Wefunder gives investors the opportunity to be a part of this plan. TBJ Gourmet is an award winning company of “best in class” products, including their much-loved bacon spread products. They are also a national distributor in food service, and a leader in the upcycling food revolution.
Sustainability matters to TBJ Gourmet. Their margins are above industry standards, with $6M in total revenue, and they have been fortunate to be profitable since inception.
A Powerful Purpose
Wefunder gives CPGs the power to make impactful choices with how they do business. An investor can feel assured that their investment in a CPG, like the upcycling leader TBJ Gourmet, is going to a high growth company where gourmet taste is key.
The benefits of waste reduction will leave a lasting impact on Central PA, with innovation that excites. Jobs will be created and the neighboring land will be respected.
TBJ Gourmet serves over 5,000 restaurants nationwide, with products on 7,500 grocery shelves. They are the leader in bacon jams. Wefunder investors will empower this forward-thinking company, and other CPGs like them, by giving them the financially wise opportunity to leave a footprint that respects our earth."

When we first saw this recipe for Piggy Buns, we were confused. We didn’t know if we we should eat them, or give them a cuddle. We still don’t know! Perhaps both is a good idea! Give ‘em a little kiss and a little cuddle before devouring them. But seriously, have you ever seen anything more cute and more delicious looking at the same time?? (read more)"

At RightThisMinute, we tend see a lot of odd commercials for bizarre products. We'd include ""The Bacon Jams"" in this category, only it's not a bizarre product at all. Who wouldn't want bacon on everything? While it's definitely not kosher, the spreadable bacon is likely following in the footsteps of mayo, mustard and relish. Oh, and hey fellas, if the commercial proves to be true, hot chicks love to get porked... (read more)"

Ok, you have permission to cheat here and just buy the pre-made crescent roll dough… We won't tell if you don’t.
Roll Ingredients
- ¼ oz active yeast
- ½ cup sugar
- ⅓ cup shortening
- ¼ cup butter
- ¾ cup water at room temperature
- 4 cups flour
- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp salt
Stuffing Ingredients
- 6 oz The Bacon Jams All Original Spreadable Bacon
- 4 oz soft cream cheese
Preparation
Stir yeast into water until fully dissolved. Mix in shortening, sugar, salt, eggs, and half of the flour. Beat in a mixing bowl until dough is consistent throughout and has no clumps. Stir the other half of the flour into the mix. Knead the dough into a ball , cover, and set aside on the counter for about an hour or until the dough has doubled in size.
Place the cream cheese in a mixing bowl and fold in The Bacon Jams All Original Spreadable Bacon. Cover and refrigerate.
Preheat Oven to 375. After the dough has risen flatten it with your fist. Separate the dough into two parts. Roll each piece into a circle then spread half of the butter onto them. Using a knife cut the each circle into 10 pieces or wedges. ( If you used the store bought rolls [ not judging ] just lay out the pieces.) Place 1 oz of The Bacon Jams cream cheese and bacon stuffing near the shortest side of each wedge. Do not place stuffing further than a ⅓ of the way down the wedge. Roll the the dough up stuffing side toward the point at the end. Curl each piece into a crescent shape without breaking the dough. Set them aside to rise for 45 minutes or until them have doubled in size again. Gently butter the tops of the pieces. Place the pieces point side up on a lightly oiled baking sheet and set in the oven for 15 -20 minutes.
Note: If you used pre made dough follow the baking instructions on the package."
https://tbjgourmet.com/blogs/recipes/11190473-bacon-jam-gorgonzola-flatbread,"Bacon Jam Gorgonzola Flatbread
This is one of the first recipes I made with The Bacon Jams. I have seen it recreated with a few different variations and all of them have been delicious.
Ingredients
- 1 12"" flatbread crust or dough rolled out to the same size
- 8 oz The Bacon Jams Red Chile & Garlic Spreadable Bacon
- 1 cup crumbled Gorgonzola cheese
- 2 cups fresh arugula
- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, divided
Preparation
Oil a baking sheet and preheat your oven to 350 degrees for raw dough (for prepared crust follow package instruction). Spread The Bacon Jams Red Chile & Garlic Spreadable Bacon evenly across your dough or crust. Sprinkle the crumbled Gorgonzola evenly over the pie. Place the pie on the baking sheet and set in the oven. Lightly wilt the arugula in a pan with the remaining oil. After 20 minutes, or when your crust is golden and crispy, remove the baking sheet from the oven and add the arugula. Cut on a cutting board and serve hot or cold."

https://tbjgourmet.com/blogs/recipes/12772405-swedish-meat-balls-with-bacon-jam-sauce,"Swedish Meat Balls with Bacon Jam Sauce
I have been a fan of the traditional condiment of swedish meatballs, Lingonberry sauce, since I went to Ikea one day to get some shelves for my first apartment, but we have to recognize that Lingonberry sauce lacks bacon.
Ingredients
- 1/2 lb. ground beef
- 1/2 lb. ground pork
- 4 oz The Bacon Jams Black Pepper & Honey Spreadable Bacon
- 3 tbsp. Butter
- 3 tbsp. finely chopped onions
- 1 tbsp. finely chopped garlic
- 1 tbsp. fresh parsley crushed
- ½ tsp. cardaman
- ½ tsp nutmeg
- 1/3 c. bread crumbs
- 1/4 c. water
- 1/4 c. heavy cream
- 1 egg
- 1 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1/2 tsp. pepper
- ¼ c sour cream
- 1 tbsp flour
- 1 ¼ cup beef stock
Preparation
Saute your onions with the butter until they caramelize. In a mixing bowl, combine the water, cream, and bread crumbs. Fold in the meats, egg, herbs, and salt. Hand crush until smooth and fine. Roll the meat into balls in your palms. Brown the meatballs on all side in the pan.
After removing the last of the meatball from the pan add the flour to the remaining grease in the pan. Keep the pan on medium heat and stir it in until you have a nice roux. Add the stock, while turning up the heat to bring the sauce to a simmer. Constantly scraping the bottom of the pan for goodness. At this point decide to stir in the Bacon Jam bacon spread or to reserve it as a condiment ( the Swedes go either way here). Lower heat and and the sour cream. Stir it all together and add your balls to the gravy. Serve with flat egg noodle and garnish with parsley."

Now, we don’t go in for all this changing the names of food items just, because their countries of origin have ticked us off (i.e. freedom fries, General Grants chicken with broccoli, etc.), but when we add bacon to something -- it becomes ‘Merkin!
Ingredients
Preparation
Beat the eggs, milk, and 2 tbsp of sugar together. Soak your slices of Challah until they are saturated in the egg mix. Melt enough butter to thinly coat the bottom of a pan. Once the butter has starting to brown, lay your slices in, cooking each side until they are golden brown, but flipping only once. Cover the finished toasts to keep warm once you've removed them from the pan. Throw in the remaining butter, turn up the heat, then deglaze with the vodka. Add ¾ of the raspberries and 2 tbsp of sugar. Before the raspberries start to break down, add the bacon jam. Continue to stir until the mixture is thick and warm. Spread the raspberry bacon jam stuffing evenly onto two of the slices of toast and spread your whipped cream cheese on the bottoms of the other two slices. Make two sandwiches, top each with a dollop of whipped cream and the remaining sauce and raspberries, and voila! Raspberry bacon American toast the French will wish they could claim!
Ingredients

While they sizzle, mix the sour cream and bacon jam. Spread a thin layer of the sauce onto each pancake. When the apple pieces are tender, take them off the heat. Lay a slice on each pancake, then spread more sauce on them. Repeat this step until you have several layers of apple and sauce on each potato pancake. Dig in."

We are including this recipe not to tell you how to make a S’more, but to make you feel OK about not having the thought of adding The Bacon Jams to your S’mores earlier. Come on, you didn’t get here on your own, did you?

- 1 Large Marshmallow

- 0.5 oz of dark chocolate
- 0.5 oz The Bacon Jams All Original

Toast your 'mallow until golden brown. You can do this over a traditional campfire, gas stove, or in a broiler, but just don’t light it on fire like a rookie. Apply the All Original bacon jam to the piece of graham cracker that will make the bottom of your dessert sandwich and the chocolate on top of the other half. Place your toasted marshmallow on top of the bacon jam with the “lid” chocolate side down. Smoosh down and enjoy… then lament the fact that you only made one. Now go back and make more."

- 6 oz The Bacon Jams All Original Spreadable Bacon
- 2 sheets frozen puff pastry
- 1 diced baking apple
- 2-3 tablespoons cider vinegar
- 2 egg yolk
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
Preparation
Set the puff pastry out to thaw. Saute the apples in a lightly greased pan with a pinch of salt until they start to caramelize, but are still from in the center.

Lay the puff pastry out on a work surface lightly coated with flour. Roll out any bumps. Cut 4 squares into each piece of pastry.
Dollop 2 tbsp of filling into the center of each piece. Brush the outer edge of each square with the whisked yolks before folding into triangles. Pinch the seams gently.

Bacon jam is the must-have culinary item of the moment. This crispy, savory condiment adds the ever-popular flavor of bacon to any dish it adorns. It comes in a variety of tantalizing flavors and can upgrade any recipe from meh to mouth-watering.
Bacon jam is impressively versatile, making a splash in every dining forum: breakfast, lunch, dinner, party platters, snack foods, even desserts. It has made its debut in dining establishments, from mom-and-pop barbecue joints to five-star gourmet bistros.
Adding bacon jam to any recipe can raise your culinary efforts to a whole new level. It’s especially adept at making already-popular dishes even more drool-worthy.
If you’re looking for a way to make your ribs even more appealing, aromatic, and delicious, give this bacon jam-crusted ribs recipe a try.
Ingredients
- 9 ounces TBJ Gourmet Classic Uncured Bacon Jam
- 4 pounds (12-rib rack) pork spare ribs
- 3 tablespoons barbecue seasoning
- One bottle of beer (non-hoppy)
- 2 sliced oranges
- Salt and pepper to taste
Directions
Preheat the oven to 225 degrees.
Cut the rack of ribs in half.
Rub barbecue seasoning, salt, and pepper into each of the ribs thoroughly.
Place each half in a roasting pan, meaty side facing down.
Place a few orange slices on each rib.
Pour the bottle of non-hoppy beer over the ribs.
Cover the roasting pan with a lid or tin foil.
Bake for three hours.
Remove ribs from the oven when they are cooked through and very tender.
Pour off any fat and juice collected in the roasting pan.
Allow the ribs to cool.
Flip the ribs over so the meaty side is facing up.
Spoon TBJ Gourmet Classic Uncured Bacon Jam on top of the ribs, spreading it evenly over all of the meat.
Bake the ribs for another hour at 225 degrees, uncovered.
Remove the ribs from the oven and allow them to cool for ten minutes.
Preheat the broiler.
Place the ribs in the broiler and allow them to broil for one to two minutes. The top of the ribs should turn a golden brown shade and begin to bubble.
Remove the ribs from the broiler. Allow them to cool for five to ten minutes.
Slice and serve.
Serving Tips
- When seasoning the ribs, use a very sharp knife to cut diamond scores on the back of the ribs, then vigorously rub in the seasoning.
- Salt and pepper the ribs before you rub in the barbecue seasoning.
- Save the juices from the roasting pan to use in other recipes. They’re especially good cooked into greens (mustard or collard), green beans, and other stewed vegetables.
- Serve baked potatoes with the ribs, and add a dollop of bacon jam on top of each potato for extra flavor.
- If you like your meat with an extra kick of spice, try Sweet Chili Bacon Jam or Honey Habanero Bacon Jam.
These Bacon Jam-Crusted Ribs are sure to be a hit at your next barbecue or family cookout. While cooking them requires a considerable amount of time, the result is well worth the wait."
https://tbjgourmet.com/blogs/recipes/bacon-jam-mac-and-cheese-recipe,"Bacon Jam Mac and Cheese Recipe
Bacon jam is the trendiest condiment on the market right now. It appears everywhere, from the local burger joint to five-star restaurants to the most popular items at neighborhood barbecues. This versatile jam turns tired old recipes into mouth-watering sensations with its crispy, savory smokiness.
Bacon jam is a welcome addition to countless dishes for all occasions - breakfast, lunch, dinner, party hors d'oeuvres, sleepover snacks. Pairing it with tried-and-true family favorites is always a winning combination.
That’s why you’ll want to give this Bacon Jam Mac and Cheese a try. Bacon jam makes a delectable addition to this perennial favorite that kids and adults alike will love.
Ingredients
- 6 ounces TBJ Gourmet Classic Uncured Bacon Jam
- 3 cups milk
- ¼ cup butter
- 2.5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 8 ounces elbow macaroni noodles, uncooked
- 2 cups cheese of your choice, shredded (suggested: sharp cheddar, colby-jack, gouda, mozzarella; add cream cheese for extra smooth texture)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Pinch of smoked paprika
Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Place macaroni noodles in boiling, lightly salted water. Allow to boil for 2 minutes less than the package calls for. Reducing the time on boil will keep the macaroni from becoming mushy when baked.
Over medium heat, melt the butter in a medium saucepan. Stir in the flour a bit at a time to create a roux. Stirring constantly, slowly add the milk.
Once the roux thickens, stir in the cheeses. Allow to cook until the cheese is melted into the roux, stirring regularly.
When the cheese has melted thoroughly, stir in the bacon jam.
Place the cooked macaroni in a casserole dish. Pour the cheese/bacon jam sauce over the pasta and stir thoroughly.
Add a layer of shredded cheese over the top.
Sprinkle the smoked paprika lightly over the surface.
Bake for thirty minutes.
Process Tips
- Make sure the pasta is slightly undercooked when you remove it from boiling.
- Use room temperature milk if possible. Warmer liquids thicken faster than cold ones.
- Be creative with the cheeses you use, and include at least three different kinds. Pair classics like cheddar and Colby jack with unusual choices like Brie, Gruyere, and Swiss.
- A little American cheese will help the other kinds melt together more effectively. Mozzarella serves the same purpose.
- You can also add flavored cream cheeses, like sour cream and onion, for an extra pop of taste.
- Don’t use pre-shredded cheeses. They may be more convenient, but they include coatings designed to keep them from clumping. Unfortunately, those coatings also keep them from melting correctly.
This macaroni and cheese recipe is sure to be a hit for any venue. Serve it for family dinners, at parties or barbecues, or as a covered dish for a potluck.
The flavor of bacon jam pairs incredibly well with just about any form of cheese. Adding it to a creamy, flavorful sauce for your macaroni dish is a sure-fire way to please any palate.

Below is a recipe for a bacon-jam topped steak that is certain to make your dining table your favorite spot on the planet.
Ingredients
- 3 tablespoons Classic Bacon Jam (for extra bite, feel free to substitute Sweet Chili Bacon Jam or Honey Habanero Bacon Jam)
- 12-ounce sirloin steaks (you can substitute the steak cut of your choice)
- 1 tablespoon garlic salt
- 1 lemon
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 shallot
- ½ ounce of butter
- 1 tablespoon of water
- Salt and pepper to taste
Directions
Chop up the shallot into small pieces.
Cut open the lemon and squeeze some juice onto both sides of the steaks.
Sprinkle garlic salt on both sides of the steaks.
Salt and pepper both sides of the steak to taste.
Pour the olive oil into a medium non-stick pan and place it on medium heat.
Once the olive oil is hot, put the shallot pieces into the pan.
Once the shallots start to sizzle, drop the steaks into the pan.
Allow the steaks to cook for between four and six minutes on each side. Make sure the steaks reach a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees.
Remove the steaks from the pan and place them on a plate.
Place the pan back on medium heat and add the butter to the pan.
When the butter has melted, spoon in the Classic Uncured Bacon Jam.
Add a tablespoon of water and stir.
Bring the mixture to a simmer, then remove from heat.
Spoon the bacon jam mixture over the steaks and serve.
Cooking Tips
- Make sure that the internal temperature of the steaks reaches a minimum of 145 degrees. The FDA recommends this temperature to ensure the safety of the meat.

https://tbjgourmet.com/pages/about-tbj-gourmet,"About TBJ Gourmet
Bruce Kramer came up with a lovely idea for his Philadelphia Eagles tailgate menu: Bacon Jam and Goat Cheese-stuffed Jalapeno Poppers. His creation, particularly the bacon element went over so well that his friends said, “You should sell this Bacon Jam!” Bruce brought his Bacon Jam to Chef Michael Oraschewsky who fell in love with it. Oraschewsky created some new varieties and they started selling online. (August 2013)
After huge online success they started selling travelling around an selling Bacon Jam at festivals all over the East Coast. Soon stores started to pick up the product and Michael went on QVC to introduce spreadable bacon to all of America. (2013-2014)
TBJ Gourmet is now a maker of fine foods that are fun. Bacon Jam is still our core product line but we are always thinking, cooking and tasting in order to create quality foods you did not know you couldn’t live without.
Bruce Kramer is a Drexel Engineer who was an IT consultant before starting TBJ Gourmet. His love of food and home brewing made him the perfect partner for a company like ours. His favorite dish with Bacon Jam is his own creation, Bacon Jam swirl ice cream. Fun fact: Brice is a certified beer judge and award-winning brewer!
Micahel Oraschewsky is a chef and restauranteur who has helped develop multiple products and concepts. A graduate of Millersville University, he opened his first restaurant at 24. His favorite Bacon Jam dish is bacon glazed scallops. Fun fact: this Renaissance man is a fluent German speaker and white water kayaker who has travelled extensively in search of great food."

https://tbjgourmet.com/pages/family-pack-gourmet-bacon,"This month, one lucky contestant will win our GRAND PRIZE below!
The Grand Prize Winner Will Receive:
Black Peppercom
Peppered bacon offers a balance to sweetness and that perfect kick to step up the complexity of flavor. Perfect for deli sandwiches, steak, fish and grilled foods and to spruce up those veggies (our favorite is Brussels sprouts)!
Classic
Our flagship bacon spread bursting with sweet and savory bacon goodness, this flavor pairs well with foods at any meal. Go traditional and try it on a burger or with breakfast foods, or take party appetizers like crackers with goat cheese or brie from ordinary to exceptional.
Sweet Chili
Just the right amount of sweet chili, garlic and bacon give this bacon spread flavor a warm, barbecue-like taste. Step up main dishes such as pork tenderloin, wings and scallops, or make a killer mac'n cheese combo
This product is so delicious. My husband who is a chef too, gave it a thumbs up. You can spread it on toast, crackers, use as a dip as well. I highly recommend it!!
OMG ! I bought this on a whim I have now tried it on burgers and eggs. My mouth is watering just writing this. It’s delicious and adds so much to a quick meal.
This is not my first jar! I love this stuff! Great flavor and nice to have something different on my bagels!!! I will purchase again!"

https://tbjgourmet.com/pages/upcycle,"Our Spiced Tomato Jam is a collaboration with Philabundance, the Delaware Valley’s largest hunger relief organization.
The goal of Abundantly Good, a Philabundance brand, is to take surplus farm products and upcycle them into quality products for those in need. This allows us to uplift our clients through better food, uplift farmers through economic opportunities AND engage socially-conscious consumers in Philabundance’s mission to drive hunger from our communities today and end hunger forever.
Last year, Philabundance rescued 28 million pounds of perfectly good food from going to landfills and distributed it to people in need. This is nothing compared to the sheer size of these two linked challenges: food waste and food insecurity. They found a way to address both issues by creating Abundantly Good, a brand that focuses on a triple bottom line mission of people, planet and profit.
Rescuing surplus food reduces harmful greenhouse gases created when food goes into landfills. Upcycling food ensures that the resources used to grow it (water & energy) are not wasted. These new revenue streams provide the opportunity for farmers to support their families and develop creative business models!
Proceeds from Abundantly Good sales reduce Philabundance’s food costs & provide healthy items to the community.

Classic Bacon Jam
We got a jar of Classic Bacon Jam as a gift a few years ago and ever since then, always keep an extra jar so we don't run out of it!
Great on Cheeseburgers, or Toasted English Muffins or even as an addition to homemade Pizza along with a little Marinara.
We picked up our first jar at a craft fair. I found them online and bought 6 more! I tried it with steak. Delicious!
It was all I thought it would be. Delicious

I gave this as a gift to bacon loving friends. The emergency kit appearance is cute and got some good laughs.
These all have incredible flavor. I have used them on all meats. They are even great on vegetables. I definitely recommend this kit.
I gifted 2 friends with an Emergency Bacon Kit for Christmas.
I had to LOL when my friends ""presumed"" the kit was initially a 1st aid kit for their pontoon boat. When they actually looked at the kit, everyone burst out in cheers and laughter.
The uncured bacon jam was immediately added to the charcuterie board, and both the smoked bacon maple sugar & smoke bacon salt were used on a large venison roast!
I have to agree with another poster, I did not like the added chemicals in the salt and brown sugar products. :/
I bought this for my brother in law for Christmas and he really enjoyed it. He said he sprinkled the bacon salt on his eggs and it was great! I was happy to be able to give a gift that was different than the usual.
Was not pleased to see chemicals in lieu of bacon for the brown sugar and salt"

I tell everyone about this salt. It makes my salads sing! As a mostly vegetarian, it has been a game changer and can be used in so many ways. I mostly do salads, but love it also on potatoes.
I have tried a variety of products that claim to be delicious bacon salts. More recently, this company came to a local festival. I purchased a jar in fell in love immediately! it’s especially delicious rubbed on chicken just before grilling! I just purchased a whole box of this seasoning since they seem to have been out of stock for a while. We’ll see how long this lasts because we use it all the time! It’s also amazing on eggs, added to streak, and good an any of your savory foods. My favorite part is the quality ingredients. No garbage.
I discovered this at a small farm stand in Plympton Mass. I use it daily on my egg! This is my third order. Just enough bacon flavor with salt to make my breakfast complete. I wont eat an egg with out this salt, you have spoiled me. Quick shipping, easy ordering.
I use it instead of regular salt! Great flavor
This is the perfect spice for ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. We especially love it on pork chops. It will be a spice rack staple from here on out."

The first one was broken, but you replaced it very quickly! It is fantastic!
I loved it!
Delicious! Great kick!
Great in a rice bowl or on quesadillas. not bad on a cheeseburger. Sweet with savory bacon & onion and that peppery kick at the end makes it awesome. I will buy again."

Id love to review this however my item was never delivered and usps told me it was lost. what a shocker considering how incompetent they are.

This is the best tomato jam I've tried.
If you read my review for the Maple-Burbon Bacon Jam you already know I am sold on the outstanding customer support provided by this company. That being said, lets discuss ths killer condiment. I've used it on scrambled and fried eggs, burgers, as a replacement for catsup with french fries and rings, and on steamed vegetables. Today I mixed it with Tartar sauce and created the most delicious and unusual sauce for fried Atlantic Cod filets you can imagine. You will love this, guaranteed!
I first had the TBJ tomato jam when I purchased a grilled cheese sandwich from my local cheese shop more than a year ago. Sooo good. So good, in fact, that I bought 6 jars as gifts for family this year.
This was very good. I've had in not only on hamburgers but I also used to make and top a meatloaf. You won't regret buying this.
This is a “must-have” at our house. It is delicious and versatile. I have given it to friends who also now use it frequently."

Sweet Chili Bacon Jam

Just the right amount of sweet chili, garlic and bacon give this bacon spread flavor a warm, barbecue-like taste. Step up main dishes such as pork tenderloin, wings and scallops, or make a killer mac 'n cheese combo.
I use the sweet chili or regular on hot dogs, burgers, turkey clubs, breakfast sandwiches....if it's bread and meat Bacon Jam goes on it
This or the peppercorn version have become essential additions to a good hamburger.
I want to try it in a dip with cream cheese sometime..
I'll always have to have this stuff in stock now!
Can't review yet, it's a gift.
Some sweet chili sauces are too hot for me, so to try this one was going to be iffy. It's P. E. R. F. E. C. T. Perfect marriage of sauce and jam. Not too hot...just right!
This stuff is awesome. Great bacon flavor. I’ve tried it on hamburgers, hotdogs and even grilled cheese sandwiches. Will definitely order again."
