0,https://www.seatak.com/applications.html,"Designed for coral reef restoration, coral propagation, and aquascaping, SeaTak™ is a strong, slow-setting adhesive that is highly loaded with calcium carbonate and formulated to be sticky underwater and in moist environments. It forms a non-flexible permanent bond to many surfaces such as live rock, aragonite, limestone, metal, wood, plastics and many more. Once fully cured, it can be drilled, filed, or otherwise mechanically shaped. SeaTak™ cures to a white-yellowish hue and is rated at tensile strength of 1,000 psi.
WHY DOES THE WORLD NEED SEATAK?
Coral reefs hold over 35% of the world's diversity and are disappearing at an accelerating rate. By reestablishing reefs with cultivars that are heat resistant, groups throughout the world are attempting to save this ecosystem. SeaTak’s non-toxic, fast-curing adhesives are a step forward in this effort.
""While it may seem like a simple issue, finding a more effective adhesive has the potential to result in a three times efficiency increase for coral outplanting overnight. While there are other challenges to scaling up, this one will have the most immediate effect.”
-Tom Moore, NOAA Coral Reef Restoration Program Manager

HOW DID SEATAK BEGIN?
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration awarded a Phase One SBIR grant to develop a fast, strong, and safe underwater adhesive system to attach new corals during reef reconstruction. As a result of our team's groundbreaking efforts, SeaTak has developed a system that can be deployed in salt water in a fraction of the time and the cost of existing systems."

SeaTak is a totally new kind of adhesive and is the first substance of its kind that uses biomimicry to adhere and join different materials underwater. For hundreds of years people have wondered and been impressed by the ability of mussels and other bivalves to attach to reef and underwater structures and it was a big topic of discussion in many of our marine science classes."

These stunning, living ecosystems support beautiful and healthy coastlines, and play a critical role in our world.
Let’s delve into some facts about coral reefs and discover why they are so vital to protect.
What Coral Reef Is
Did you know that coral is a living animal?
Coral reefs are made up of thousands of tiny corals. These coral colonies are called polyps.
Is coral a plant?
Sometimes people think that coral reefs are made up of plants. They certainly do look like beautiful plants in a way, but they are actually marine invertebrate animals. They have plant-like cells living inside.
Just like a jellyfish or a sea anemone, coral is also classified as Cnidarians.
Coral has a hard calcium carbonate exoskeleton that is fixed into one place. Each coral polyp has a mouth and a stomach. They continuously divide and grow, creating a blanket like reef along our coasts.
Coral reefs grow for thousands and thousands of years, and they can become extremely large!
Some Cool Facts About Coral Reefs
Coral colonies, if kept healthy, can live for hundreds of thousands of years - and possibly eternally. There are many reasons to study and save these fascinating coral reefs.
Facts About Coral Reefs:
1. They Sometimes Glow: Corals can appear in many vibrant, glowing colors. This is because they naturally produce fluorescent pigments. Researchers think that these pigments create a vibrant shield against the dangers of UV light.
2. Hundreds of Species: There are literally hundreds (and possibly more) species of coral. They are a highly diverse animal, coming in a variety of colors, tones, shapes, and different sizes.
Some kinds of coral look like tree branches - literally branching out into amazing shapes. While others are soft and wave back and forth in the water, like a fan. Another kind of coral looks like a brain, and is called a brain coral. And pillar corals grow high and tall, making a unique formation, much like a NYC skyline.
3. They Swim And Move: Another fun fact about coral reefs: young coral can actually swim when first produced, while older coral is attached to the ocean floor. The young coral move to other locations and can land to create a new colony.
4. They Eat: Every coral polyp is capable of eating. They have what is called stinging cells in their tentacles. They use these to catch and eat tiny plankton (small plants and animals), much like a jellyfish does. Also, algae lives within the coral cells, and that is another source of food for the coral.
Coral Reefs Protect Us And Our Oceans
The coral reef’s impact factor is enormous. Coral reefs provide much needed homes for underwater animals to live.
Think of coral reefs as a giant landlord or guardian of the sea - like trees are to forests - homing countless coral reef wildlife. All of their tiny nooks provide a safe space for many creatures of the ocean community. As well as protecting many endangered species.
The beautiful coral reefs also serve as a source of food (and massive income) for millions of earth’s people. Without them, we wouldn't have our much-desired ocean beaches. They protect our beaches and shorelines from damaging waves, erosion, and even disastrous flooding. Their protection provides tons of jobs and recreation - estimated at about $10 trillion dollars in protection in a single year!
Coral reefs provide much-needed medicine! Research shows that the tiny organisms found on our coral reefs can help to produce treatments for many human diseases, including: cancers, cardiovascular diseases, stomach ulcers, and more. The wealth of coral reef’s health benefits are still being discovered. Much current research on cures for cancer concentrate on marine organisms, most of which are located on coral reefs.
Literally billions of people truly rely on our beautiful coral reefs for food, income, and protection.
Coral Reefs Should Be Protected
Coral reefs provide so much good to us and our world. We must protect and preserve reefs from reef erosion and damage, as much as possible.
What damages coral reef health:
So, how can we protect our stressed coral from the many human threats to coral reefs?
There are many coral reef restoration methods available and coral reef rehabilitation centers do so much good. However, there are many small steps that can be taken to protect the beautiful healthy coral reefs and coral reef food webs in our oceans.
Here are some small steps that you can take to help out:
SeaTak™ Aims To Help Coral Reefs
SeaTak™ is doing their part to help coral reefs by thinking of safe, dynamic solutions for coral and ocean restoration.
What is coral and ocean restoration?
Coral and ocean restoration is done by programs, organizations, alliances, groups and everyday people who devote time, money, energy and resources with the goal to protect and restore coral and coral reefs. With coral bleaching happening all around the world at an alarming rate, efforts to intervene and rehabilitate dying and damaged coral is greatly needed. Many groups are propagating coral in labs and nurseries, preparing it to be out planted in specific locations to promote regrowth and new growth of coral. All in hopes of a future of our world continuing to house coral reefs as a beautiful and healthy functioning part of our ecosystem.
How does SeaTak™ help?
SeaTak™ is used safely to repair coral in labs and on reefs in the open ocean. It is a ground-breaking adhesive that is inspired by the chemistry of blue mussels. The solution is easy-to-use, works underwater, is long-lasting, durable and nontoxic.
SeaTak™ addresses several rates of limitation in coral restoration including but not limited to, time, economics, equipment and personal. Another green fact about SeaTak™ is that it does not burn coral or release dangerous toxins into our ocean water. It also reduces the plastic footprint as to current industry standards while increasing productivity (by orders of magnitude).
This revolutionary underwater glue is the perfect choice for even the most challenging underwater projects.
Together we can make a difference in our world."

For hundreds of years people have wondered and been impressed by the ability of mussels and other bivalves to attach to reef and underwater structures and it was a big topic of discussion in many of our marine science classes.
The SeaTak solution mimics the chemistry of bivalve adhesive to create a long-lasting, durable, nontoxic, easy-to-use bonding agent at long last harnessing the power of the humble mussel. SeaTak seems to be really targeting their underwater adhesive towards underwater reef restoration, which can be very lucrative and supported by very expensive treatments, so hopefully SeaTak isn’t wildly expensive.
The company exhibited last weekend in Milwaukee where they demonstrated their product’s ability to bond corals to frag plugs within a few moments, and they claim it fully cures within five minutes. Since SeaTak was developed by mimicking the biological polymers of mussels the product is completely non-toxic, reef safe, and their tagline is that SeaTak is “Stronger than the Reef Itself”.
Unlike super glue which is excellent at bonding smaller things, SeaTak will also be available in a caulking tube for serious underwater joining of rocks and larger colonies, more applicable for true reef restoration but should come in handy for underwater aquascaping of existing live rocks. We don’t have any reservations about SeaTak’s claims for reef restoration but we’re eager to discover how well the adhesive will perform in a reef aquarium setting, whether it will excel for frags and/or rocks, and especially whether it will be cost-effective compared to the adhesives we already use.
The natural polymer-based SeaTak looks very promising and we sincerely look forward to trying it our for ourselves when it finally becomes available. Anyone can request a sample tube from the SeaTak website and we sincerely hope the new adhesive lives up to its lofty claims."
