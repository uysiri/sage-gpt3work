The greatest threat to modern China comes not from foreign invasion, but in the form of bicycles, millions of bicycles.
Chairman Xi Jinping take notice, the greatest threat to China is not from America, it is from the bazillion bicycles you’ve permitted to infest your sidewalks. Bicycles now cover pretty much every vacant piece of concrete and asphalt from Beijing to Urumqi. What am I talking about? The billion or so bike share start-ups that are now brilliantly exploiting what every entrepreneur should know about: public goods.
Look around anywhere in China lately and you’ll quickly see scads of bike-share bikes everywhere. There are ten or so leading companies, each with its own distinctive paint scheme and bike design. These bike services allow anyone to make either a large, one-time upfront payment (say $500 for life-time usage rights) or to make monthly subscription payments, like $20 a month, for unlimited use of that companies bikes. After subscribing or becoming a member, the user can take any bike from that company that they find, from any location, and ride it to wherever they want, then just leave it there. It is bikes on demand.
The bikes automatically lock themselves and can be opened by taking a picture of the bike’s individual ID tag using the bike-sharing application on their phone. To make the service convenient, the bikes are ubiquitous and deposited along almost every street, all over town. Their presence on sidewalks, now impassable, and other areas around the city have become a blight and a danger (tell me about it, I had to jog in the street sometimes to avoid both stationary and moving bikes that formed a dynamic death maze on the sidewalk).
However sketchy to pedestrians, this business model is proving to be very popular in the smog and traffic-choked cities of the middle kingdom. In cities where parking is very hard to find and the sheer number of cars causes massive disruption akin to the plagues of Egypt, bike-sharing solves an important human need for cheap and reliable local transportation. And in that success lies a powerful lesson for the eagle-eyed entrepreneur: leverage public goods to get a free lunch.
Public goods are things that we commonly share, like roads, sidewalks and schools. They are typically free to use for the public. A free asset to leverage is more than just nice for start-ups that can utilize these public goods rather than invest in the same resource for themselves, often at very great expense. In the case of China’s bike menace, the public good is the sidewalks all around town where their bikes can be parked. If the bike start-ups had to build their own bike parking lots across the entire city, the whole venture would be too cost-prohibitive. By leveraging a public good, they dramatically lower their cost structure and have a viable path to market.
Other start-ups can learn from this model. For example, if you’re starting a night school for adult learners, why build a school building and invest a lot in capital expenditure when you could just lease unused classrooms at night from your local school district? Using that public good is a lot cheaper for you to get started, even if you have to pay a nominal fee for it.
Another good example of this is the interstate highway system. This public good is a boon to car manufacturers and transportation companies that don’t have to bear the full cost of their complementary asset. So if you can find a novel way to use public goods to solve a social problem, you could be on to the next big thing.
Start-ups that have innovative ways to discover and use public goods save capital that can be redeployed into more productive, value-creating work.
Just please remember, don’t block the sidewalks. Runners need space too."

We asked Austin entrepreneurs about business ideas and local resources. They answered. Also, learn about our final BBQ of the year and how to meet our VCs.
In late September, I was told by our office neighbors that there was a way to skip the line at Franklin’s BBQ — you know, the place that shut down Kanye for trying to cut ahead. As it turned out, Franklin’s did have an option for those who could think ahead: the pre-order.
What was originally meant to be a farewell meal for our summer interns turned into our first VC / Entrepreneur BBQ when we found out the farewell was sooner than we’d thought. We had enough meat for 5 hungry entrepreneurs, so we set up a challenge. Entrepreneurs who answered our question would get free BBQ. The catch: they had to have lunch with a VC.
Here’s what we learned from entrepreneurs from our last three BBQs, plus the upcoming challenge + prize that’s bigger than all the rest.

“One issue I see in education crosses over into employment: people need jobs and employers need employees that are ready to perform on day one. Companies and organizations can be more efficient if they hire people that don’t need extensive job training. Most hard and soft skills can be broken down into smaller, more manageable modules that employers shouldn’t have to deal with. My idea is to create an online learning tool that does mini-courses in the skills/areas that employers need the most. Employers will be able to use the tool to list the skill sets they need in employees. People looking for work will be able to use the tool to get hired with the skill sets in greatest demand.” — Julia Simon

Is your business idea an undiscovered gem, or a flaming dumpster fire leading you to your doom? Here’s a quick rule to help.
A lot of entrepreneurs ask me to look at their business ideas since they know what I do for a living. Some are gold, some are meh, most are flaming dumpster fires. It stinks to tell people when their ideas are smoldering rubbish, so most VCs don’t and just politely decline or ignore bad business pitches. Although the full content of our upcoming accelerator/incubator, Sputnik ATX, is still in stealth mode, I’d like to share a quick rule you should apply to any business idea that you want to pursue. It is specific to answering the question: will anyone buy this? A question that is obviously important to everyone except the tunnel-visioned entrepreneur who doesn’t value his equity.
So, would be entrepreneurs, let’s take off our blinders and have an honest conversation about your product and service, and more specifically, the benefit it provides.
I’m hoping you already read my post about consumer surplus. If not, read thisfirst. I’m going to use a lot of those terms here. Because if you’re going to get someone to buy your stuff, you had better generate a ton of consumer surplus first. Assuming that your idea and business plan can generate value (consumer surplus), you still may have a lot of trouble finding people who want to buy it because the switching cost still exceeds the marginal benefit. Say what?
Switching costs are what economists call any expense related to stopping the use of one product and service, and beginning to use another. Switching costs may include disposal fees for the old junk, training for new stuff, hardware upgrades, software patches, the time it takes to buy/train/learn the new item, and pretty much anything else associated with the new thing to consume or use. Sometimes these can be quite high.
For example, why do we all keep using Facebook when there are surely other social platforms out there? Because the switching cost includes getting all our friends to switch to the new platform (good luck with that) and also includes information loss when we miss out on posts from our friends still on Facebook or they miss out on ours since we now use some loser platform they’ve never heard of. That switching cost is sufficiently high enough that we don’t switch to Loserbook.
But what if switching has a lot of advantages? The advantages of switching are called the marginal benefit. This is the increase in value we get from switching to a different product or service. For example, if you stop eating at Chipotle and start eating at Qdoba, you get the marginal benefit of free guac at Qdoba (yes, you read that correctly). You also get the added option of queso at Qdoba, and hey, who doesn’t like queso! While this is a good place to add another marginal benefit, not playing the intestinal fortitude lottery at Chipotle, I’m going to restrain myself. Suffice to say that there are some serious marginal benefits of eating at Qdoba versus Chipotle.
Now, if you want to create a new company and provide a new service, you need to provide your consumers a product where the marginal benefits exceed the switching costs in a manner that is obvious and as big as possible. The larger gap between benefit and cost here will greatly influence how quickly people will make decisions to consume your new product/service.
One of the worst products to do this, of all time in my opinion, was the Apple Newton. I can pick on Apple, because they’ve made a lot of smart product launches where marginal benefit kicked the life out of the switching cost, but not on this one (thank you John Scully, I couldn’t have written this without you). Newton was a stinker. For those unfamiliar with it, Newton was a hand-held device that kept digital notes for you. That’s it. You wrote on it, it recognized the handwriting if you used its funky letter system and it converted your writing to digital text. It was also expensive. It cost $699 when launched back in 1993. That is roughly several gazillion dollars today (in Zimbabwe).
You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to know that $700 is a lot to pay for a notepad that only recognizes its own weird version of shorthand. The Newton made you pay an awful switching cost for something that you already had in a simpler, easy to use format and could buy for fifty cents at Walmart. So what happened? People kept buying notebooks that worked great, and the Newton died.
Remember how the Segway was going to revolutionize foot traffic? Yep, switching cost exceeding marginal benefit. There are more. Microsoft Bob? You betcha! Google Glass? Check! The idea graveyard is littered with expensive examples of how brilliant people created incredibly complex and expensive solutions to problems with little benefit beyond what the market currently provided.
Now, Steve Jobs returned to Apple (hurrah) and we got the iPad. It could still be used to jot stuff down, but it also pretty much ran the whole universe. The increased benefit of zillions of apps, made the switching cost paltry compared to the massive benefit provided and, viola! People buy them up the wazoo.
So, if you want to avoid betting your life savings, and that of your investors (me) on something that will never catch on, please do some product soul-searching to see if the benefit your start-up provides is sufficient to cover the cost to customers when they switch. Remember, marginal benefit must massively exceed the switching cost -iPad, not Newton. Of course, you still have to do a lot of other things right to succeed, but this is a biggie so get it right.

Many start-ups fail because they can’t generate sufficient consumer surplus. What the heck is it anyway?
When someone says, “consumer surplus”, I strongly doubt that the first thing that comes into your mind is a burning urgency to make your customers happy. And yet, it should.
Consumer surplus was pioneered by a French engineer, Jules Dupuit, in the 1840s. He proposed the idea that the difference between what you would be willing to pay for something, and what you actually pay for it, is a benefit to you the consumer. This is a surplus in value, that makes you happier. He called it consumer surplus. For example, you may be willing to pay a lot more for that cool phone in your pocket than you really paid for it. I’m hoping you didn’t steal it — that would be illegal surplus, but I digress.
When you create a new company providing a product or service, you have to think about consumer surplus. If your offering does not generate a massive amount of consumer surplus, beyond other substitutes and competitors in the market, then no one will buy your new stuff and your company will fail.
However, if you can aggressively price your service where people feel like they’re getting a steal, then you can create a position for yourself and actually sell something (assuming you’re even charging money to the customer). Of course, Mark Zuckerberg decided to give Facebook away for free, thus creating massive consumer surplus for the billions of people using his service and not paying one thin dime for it.
However, Zuckerberg also creates a massive consumer surplus in another market: advertising. Before Facebook, it was pretty tough to find customers who fit your companies demographic and consumer profile. Most companies did mass mailings to zip codes where they suspected most of the readers had the most affinity for their product/service, or took out massive media campaigns most people saw and ignored since it didn’t apply to them. This advertising was like firing a shotgun into a crowd and hoping you got your target. Not only that, it was very expensive to reach everyone, and that was your only option. For advertisers, Facebook created the opportunity to identify your most likely customers with pinpoint precision, and then only buy the marketing that specifically focused on them. In this way, advertisers were able to save money over traditional campaigns, and get better, measurable results on their advertising (read: boat loads of additional consumer surplus in the advertising market).
So, now that you understand that to grow your business and sell a ton of cool stuff, you need to find ways to increase consumer surplus for your customers as much as you can. Now, look over at your business partner and say, “hey buddy, lets start to brainstorm how we can create more consumer surplus.” If he looks at you funny, please share this post. Well, even if he doesn’t, you probably should share it anyway. It is a nerdy/cool article."
13,https://www.sputnikatx.com/austin-startup-tips-blog/2017/12/7/yes-id-like-100000-but-what-the-heck-is-a-safe-note,"Yes, I’d like $100,000, but What the Heck is a SAFE Note?
When Sputnik ATX funds a company in our program, we give them $100,000 through a SAFE note. This begs the questions, what is a SAFE note, and why use it?
There are two problems with early stage investing: telling how much a company is worth when truthfully, it is still worthless; and helping early-stage companies protect themselves from over dilution when they are, effectively, worthless. Two sides of the same intractable coin.
To solve this, VCs and entrepreneurs need a quick and easy way to provide seed funding, without a long, drawn out negotiation, onerous debt covenants, or a crazy valuation that could hurt the investor and/or the entrepreneur. YC came up with a novel way to do this in 2013 called the SAFE note.
When Sputnik ATX funds a company in our program, we give them $100,000 through a SAFE note. This begs the questions, what is a SAFE note, and why use it?
This article answers these two main questions, and summarizes a few of the terms of the Sputnik ATX SAFE note.
First, what is a SAFE Note?
A SAFE note is a Simple Agreement for Future Equity. This note provides that should we give you funding in the accelerator program, you agree to provide us equity in the future at terms outlined in the note. Think of it this way:
Billy sees his friend Mitch enjoying a Popsicle by the ice cream truck but has no money. Mitch offers to give him the money for his ice cream today if he’ll pay him back tomorrow with ice cream of slightly greater value, hopefully Amy’s Ice Cream because that is just the kind of cool person you are.
That is how the SAFE note works, we give you money today, and you give us shares in your company tomorrow, preferably a good deal for both of us because you’re growing fast.
The SAFE notes gives us the right to trade the note for equity (shares in your company) when you raise additional funds in the future in a qualified round of funding that is priced by the future investor.
SAFE notes have some preferred qualities to convertible debt notes. Unlike debt, the SAFE note does not come with onerous restrictions and covenants that risk insolvency, induce regulations, force interest payments, complicate subordination agreements, etc. It sits on your balance sheet as a form of equity. Think of it as happy equity as opposed to angry debt. Lick Ice Cream, not frozen ice milk in one gallon plastic tubs.
The SAFE note allows Sputnik ATX to invest in your company today, at a price that will be determined in the future, that you can influence in your favor by channeling your inner worker bee and making honey. No need to haggle over valuation with us now, just get funded and get to work. The note will convert in the future when you raise more serious funding and the value of your company is better understood and defined by you and your future investor.
Why use a SAFE note?
SAFE notes have great economic value to both investors and start-ups. For investors, SAFE notes mean that we don’t have to negotiate valuation with all the companies we’re looking to bring into the accelerator. That is a time killer for both the companies and investors, and the resulting valuation is never better than a poor guess regardless of effort. We punt this decision down the road and agree to just convert the note when that value is clearer, and the investment large enough to justify more precise pricing.
SAFE notes also permit companies to clean up their early-stage cap tables without fear of triggering convertible debt covenants that might prevent them from making needed changes. A cap table (for all you cool rookies out there) is a list of everyone who owns shares in your company, as well as the type of shares, value of those shares, and rights of those shareholders; along with the same information for all debts and debt holders.
We don’t like convertible debt for many reasons: it can lead to sub-optimal decisions to avoid covenant defaults, but also can skew debt ratios for some companies that would benefit from SBA loans in the future. SBA loans are a great way to access cheap funding, so forcing early stage companies to take debt seems like a bad idea for equity holders that would benefit from this.
The Sputnik ATX SAFE Note has a couple of key provisions you should understand. Note: there are more, but these are just the ones we get asked about the most.
The note converts at a 30% discount. This means that for the $100,000 Sputnik ATX provides you, it will convert in your next round of priced funding as if I gave you $130,000. That is so that we can capture a small fraction of the value we created before your next funding round. Given the fact that most early stage companies increase value between 100% and 200% between rounds, we think this is a good deal for the entrepreneur. We’re getting you Gelateria Gemelli today, so make sure to give us some more tomorrow.
The note converts at a maximum valuation (cap) of $3mm. This is to protect us from getting diluted in a scam round with your cousin Vinnie where he invests a small amount of money at some crazy high valuation, just so you can cram us down. This is, obviously, not cool. Of course, you would never do such a thing to your VCs, so I assume the cap will not bother you.
The real implications of these two provisions are that they only work if you can grow your company value faster than our discount rate (hooray for everyone) and if you’re company isn’t already worth more than $3mm when you start the accelerator program.
The hard truth is that many people won’t apply to the accelerator because of this second point. They think their idea is worth a whole lot more, so we don’t see them. That is awesome for us, because funding entrepreneurs who have over-inflated valuation bias leads to failed companies (losses) down the road, and we’d like to avoid that kind of investment also.
In this way, our SAFE note is poka-yoke designed to help us screen for entrepreneurs who are in the Sputnik ATX sweet spot: MVP and at least one customer. These are the makers who are ready to grow, and we are here to help make that happen.
We wouldn’t have it any other way!"
14,https://www.sputnikatx.com/austin-startup-tips-blog/2018/5/11/13-ways-to-engage-a-vc,"13 Ways to Engage a V.C.
How to convince the sorting hat that you’re a gentle(wo)man and a scholar, not a wild animal.
Successful entrepreneurs know how to engage VCs. We’re not some elusive species. We’re human just like everyone else, and yet I’m very surprised at how many founders think that we’re jerks when they, in fact, are acting like wild animals. This primer is designed to help entrepreneurs understand VCs a little better in the hopes that we can have more meaningful interactions and avoid some of the blunders that cost entrepreneurs a funding opportunity. Quite frankly, these aren’t just things that drive VCs nuts, they are basic rules for being a good person.
Don’t talk to VC’s when you’re drunk. OK, this seems obvious; however, you’d be surprised how many times drunk founders approach VCs at mixers. For some reason, there is a lot of booze at start-up and VC events that some people enjoy just a little too much. I’m not sure who thought it was a good idea to mix these two things, but I strongly suggest you avoid the bar if you want to impress anyone. I once had a drunk guy come up to me at SWSW and declare, “so you’re one of those {expletive] VCs I’m supposed to be networking with so I can get my company funded, so lets talk.” Needless to say, I moved on.
If you want funding, ask for my advice, don’t ask me for money. It is surprising how often people lead with the money question, and that is just poor manners not to mention bad communication strategy. If you want me to be interested in what you’re doing, ask me for my advice and let’s both find out if I can help you. Look for smart money that will be able to assist your company to grow, and if I see you doing that, I’m more likely to be interested in you also.
If I don’t answer the phone, don’t keep calling over and over (same for texting). Seems like a simple thing, right? And yet, on one deal we were pretty much ready to sign one day when the founder kept calling and calling until my partner and I were just begging for him to stop. He was pestering us to sign the funding agreement, and we were very preoccupied with a credit facility emergency with a different portfolio company that had to be addressed. Our investment in the other company was very significantly greater, and had to be the higher priority. We realized after many back-to-back calls from him that he didn’t respect our time, that things would only get worse if we did the deal and so we decided to walk away from the deal. If founders are jerky up front, things usually don’t get better after we give them money. So just show some good phone manners and respect my time in the same way you would expect.
Don’t monopolize the conversation. Another no-brainer, but one that is repeatedly violated, most often at events where a VC is in conversation with a group of founders from different companies. Typically, we will try to get to know everyone by asking questions to each person about their company and what they’re doing to change the world. Invariably, one or two people in the group think that this is a competition to see who can one-up, interrupt and dominate the conversation. Instead, introduce what you do and ask others the same. VCs will notice that you prefer to learn than lecture, a good attribute in a founder.
Get value from the “no”. If I turn you down, don’t be a jerk. It is OK to ask why I’m not interested, and even to ask if I know a VC that might be interested, but it is not cool to just roast me. VCs say no 95% of the time or more. It is just a simple matter of supply and demand, nothing personal. However; I’m impressed when someone is thoughtful enough to thank me for my time and consideration, then asks if I can share feedback or suggest another VC that might be interested in the investment. That is smart. If I take the time to listen to fully evaluate your company, I started with the idea that this might work. If it doesn’t end that way, ask me why. I may not always feel like I can share, indeed there may be a confidential reason I can not provide, but it doesn’t hurt to ask me why. If you do, you may get valuable feedback to improve your business model or help you realize how your company is perceived. Furthermore, asking if I know anyone who might be interested in your company may result in a referral to a good funding source. So please resist the urge to assume we’re jerks for not giving you money, and get some value from the “no”.
Avoid superlatives, balderdash and hyperbole. Wild claims and broad statements are usually a sign that the entrepreneur is either overconfident, foolish or dishonest . I went to a pitch once where the founder stated that they were the first company to do something when I knew, for a fact, they were not. I knew because I founded a company based upon that same business plan almost ten years before, and sold it to a strategic seven years later. There were, in fact, a lot of competitors, and by stating they were the first, the best, etc., they just showed that they were ignorant of the real market and totally unprepared for funding. Please know the limits of your technology as well as your competitive marketplace, and be prepared to discuss them with honesty and integrity, avoiding the breathless reporting of meaningless, management jargon.
Don’t turn the one minute elevator pitch into five minutes. If a VC gives you a time limit for your pitch, please observe it strictly, unless the VC invites you to go into overtime. This happens a lot on pitch days when companies exceed their allotted time. Look, I know you have a lot to say, but the ability to concisely deliver a compelling message is one of the best indicators that a founder will be successful. Doing so shows that you know how to sell, and respect the time of the person you’re talking to. If you don’t respect other’s time, it also speaks to a lack of empathy and possibly integrity. For fun tips on how to perfect your pitch deck, go here.
Don’t bring up valuation unless I ask first. I previously stated that you shouldn’t lead with money, but let’s be frank: don’t bring it up unless asked first. Talking about your company valuation is kind of like bragging about how much you paid for your pants. No one wants to hear about it, unless they intend to buy some for themselves. So, don’t waste valuable time talking price, until you’ve sold me on the value of the pants themselves. Once I’m convinced that you have a company worth exploring further, I’ll ask and you’ll know that I’m really interested. That is a good signal for entrepreneurs that my interest is piqued, so make the most of it.
Don’t trash talk other VCs or angel investors. Investing is a team sport. Funds don’t go it alone, and we prefer cooperation more than most industries because it reduces risk and improves returns for everyone. We know that it is in the interest of all to get as many smart people as we prudently can to advise and help a portfolio company. VCs invest in teams, with each round of funding bringing in other VC firms who have value and experience that is relevant to the asset. That means that most VCs are frequently friends and serial business partners. I respect them a lot, and value them highly. If you think I’ll be impressed when you trash talk the last office that said “no” to you, well I’m not impressed. That kind of behavior shows that you may have trouble working with other people, and reading a market, both are very bad traits in founders that we seek to avoid.
Don’t show up at anything personal hoping to connect with me, like my kids athletic event, or heaven help you if you knock at my home. Nobody likes a stalker. I’m more likely to call the cops on you than even consider funding your company. Another no brainer, and yet I have more than one example where people tried to pitch to me while I was trying to watch my kids play sports at school. It is nice if you realize that your kids team and my kids team are in the same league, but please, let’s just enjoy the game. Use this time to show me that you can set appropriate boundaries and allow me to enjoy some precious time with my family. Don’t be a stalker.
Google me, find out what I’m interested in, and engage me in a conversation beyond your company. Some might find this creepy cyber-stalking, but I just consider it good recon. If you know the people you want to meet, you’re more likely to be able to build a foundation of trust. Find a genuine area of common interest and build upon it. I’m impressed with someone who tells me that they googled me and discovered an area of common interest and we can chat about that for a while. An important caveat: don’t try to fake it. Disingenuous interest is easily seen through if you only have a quick, Wikipedia education of something I’ve enjoyed my whole life.
Don’t go on and on about where you attended college. I don’t care if you went to Harvard, please show me what you can do. Your education is nice, but there are a lot of people who emphasize it too much, as if education is some kind of guarantee that they are smart. And let’s face it, Harvard is a nice school, a good fall back if you can’t get into the University of Chicago, but where you go to school is not as important as what you are doing with that education. Remember, a lot of smart people don’t go to top tier schools, and will work you under the table. Hungry, resourceful, hardworking brilliance is something VCs look for in founders. Think smart, gritty and determined, not educationally stunted by virtue of lofty expectations with little substance to back it up.
Smile. Yep, I said it. Smile. It is amazing how by just being happy, and feeling good, you subtly influence others to do the same. Smiling is free, and appreciated by all. Launching a start-up company is a full-contact, extreme sport. So, please show that you enjoy the challenge, and help your founding team to stay positive in the face of their challenges. Changing the world is hard but rewarding, so make sure you enjoy the ride."

Every so often, I get an email from an entrepreneur that starts something like this:
“By reading further, you agree to the terms of our non-disclosure and non-compete agreement”
My immediate reaction is to delete these emails with prejudice. I am not alone.
VCs get inundated with pitch decks and proposals for new technology. NDAs or NCAs destroy our ability to freely invest in good ideas, so it is almost impossible to get a VC to sign one. Asking for one, in and of itself, demonstrates a lack of sophistication on the part of an entrepreneur.
The reality of your start-up, whether you want to admit it or not, is that your idea is not Schrödinger’s cat. This refers to a paradox first proposed by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935.
A gross oversimplification of the paradox goes something like this: A cat is in a box with a sensor and poison. You don’t know if the cat is alive or dead. If you open the box to see the state of the cat, the sensor will break the poison and kill the cat. Thus, you don’t know if the cat is alive or dead, and even trying to verify this will result in the outcome of death.
As a start-up company, you may feel like opening the door to someone seeing your idea will kill it, or at the least subject it to competition as others race to replicate your genius, a-la Schrödinger’s feline friend. The reality is far from that.
As a venture-backed start-up, you may benefit from stealth mode to prevent copying for a season, but ultimately comes a time when your technology must be promoted and made known to the world in order for you to find commercial success. Growth is the only metric that matters to a VC, and it is impossible to do this if no one can look at the cat, so to speak.
If the time for the world to know your company is not yet arrived, well then, neither is it the time right for me to consider investing in your company. VCs want to invest when the time-value of their money will produce the best result in the shortest period of time. That time usually happens when you’re ready to go to market (seed stage) or getting traction and want to scale (A round investing).
So if you think your idea is so awesome that anyone in the world even knowing about it would kill it, then you’re not really ready to talk to VCs yet. We like to get involved when you’re ready to let the cat out of the bag, and not be Schrödinger’s start-up."
16,https://www.sputnikatx.com/austin-startup-tips-blog/2018/6/21/3-economic-rules-every-crypto-start-up-must-obey,"3 Economic Rules Every Crypto Start Up Must Obey
There are a ton of people infusing cryptocurrency and blockchain into traditional businesses and asset classes claiming to have some revolutionary breakthrough when, in fact, the business value proposition is nothing more than, well, bananas.
We see a lot of crypto start-up ideas that go something like this: ""We'd like to put bananas on the block chain and trade them with utility tokens. It will revolutionize produce sales globally. Our pre-money valuation for the seed round is 2 trillion dollars."" I've taken some editorial license here, but you get the idea. There's a ton of people infusing cryptocurrency and blockchain into traditional businesses and asset classes claiming to have some revolutionary breakthrough when, in fact, the business value proposition is nothing more than, well, bananas.
I thought I'd take the time to put down some basic ""cryptonomic"" rules to help would-be, block chain titans evaluate if their idea is gold or goop. It all begins with Ronald Coase at the University of Chicago, Laureate for the 1991 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (yes, it does have a cool sounding official name).
In 1937 (yeah, it takes that long to win the Nobel prize), Coase wrote a paper called the Nature of the Firm that revealed the fact that transaction costs are almost always material and do shape economic transactions. For example, if it takes too many clicks of the mouse to buy something online (a non-monetary transaction cost of your time), you'll just go buy something on another website. Transaction costs, while not always monetary, affect our willingness to buy, sell, and engage in a market.
Why does this matter to crypto? Because what crypto and blockchain do, precisely, is reduce transaction costs for certain economic activities. For example, bitcoin makes it possible to transfer money between parties without fees, or oversight from your bank, government, etc. That transaction cost can be high (prison) if you're a drug trafficker or engaging in some other illicit activity. That is why so much illegal activity is transacted using virtual currencies. They lower the transaction cost of the exchange sufficiently to justify the risk of volatility inherent in virtual currencies. I'm not advocating using virtual currency for illegal activity, I'm just saying that it happens for well-understood economic reason.
Overall, bitcoin is probably the lowest transaction cost method to transfer ""money"" securely to anyone, anywhere, for any reason, and at any time.
This leads us to crypto start up rule #1 - the use of crypto or blockchain must lower transaction costs for the economic activity it underwrites.
If you're not actually making it easier to transact an economic activity using your business plan, then you're not creating consumer surplus above traditional market activities and no one will adopt your platform after the initial hype wears off.
The second rule of crypto start ups is due to a government body that was created as an indirect result of Ronald Coase and his pioneering work on transaction costs: the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Some asset transactions require government oversight to even the playing field in public market transactions. This is because asymmetric information (when one party has inside information about the value of something) leads to fraudsters dumpling worthless assets on less-knowledgeable persons. If this insider trading was allowed, it would impose a major transaction cost on public markets from a fundamental lack of trust between two parties in any asset exchange.
To remedy this, the SEC regulates certain asset classes that are publicly traded to ensure that all information provided from insiders with non-public information about an asset, and have control over that asset, share that information with all market participants simultaneously and do not manipulate markets to their advantage. If you try to create an asset for public trade, and then benefit from trading it with inside information, you will go to jail.
This is rule #2: Don't go to prison. Sounds simple, but for some crypto folks, this is a difficult idea to master. If you intend to create an exchange for your crypto tokens where they can be held, bought and sold, then you're business should be regulated by the SEC and you need to hire a regulatory attorney who specializes in crypto assets and make sure that you're idea is lawful with appropriate disclosures and oversight. This isn't cheap to do, but going to prison is definitely more expensive.
Hmm, does that mean prison is a transaction cost of criminal activity? You bet it is!
Now, on to rule number three.
Blockchain is a secure way to share information, plain and simple. If you want to use it for a business purpose, then by so doing it needs to be a transaction where securely sharing information on the blockchain lowers transaction costs sufficiently to act as an incentive to increase underlying economic activity . For example, putting banana information on the blockchain doesn't really help a person buying them at their local Target store get better information in a manner that is more convenient than the sign at the store; however, securely transmitting point of agricultural origin data may be helpful to Target if they have to certify to their shoppers that the banana is organic and their sign is accurate.
To simplify, rule number three is that blockchain should only be used when it lowers transaction costs to securely share and maintain information critical to the underlying economic exchange.
Now, if you're a crypto entrepreneur, you still have to abide by the basic rules of good startups (link shamelessly inserted if you missed it before). So don't think that if you do merely these three things, you're going to be the next Winklevoss twins and the living is easy. Getting any startup off the ground is still a knife fight in an alley with Andre the Giant and he has a gun (as we often say at Sputnik ATX). These are just economic realities that any crypto start-up will ultimately have to face, so better to know up front and assess if your idea has merit before you push your life savings into the next banana-crypto debacle.
In summary:
- Rule 1: The use of crypto or blockchain must lower transaction costs for the economic activity it underwrites.
- Rule 2: Don't go to prison, hire a regulatory attorney and obey the law.
- Rule 3: Blockchain should only be used when it lowers transaction costs to securely share and maintain information critical to the underlying economic exchange.
Now go out and make Ronald Coase proud: start lowering those transaction costs crypto entrepreneurs!

Angel Sheet is the worlds first fully-social, AI infused, machine learning toilet paper, on the blockchain. Yes, you heard me correctly.
You see, Angel Sheet does what no toilet paper has done before, optimizing its cleaning mission with artificial intelligence, learning your individual needs and improving with every use.
Best of all, it is on the blockchain; you can buy crypto tokens to securely keep track of your commode progress and only share it with your absolute best friends.
Best of all, Angel Sheet monetizes the back-end data, selling valuable water usage and disease vector data to hedge funds and medical research companies. This data value alone will enable the company to lower the cost to the consumer of the basic TP product close to zero.
Better yet, Angel Sheet will create an advertising marketplace for its basic product, infusing each sheet with paid images of the hottest trends, influencers, or political ads. Because it is fully connected to the Facebook API, it knows your preferences and adjusts automatically to your needs.
We estimate that everyone in the world will have to have it someday, it will replace all TP as we know it. That means our potential market cap is somewhere between Amazon and Google.
Oh, and did I mention our seed round, pre-MVP valuation range is expected to be somewhere between $500 million and a cool billion. Conservatively.

I am both proud of and annoyed with the #MeToo movement. Women are voicing their hurt and struggles in the face of violent men. Men in positions of power are being held accountable for their actions, and it is a great thing to see. It has fostered a culture where women have the confidence to speak out against sexual harassment. Not only this, women feel more comfortable speaking up to other issues with female equality. However, with all the shouting, men who for years have quietly endorsed women without asking for sexual favors are pushed to the side.
Both men and women flood the internet with indignation. “I stand with women,” they cry. “My heart breaks for the victims of Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby.” But no real solutions are ever posed. There is passion but no planing. We’re all outraged, but how do we actually help?
Women are seeking to climb male-dominated mountains in business. Hopefully, to finally reach the corner office at its peak. In order to tackle the rocky climb, women need sherpas, and those sherpas are mentors. Mentoring and sponsorship are essential for any new member of a field. Of course, in the majority male industries, that means men will need to take on female mentees. If we are going to see any real change for equality in business, male mentors need to buckle up their snow boots and take on the climb.
This may seem radical but it has been practiced all throughout history. As a physicist myself, I have experienced male-female mentoring. Men and women have always worked together in STEM. That relationship was essential for the blossoming of women’s equality in the workforce. You don’t have enough time to listen to my 20 hour podcast detailing only half of their stories, so here is a list of just three extraordinary women who broke through.
Indulge me for a moment while I take you back nearly 150 years ago. I’m a scientist myself! How could I not include Marie Curie’s story? Let’s start with her husband Pierre- a true Frenchman from his name to his goatee. He convinced Marie to continue her studies after she was denied a place at Kraków University for being a woman. Thanks to his persistence, together they went on to win the Nobel Prize for physics. Originally, Marie was not part of the nomination on account of her being female. Pierre, however, insisted she be included. Sure, he probably had different motives for helping Marie than mentors should have nowadays (They got married in lab coats. I’m dead serious). But his dogged insistence that women belonged in the laboratory was revolutionary for his time. He knew his wife had merit, but not because she was a woman. It was because she was a scientist just like he was. That is why he mentored her.
Another example is Sally Ride, the first American woman in space. As a young physics student at Stanford University, she was hesitant to answer a NASA ad in the student newspaper which was seeking applicants for the space program. If not for Professor Arthur Walker’s mentoring she never would have even filed for consideration. As a minority in a collegiate setting, he understood her struggles. He was a black professor, living in America in the 1960s afterall. Using his own experience in paving a path for black Americans, he taught her how to do the same for women. She later recalled his guidance saying, “He instilled confidence and made me believe that I could accomplish what I set out to accomplish.” Her journey to become the first woman in space inspired a generation who saw everything from the launch to the television interviews. She boldly shot down sexist and dehumanizing comments about women in scientific fields. Once when asked if she would wear a bra in orbit by a reporter she replied, “There’s no sag in zero-g.”
I’m also a big sports fan (I play tennis). And, yes, male-female work relationships exist with the best athletes in the world. We can look to the example of Gregg Popovich and Becky Hammon, two big names in NBA. The pair met after the London 2012 Olympics, and clicked through their mutual love of basketball. Hammon was an accomplished point guard for the San Antonio Stars at the time. During their conversation, she asked to sit in a Spurs practice, a rare honor. Popovich agreed. Shortly after, she was awarded the position of an assistant coach working under his tutelage. She was the first woman in the NBA to ever hold an assistant coach position. When asked if this was a political statement, Popovich replied to a NYTimes reporter, “It has nothing to do with her being a woman. She happens to be a woman.” Because of his sponsorship and her own prowess, Hammon is now interviewing for head coach positions in the NBA.
Lastly let me share my own story with Geoffrey Frost, the former VP of Motorola. He took me under his wing to show me how marketing is done in the modern world. Back then, Motorola was a total underdog. That meant we were too. Geoffrey pushed me again and again to outsmart bigger and better-funded companies. At that time, the big bad corporation was Nokia. He showed me that great ideas and radical solutions are what it takes to break into these fields. It didn’t matter that I was a woman or that I came from a cost disadvantage. Under his guidance, we created RAZR and completely changed the company’s trajectory.
I know that I’m not the only one who is dissatisfied with the status quo. Stop talking. More doing. That is what it is going to take if you truly want to help women. Pick one talented woman and give her a chance. Radical shifts can happen without any shouting. Becky Hammon put it best, “If you don’t want a female [in the workplace], don’t hire one! If you want to hire somebody who's qualified and will do a good job, then maybe you should consider me.”

A recent Fortune Magazine article reported that in 2017, only 2% of Venture Capital dollars went to female founders.
Thrive Global spoke to more than 15 prominent VCs to explain how these numbers are possible, what can be done in general to remedy this, and what they specifically can do to remedy these numbers.
Here are our Managing Partner's thoughts:
My Venture Capital Background
Dr. Oksana Malysheva is an investor, entrepreneur and business executive based in Austin, TX. She is the Managing Partner/CEO of Sputnik ATX, an accelerator that funds maker-founders with ideas to create positive change. She is also the Managing Partner/President of Linden Venture Fund. Dr. Malysheva champions the development of innovative, sustainable, world-changing companies. Committed to igniting and fueling social innovation solutions, her mission is creating positive social change through education, technology and innovation. Dr. Oksana Malysheva was born and raised in Soviet Union, Ukraine. Seeking educational opportunities, she moved to the United States with her husband and only $100 to their name. She earned her PhD in physics from the University of Pennsylvania, and soon after, pivoted her focus to business and marketing. Dr. Malysheva previously held top strategic roles at McKinsey and Motorola. Trained as a PhD physicist, Dr. Malysheva brings scientific inquisitiveness, lateral thinking and mastery of insight through data to all of her business endeavors.
What I Believe Is The Root Of This Problem I feel that this issue is somewhat more nuanced than is portrayed in the media. Discrimination and bias have certainly happened in the past, and may still be happening now. But equally there is a lack of understanding how women and men might think, communicate, and present ideas in a different way. The female approach is at least as effective, revolutionary and life changing, but it may come across in a softer voice. As a society we need to recognize and celebrate these differences. Statistics have proven that diverse teams deliver far superior results, and we would be fools not to embrace this. Ultimately, there could be many theories as to what caused the past to be as dismal as it is — I’d rather spend my time thinking about what I can do today to clear the path for women. Focusing on solutions is a more productive use of my time. And the fundamental shift we see in the society now will provide more wind behind the sail.
What We Can Do To Solve This Problem
VC and entrepreneurship fundamentally makeup an apprenticeship industry, so there is a simple thing anyone senior can do today: identify a talented woman, clear a path for her, and recognize differences in leadership styles that are equally effective but can look and sound differently. Do it today. Then find another one, and repeat. I believe that it comes down to the choices that each of us make in our daily lives to promote equality. At Sputnik ATX, we have identified a promising female associate. She is a young, recent college graduate but she has proven herself to be talented. She has helped us to find several smart female interns that in turn, get visibility to the VC process. I guarantee they will crush quite a few gender barriers because they have seen it done, and felt nurtured and supported along the way. The more we take steps like this, and the more positive stories that make it to the news, the more other women will be encouraged to join our cause. The time to show up, speak up and stand out is now. These past stats are pitiful, but the future doesn’t have to be. The choices we make every day will shape the future."

By: Oksana Malysheva
Editor: Emma Merrill
Paul David Hewson the rockstar, philanthropist and frontman for U2 (better known as Bono) has a secret he’s not trying to keep. Capitalism is going to save the world.
This may seem impossible to some readers because there is a notion in America that charity must be purely altruistic or else it is evil. Not only this is not true, it seriously limits charitable growth.
Money isn’t inherently evil. It is an an enabler for change.
In the end, humans are insatiable for the bigger, better, and kinder. There are multiple ways to do this. I am by no means discouraging traditional donations and volunteer channels. I am just wondering, what if we apply the lessons learned in your work and venture life to make it exponentially more effective?
Firebomb Your Preconceptions
The striking thing about our nation is that we are some of the most charitable people in the world. It was astounding to me that people systematically donate their time, money, and efforts without any system forcing them to do so. It goes way beyond “help your neighbor” doctrine.
However, we tend to think that business and charity must be separate. We can spend half our day at a soup kitchen, but in the end, it is us that gain more from the exchange than the needy. Don’t get me wrong. There is nothing wrong with that. By all means, venture on with coworkers and your families to deepen your empathy. This is a good thing.
But to lift up impoverished and underserved communities, we have to do it on a scale only capitalism can tackle.
Consider Dan Pallotta’s argument in Charity Case: How the Non-Profit Community Can Stand Up for Itself and Really Change the World. Dan’s argument is that socio-economic problems are best solved through private industry. That means you’re off the hook for not buying a plane ticket to Niger to fight hunger. Here’s his reasoning as to why:
A Business Week survey concluded that the median Salary of a Stanford MBA graduate at 38 was $400,000. Compared to a Medical Charity CEO who makes $232,658 a year on average or a CEO of a Hunger Charity who makes $84,028 a year, it is cheaper for the average MBA graduate to donate $100,000 to a hunger charity every year then it is to work for one. The charity actually gains greater funding if the graduate stays in the private sector!
My point is, firebomb your preconceptions of what it means to be charitable. Your path to impact isn’t always dropping an extra $5 at a bake sale or those pins you gave to The Ronald McDonald house. Impact happens when creative, innovative solutions are posed to public problems. Those ideas, more often than not, come from the private sector.
Private Industry Saves The World
You think this is impossible? Talk to Bono. You heard me right, the Bono. Money talks and Bono sings. He founded Product Red along with Bobby Shriver. Compare the average yearly donations of Bono’s charity and another. Product Red produces $42 million on average each year. Compare that to amfAR (The Foundation for AIDS Research) another leading AIDS charity at $14.5 million on average per year. That’s $27.5 million more each year!
So how did Bono do it? What makes that red dot so much bigger? What Bono did differently was he got corporate sponsorship.
Product RED has teamed up with Apple, Bank of America, Beats by Dr. Dre, Coca Cola, Starbucks, Snapchat, and even Facebook just to name a few. Remember the red motorola Razr? When you use a RED certified product or service part of the money goes to fight AIDS. Hold on here. That’s morally wrong, isn’t it? Only part of my money went to the charity. These companies are making money off of a good cause!
Yes, they are. That’s a good thing. Here’s why:
Bono found a way for customers and businesses to turn everyday interactions into charitable enterprises. Everyday interactions are generating millions for charity. By what stretch of the imagination is that a bad thing? Let’s face it, that RED Starbucks mug was cool enough you would have bought it anyway. Now you have a product, Starbucks adds to its revenue, and a hospital in Niger gains funding.
What these companies are doing is innovative not evil. Sure, 100% of your proceeds aren’t going to Product RED’s charitable enterprises, but that RED Dell laptop isn’t some “give one get one” prize for doing good. If you really want to, you can make a direct donation to a charity, but with RED, you have a product in your hands that costs a for-profit company money to make.
Don’t Let Large Scales Discourage you
By all means if you’re a Stanford MBA and you want to volunteer your time and services to a hunger charity, do it! But Americans need to acknowledge that if you volunteer at a soup kitchen that makes a different impact than a large scale cash donation.
In the one-on-one contact you gain from personal service, you are awarded just as much as the person you’re serving, if not more.
This isn’t a bad thing. In fact, it is an important part of staying in touch with our human empathy. This capitalist donation model can somewhat remove the donor from the human experience. We are able to make change happen faster, but traditional charity is more personable. Neither one is necessarily better than the other, and each of us has something different to give.
Take for instance, doctors without borders. Doctors give their time (9-12 months of it according to their website) to go make the world a better place. This is of course a worthwhile effort, but the impact it makes is different. The social impact is personal rather than on a grand scale. It’s just as worthwhile and by all means pursue it.
But consider the possibilities if we don’t throw away capitalism’s potential based on a well-meaning but mislead sense of morality. Let’s use more if its immense power for good."

Three rules to avoid getting scammed by advisors.
As an early stage VC, one of the saddest things I observe from meetings with founders is the toxic and pervasive influence of what I call the start-up industrial complex (the SIC).
The SIC is a universe of charlatans and blissfully unaware “advisors” who masquerade as help for early stage companies and, in fact, set them back or bleed them dry for the personal gain of the advisor. There is an almost infinite number of people desperate to take money out of the entrepreneur’s pockets, so I thought I’d write a post about how you can identify and protect yourself from the posers and in the process learn how to identify real help that is there for you.
SIC members usually ask for cash upfront to perform tasks for start-up companies. It may be they offer a so-called, proven method to develop fundraising decks (laughable, when you can get the best advice free from YC), or perhaps an introduction to a prospective investor or customer. Regardless, the first warning sign that you’re among the SIC is when they ask for cash upfront to “help” you.
Rule Number One:
the best help for start-ups comes from proven leaders who don’t need cash from your seed capital and genuinely want to help ideas they believe in.
Another red flag is when a SIC member asks for equity in your company upfront, without any performance vesting standards. For example, “give me 5% equity in your company and I’ll give you advice and allow you to use my face on your slide deck to raise money.” This is a bad deal for you, if you take it.
Rule Number Two:
when giving equity, it should always vest over time for performance tied to measurable goals such as sales or results that move your KPIs.
Most SIC members are either burned-out, serial founders who never got an exit, or someone who had a senior management position in a large, mature company. Both types of these people have experience, but they don’t have the experience you need. Failure can be a good teacher, but founders who have not gone through the full process of start-up to exit may just repeat the same failure lessons, and share their mistakes with you. Similarly, big companies may be good at what they do, but the people who work in them are not familiar with the effort and methods to create and grow something from scratch on a small team with a limited budget. Many of these people have good intentions, but they just don’t speak start-up, and are more dangerous when they think they do.
Rule Number Three:
Seek advice from people who are either successful founders or VCs, better yet, someone who has done both.
Founders, we love you and want to see you succeed. So beware of those who come looking for cash, free equity, or have nothing to contribute to your future success. The SIC is real, spread the word and beware!"

Have you heard of FYRE Festival? What about Theranos? The Netflix and HBO documentaries exposed them as being some of the most fraudulent scams to date.
Believe it or not, Elizabeth Holmes and Billy McFarland have something to teach you: why storytelling is essential to building a cult-like following. Whether you use storytelling to build a great business or a fraudulent scam is up to you, but ultimately, storytelling is an imperative craft.
Sinek describes the storytelling craft with the illustration below. Many leaders make the mistake of telling their stories by starting from the outside, but iconic leaders, like Steve Jobs, start their stories from the inside-out.
This might seem obvious to the astute startup founder, but it’s shocking how many forget that if you don’t take the time to explain your ‘why’, you have a good chance of losing your audience on your ‘what'.
Now that we’ve explained why you should start with ‘Why’, here are three tips to keep in mind as you plan how to captivate your audience from the start:
Explain the Problem
For startups, specifically, if investors don’t understand your ‘why’ (i.e. the problem you’re solving), they won’t understand your solution and why it’s needed.
Note: YCombinator, the Silicon Valley accelerator that helped companies like AirBnB and Stripe in their humble beginnings, starts with the ‘why’ in their seed deck template.
Focus on the Present in Your Hook
In a recent workshop at Sputnik, our guest speaker Noah Zandan talked to our startups about how to get your message across effectively and how to be a visionary leader. Noah’s company collects and analyzes data on leaders’ speech and presentation styles and audience reception.
According to Noah’s research, one factor that makes or breaks effective communication is talking in the present more than you make assertions about the future. In his TED talk, Noah uses the example of Elon Musk, who introduces the question Tesla is trying to answer - how to accelerate the advent of electric transportation - in order to talk about his company’s plans for the future.
Posing a question is just one way to explain the ‘why’ in the present, but you can also hook your audience by telling a story or citing a surprising statistic that illustrates your problem.
Be Concise
Brevity is important, especially whether you’re networking at a meetup or making a formal presentation. If you’re going for maximum simplicity, the “X of Y” formula can be an effective way to explain your why and what in one sentence. Oftentimes this formula has a built in ‘why’ if the Y is well known, because it borrows a similar problem and solution from a different industry.
For example, Tenavox, a company from Sputnik ATX’s third cohort, is changing the way small business owners find office space. Instead of describing them as a commercial real estate leasing platform (snore) when we talk about them, we instead describe them as “the Zillow of commercial real estate.”
On a scale of cardboard to chicken noodle soup, how much more digestible was that information? I’d go with the soup."

I recently saw data from Y Combinator comparing what founders consider their biggest obstacle, then contrasting that with a list of the things proven to grow companies fast (what you really need). To be clear, high growth is all that matters when it comes to proving product market fit. Nothing says “people need our stuff” like hoards falling all over themselves to obtain your product/service.
What you think holds you back:
Startup Funding (from investors)
Bug fix (make it work better)
Design (make it easier to use and pretty)
What actually holds you back:
Launch (get product to market)
Design (make it easy use and pretty)
Pricing (create consumer surplus)
Remember, high growth covers a multitude of sins.
Short on cash? Sell more. Product buggy? Get code fixes to market now.
Alternatively, Failory did a study that patterned start up data to identify why some fail and some succeed. The 4 reasons for failure generally fell into four categories:
Incompetence – lack of planning Inexperience – lack of product know-how Inexperience – lack of managerial skills Personal problems – you’re a hot mess.
The worst thing you can do, is say to yourself, “I believe, therefore I am right.”
Note, three of these categories are, by definition, items that founders may lack and fall into the false premise, “I believe, therefore I am right.”
We see many founders who fail to identify that they are in one of these categories. Successful founders know that they are always one or more of these, and fill their gaps by building a diverse team that is united and motivated around common goals and vision. It takes humility to assume you know nothing, and build a team with the skills to succeed. And humility is what you really need.
Humility will help you get MVP to market faster because you know it will never be perfect. Humility will make the product better because you will not assume you know what the customer wants and will listen to them. Humility will help you to identify who you need to execute your vision, and inspire them to follow you, especially when times are tough.
In short, develop your company with humility, so you can grow with confidence."
24,https://www.sputnikatx.com/austin-startup-tips-blog/2019/11/24/lets-talk-self-care,"Let's talk self-care
As entrepreneurs, we take pride in working 12-hour days, working through weekends, and not having an ounce of a social life. Our days are often fueled by lots of caffeine and little nutritional food to get through it all. And self-care … what’s that?
We’ve all heard this term, right? Millennials and Gen Z are obsessed, and believe it or not, it’s grown into an $11 billion industry. Self-care can take form as an expensive yoga class or saying ‘no’ to a night out, but ultimately, everyone has a personalized best-practice that works for them.
Sputnik ATX CEO Oksana Malysheva preaches staying on your game while building a business because guess what? Your business is only as good as you are.
The first step is to take a step back. Working 100+ hours a week may not be the best for your physical and mental health
The next step is to experiment with a few self-care practices to see what works best for you. We asked our summer 2019 cohort founders what their best practices are.
“I spend some time every single day in silence, and meditate. It's always the first thing in the morning, after lunch and at the end of the day when I get home.” said Tradiies co-founder and CEO April Snow. “It can range from 5-10 minutes, to a full hour. It cleanses my mood and helps me to set new intentions and replenish.”
OpenTeams co-founder and COO Eunice Chendjou said, “For me, it’s working out every morning at 5 am. I love weight lifting, it makes me feel strong.”
There are many forms of self-care, some more traditional than others. For instance, UConnect Esports co-founder and CEO Dylan Liu enjoys walking around grocery stores.
Here is another list of self-care ideas for you to implement into your daily or weekly routine. We all deserve one or two of these, no matter how busy we are.
- Make your favorite home-made meal (and turn off your phone while you eat it)
- Do something that energizes your body (yoga, running, climbing to name a few)
- De-clutter (your inbox counts too)
- Journal consistently
- Stop screen time at least an hour before you try to go to sleep [1]
The last step is to give yourself a pat on the back. Admitting you need a break is hard. We’re conditioned to be busy all the time and be shamed when we’re not working. Yes, give your 100% to your company, but be sure you’re at your 100% too."
25,https://www.sputnikatx.com/austin-startup-tips-blog/2019/2/14/in-defense-of-valentines-day,"In Defense of Valentines Day
Ok, I am the first to admit that this is an unusual plea from a hard-driving, rational physicist turned Venture Capitalist. So, what on Earth am I doing defending this Hallmark Holiday?
Indulge me while I make this connection. One of the things that I care about professionally is to future proof startups and equip them with what they need to make their business a resounding success. How do we do that in an environment where odds are 9 out 10 startups fail? And does it have to be this way?
There is a lot written out there on the business side of this journey, including by us at Sputnik ATX.
But here, I will address the emotional side of starting a business. As humans, particularly startup humans, we are very resilient, and we should be. With every startup that goes through Sputnik, we are brutally honest with our founders about what it takes to grow a startup, and the emotional toll you have to pay.
You are in an eighty-hour-per -week grinder, where every other day is a fight for survival; where you do not know where the next round of funding is coming from; where you might have separated from your co-founder and re-built the team; where your most trusted developer that you relied on to finish the product release is lured away by your bitter rival; where your biggest customer you have been cultivating for a while has a change in direction and leaves you hanging; where your trusted partner leaves you overnight with just an email notice and you are left to pick up the pieces of the broken project all by yourself. Sound scary? It should. This list goes on and on.
I really wish I could tell you that all of the above are singular events that happen once in a lifetime. But the reality is these are regular occurrences for every successful startup founder. Also, let me remind you that unlike the overnight unicorns you might have read about in the news, it takes most companies 8-10 years to go from inception to stability. As I have mentioned above, it is anything but a straight line to stardom.
So what do we do? How do we survive and keep bringing our very best to our teams, our customers, and the world around us? What gives us strength to keep delivering on our mission for eighty hours per week for the next 8-10 years?
The secret to this is to build strong support networks, and to start with your loved ones. It may be your spouse, you parent, your child, your friend. A lot of you right away argue with me that you don’t have time in your above mentioned 80 hour week -- it is just not possible, and maybe you’ll offer five other well rounded reasons on this.
I emphatically disagree. First off, it is not the time, it is the intention. Most kind and thoughtful things we do for each other are not long and tedious. Let me ask you this:
How long does it take to give your child an extra long hug How long does it take to genuinely compliment your spouse on something that is special about them? How long does it take to call your mom on your way to work? How long does it take to play hockey (or in my case tennis) with your friends What about a walk with your friend, or a meal/ manicure/ golf with your girlfriends?
If you are honest with yourself, the answer is “not that long, I have just not thought about it in this way.”
Your time with your loved ones may be short, but make it intentional, non- negotiable and be present when you show love. As your VC advisor, I would say that the ROI on these minutes would be one of the highest you have achieved on that day.
I love life hacks, so let me offer one from the amazing coach Brendon Burchard. He sets a daily alarm on his phone to remind himself to give love to the love of his life, Denise. What would your “love alarm” be?
I’m no love coach, but I am an entrepreneur who is married to entrepreneur. My husband and I have lived this lifestyle for more than a decade while raising two amazing kids. We have made SO MANY mistakes in this area that I am seriously contemplating a book. We took each other for granted, put our businesses ahead of each other, and came dangerously close to not recovering from this turmoil. Without a shadow of doubt, not catching ourselves in time would have destroyed us and, as collateral, would have affected our businesses. We were lucky to see the warning signs and figure it out, and we did not work any less in the process.
Your mental toughness and ability to make into reality what was science fiction yesterday rests squarely on your ability to rejuvenate. To be able to do that, you will need your loved ones in your camp. They will remind you how strong you are when nothing goes right,. They will kick you off the pedestal should your head get too big after you raise that new round. They will help you make it through this hard and long journey. They will make it fun.
So, stop reading this post, get out there, and do something special and surprising for someone you love. After all, Hallmark and Oksana are telling you so :)
Happy Valentines Day!"
26,https://www.sputnikatx.com/austin-startup-tips-blog/2019/2/27/smwatx-what-i-learned-about-marketing-on-linkedin,"#SMWATX: What I Learned About Marketing On LinkedIn
Is LinkedIn worth exploring for marketing your business? Here’s what I learned at Social Media Week ATX.
""What is LinkedIn Anyway??""
That’s what I wrote on page six of a fresh Sputnik notebook, under a list of marketing goals back in December. I had a hunch that LinkedIn had the potential to be a valuable channel, especially for startups like us (and our startups. #meta) who market to businesses.
But, my millennial brain was used to Instagram. I had yet to fathom LinkedIn as a social tool beyond Traci presenting the very tempting offer to drop everything and get a degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling:
So, when I saw that LinkedIn would be the subject of two talks at Social Media Week ATX, I jumped at the chance to grasp this elusive network and ride it into the sunset.
Here are five things I learned about using LinkedIn for business from Marcus Murphy, Director of Sales and Monetization at DigitalMarketer (plus, ehem, he’s now on the advisory board of LinkedIn) and Joshua Lee, founder of Standout Authority.
#1: Does the thing you’re selling appeal to LinkedIn's users? Consider that there are 550 plus million members on LinkedIn, where the average salary is $116,754. Compare that to an average salary of ~$58,000 on Twitter and ~$61,000 on Facebook. Here's a 2022 update on LinkedIn user demographics.
#2: As Marcus said, ""H2H (human-to-human) is the new B2B."" Robots haven’t quite taken over the world yet, and the being purchasing your SaaS product is still a human. Don’t be afraid to get a little personal with your posts, but drunk charades are still TMI.
#3: LinkedIn articles rank well in search engines, and skimmable listicles are a good format for LinkedIn blog posts. Professionals on LinkedIn are busy! Post your articles and updates with easily digestible photos or videos, tag people and businesses, and engage with those who engage with you. Hot tip: thank them for taking the time to engage with you and endorse their skills.
#4: LinkedIn is earning its right as a social platform by being simultaneously awesome and creepy. Now you can add everybody in the room on LinkedIn with the “find nearby” feature. If you’re speaking at an event, share your LinkedIn QR code on your slides and you can immediately get a billion new connections. Isn’t that what we’re longing for in this world after all? *nervous laughter
#4: Unlike platforms like Instagram and Twitter, where brands typically communicate through brand pages, LinkedIn is all about person-to-person connection. In your headline, delete your job title and switch to the “I help X achieve Y so they can do Z” format. And for the love of all things holy, always send a personal message when connecting with people (!!!). In fact, everybody on your team should do this. Articles should be hosted under team member profiles, and the ones that perform best should be posted on the brand page."
27,https://www.sputnikatx.com/austin-startup-tips-blog/2019/3/18/ut-business-students-are-fighting-snakes-with-memes-heresnbspwhy,"UT Business students are fighting snakes with memes. Here's why.
By: Sarah Bloodworth
Snakes infested UT-Austin’s McCombs School of Business last year, at least according to memes. The joke comparing business people to greedy, competitive snakes seemed to slither into every post on the UT-Meme Facebook page and Twitter.
Perhaps the characterization of businesspeople as snakes generated from the McCombs holiday decoration controversy, but the millennial view of declining business ethics is worldwide. According to a 2018 Deloitte survey, the positive trend towards business ethics reversed in 2018, with only 48 percent of employed generation z and millennials believing that corporations behave ethically. In addition, three-quarters of participants believed that businesses don’t benefit wider society.
Deloitte's conclusion? Overall, businesses don’t prioritize issues that matter to the rising workforce. A majority of participants believe that current companies lack diversity (namely gender and education), environmental consciousness and interpersonal skill training.
So, according to a 2016 Global Entrepreneurs Report, millennials are taking business into their own hands and launching start-ups earlier than other generations. Yet we still see millennial-on-millennial crime as UT-students demonize their fellow “millennialpreneurs.” Plus, as start-ups develop, they inevitably become companies.
But fear not! Here’s what startups can do to avoid Slytherin status in the eyes of Gen Z and millennials jobseekers and fans:
1.Definitions of diversity are...diverse. Ensuring your initial leadership team is diverse in factors like educational background or going from his(ssssss) to her can improve decision-making. For example, an MIT study concluded that simply having more women on a team will improve the collective intelligence of a team due to an increase in social perception -- the ability to read emotions. Also, Deloitte notes that those working for employers perceived to have a diverse workforce will increase loyalty to the company.
2.In the survey, climate change finished in a statistical tie with terrorism as the top concern for millennials in developed markets.
Your first steps in going green doesn’t have to be expensive, as start-ups can take simple steps like using all reusable cups or adding some office-friendly plant friends.
Austin shipping-service uShip took sustainability to higher levels (literally) with their 18 hydroponic growing towers that provide their employees with fresh herbs and vegetables daily. During their inaugural Taco Week, employees can fill their tortilla with sustainably-grown, local cilantro and lettuce. uShip was recently nominated for the Austin Best Place to Work award, which in part had to do with providing these locally-harvested greens from their very own building.
To get your brand out there you can can get involved with contests like this, such as the Austin Chronicle’s “best of” poll.
3.Young professionals want to learn confidence and communication as they enter the workforce. According to Deloitte’s survey, more than a third of millennials say it is “essential” that they develop strong interpersonal skills. But only 26 percent say they are offered support in developing these skills.
Simple strategies can help your initial team start developing those abilities. For example, Office Vibe suggests encouraging employees to eat lunch away from their desk, which prompts conversation and develops their communication skills. Companies can also send their employees to conferences (hello SXSW) or as a cheaper alternative, supply them a subscription to Skillshare or Lynda.com. Transferring these skill-sets will help both you and your team continue to learn and grow.
Once you take the opportunity to attract talent from younger generations, be sure and share your Gen-Z friendly brand through social media. You can showcase your work-force using Instagram story take-overs such as Deloitte’s Millennial Instagram Takeover Series or highlight your values like start-up Afrocenchix who posts vegan recipes and promotes exercise. Spread your positive message, and the rising workforce will be more likely to see your company as a unicorn, not a snake.

28,https://www.sputnikatx.com/austin-startup-tips-blog/2019/4/29/five-questions-every-start-up-should-ask-about-accelerators,"Five Questions Every Start-Up Should Ask About Accelerators
First off, and full disclosure, I operate an accelerator program (Sputnik ATX) and have strong opinions on this subject as a participant in the “helping startups” market. I put that in quotations, because, as I’ll expound, there is a start-up industrial complex that is designed to fleece novice founders from their seed capital with predatory fees, terms, etc. Also, I’m going to start just writing accelerator, because writing accelerator/incubator over and over just reads poorly. OK, enough with disclosures. Read on!
If you’re a breathing human, you’re confused by the veritable potpourri of accelerator and incubator options clogging your inbox. Need help evaluating which one is right for you? How to know which one may or may not help you out? I’m here to help. Here’s a list of questions you should ask to see if your start-up benefits from a program:
Does the accelerator write checks or take checks? Accelerators that give money, usually as equity investments and sometimes as a grant (whoo-hoo if you can get it), are often those who have real “skin in the game” and want to align their interests with the founders. They’re willing to put their money where their mouth is, and back your company. It is important to also ask how they help you get your next check. Some, like Sputnik ATX (yea us!) also write follow-on checks and will lead or participate in seed rounds or A-rounds beyond the pre-seed investment typical of most programs. Programs that do not write checks to the start-up may also be helpful, but you should expect them to add a lot of value in other ways if they are asking for money or even equity (yikes), without making an investment. For example, it may make sense to give up a few points of equity or pay a fee if you have very high confidence that the program will help you double sales, get major traction, or something else that is material to your success, and not just helping you prepare a nice pitch, some simple introductions, etc.
Does the accelerator help me do something I can’t do for myself or speed up a hard thing? Good accelerators identify and invest in companies where they can add value and have experience to offer the founders. Ask the accelerator how they’re going to help you, and be specific. If they can’t tell you how they can help you solve a tough problem or complete a hard thing, move on. Too often, startups believe that just getting into a program will raise their profile, and so they sign up for something that wastes time and money doing things they could have done faster for themselves. It is OK to recognize that a program isn’t going to accelerate you as advertised. One program here in Austin that really does this well is SKU, an accelerator to help CPG start-ups. SKU has a focus niche where they have deep expertise and networks that help companies get onto store shelves, something that is quite hard to do without the industry know-how and experience.
Is the program just trying to get me to buy something? What I mean by this is some accelerators are just trying to sell startups other services, and offer little in the way of help. Good accelerators don’t see you as a customer, you’re a partner that they want to help. A generative relationship should exist between the startup and the accelerator, where the accelerator is spending its time helping you to succeed. If you’re just there to buy products and services from the “accelerator” then the program may just be a marketing channel used by a business to sell coworking space and other advisory services to start-ups without offering much value added. Some coworking spaces may have excellent accelerators, and you’ll only know if they’re awesome when you compare the cost of the required stuff you’ll buy versus the benefit from the space and program.
Is the program merely providing free access to services I can get elsewhere? Some accelerators take equity in exchange for providing services like desk space, credit on cloud services, or “free” consulting. Let me address some of the more common services one by one: Desk space – if you have a place to sleep, you have an office. Giving up equity for a desk is a sub-optimal business decision. If you really need a desk, drive Uber/Lyft for a day and use your earnings to pay for that workspace without diluting your equity. As a bonus, you might meet a cool VC while driving (I met a cool company or two this way, the founders pitched me while driving). Credit on Cloud Services – accelerators get this free from Amazon, Google and Microsoft, so they’re not paying for the perk they offer you. Plus, if you attend some of the Amazon, Google and Microsoft cloud events, you can get this same perk for free directly, without selling your soul. “Free” consulting or advisory work is garbage. Advice should always be free to founders. Anyone who has successfully founded and exited a start-up will usually help you out for free because they know how hard it is to launch. Anyone who needs a paycheck from you is not legit, and is usually someone who is preying upon start-ups to make a living because they failed to do so as an entrepreneur or flushed out of corporate life and have no clue how to successfully start their own company (or they’d be doing it already). For this reason, Techstars has a policy of not permitting advisors or partners helping companies in their program from charging any fees to the company while they’re in the program. If they have value, prove it first. A good policy.
What do the program alumni have to say about its worth? Ask program alumni companies if it was worth it, and then ask yourself if that company has a credible opinion. For example, someone may say a program stinks, but may just be blaming the accelerator for their own business failure and faults. On the other hand, if a successful founder who built a nice business tells you the same program didn’t help them that much, that opinion has more gravitas. Then, find out why it did or didn’t help them, to better understand if the program will help you.
Overall, take some time to learn more about the program, how they add value (if at all), and if that value is what you require at this time. If the value is there, then ask yourself if the cost is worth it.
There are some great accelerators out there, so go find the one that works for you.

The more non-price barriers disappear, the more customers will say yes.
Struggling for sales? One of the things entrepreneurs often don’t consider is the price customers actually pay when purchasing. While price is obvious, there are several less obvious costs to your customer when they acquire a new, shiny thing.
Economists call these non-price expenses switching costs and categorize them into three buckets:
Time cost
Effort cost
Psychological cost
Here are a few examples of these costs you need to consider:
Training costs required in order to fully use a new product or service, for both individuals and companies
Disposal costs related to their current product or service, and perhaps even the future cost of disposing of your product or service
Mental cost of a purchase, time to complete a transaction, like when you have to click ten times and fill-in redundant or unnecessary information to make an online purchase
Integration costs with current business systems or consumer lifestyle, such as legacy database usage or accessing personal libraries online in other applications
Emotional costs related to any change, such as losing a friendship with a rival sales person, or parting with another product where there exists sentimental value to the customer
Finding cost if your product is hidden in the back of a store, or on a shelf top
If you want someone to purchase new product or service, you need to help the customer reduce or eliminate as many of these costs as possible. For example, Amazon.com introduced one click purchasing precisely because it lowers the time, effort, and psychological cost of an online purchase decision. They made it easy to say yes.
You can make it easy to say yes too. Get together with your team, your family, and friends and brainstorm ways you can automate training, disposal, integration, and add features to the purchasing process to eliminate any form of stress to the person making the purchase decision.
For example, if you’re replacing a legacy product that is bulky, providing a free disposal service for the old unit can make saying yes easier. For B2B SaaS, perhaps making the integration free or one-click automated to the customer. You get the idea?
The more these non-price barriers disappear, the more customers will say yes.

In response to TechCrunch’s Equity Podcast: The Iron Rule of Founder Compensation is Dead.
During a recent drive around Austin, I couldn’t help but feel amused while listening to a recent episode of the Equity Podcast by TechCrunch titled The Iron Rule of Founder Compensation is Dead.
There seems to be a popular belief that the Venture Capital (VC) community is suffering from a lack of founders. The hosts also discussed a “huge theme of scared folks, due to the pandemic.”
As a VC in Texas, my world is dramatically different, and I wholeheartedly disagree.
Although COVID-19 has caused a lot of uncertainty and economic downfall, this is the reality of the entrepreneurial journey founders regularly face.
The supposed fact that there is “no deal flow” is completely nonsensical because people are still starting companies. They just don’t happen to be in the Valley.
Even as COVID rages, there are many more companies knocking on my door to choose from.
In Silicon Valley, founders usually have a strong plan B. If their startup fails, they’ll get hired by the tech company next door.
On the contrary, Texas founders are absolutely set on mission impossible. I don’t invest if the founder does not believe in their vision enough to quit their full-time job. I support and help them, but if the founder is not all in, why should I be?
Geographical boundaries have dropped. Founders now have access to VCs in their backyards, but also to those in New York City.
Normally, VCs do not want to travel far for early-stage investments, but now that the world is working remotely, what does it matter? The question is, is it a good time to explore outside of Sand Hill Road? I believe so.
My ask for the hosts of the Equity Podcast and the rest of the VC community is to look beyond the 94027 zip code. Texas houses talented, brilliant founders with world-changing startups.
I see plenty of good ones that make our decision process pleasantly difficult.
And it is a great problem to have. As VCs, we are in it for the long haul. We invest with an eye for an exit 8 to 10 years out. Would it be possible for you to assume that a portion of unicorns will emerge not from the saturated Silicon Valley, but from the hungry, determined Texans and Mid-Westerners?
A little reminder: some of the best companies started during recessions; notable examples include Google, Facebook, and Uber. In fact, starting a company right now is a recipe for the most motivated and gritty founders.
A recession has hidden benefits, one of which is the impetus to be very clear about who you are. It is also a ripe market for talent.
Startups have two options: strengthen their value propositions or die. Under most circumstances, a simple marketing campaign would find the first few fans, but today, clients in both enterprise and consumer-focused companies are demanding better and less expensive solutions.
At Sputnik, we strongly believe in consumer surplus: the idea that the difference between what you are willing to pay for something, and what you actually pay for it is a benefit to startups and their customers. Companies with a huge consumer surplus can certainly launch through crises. To learn more, read this article by my partner, Joe Merrill.
Have you thought about the world outside of the valley? It is emerging. It is dying for attention, and if you find that your pipeline is not good enough, come visit us in Austin post-COVID. We’d love to take you out for local, famous BBQ and introduce you to some great startups."

After talking to entrepreneurs over the past two weeks, it seems most businesses are imploding or exploding, depending on how well their business model can adapt to a post-corona virus world. There are five general things you can do now to make your business coronable: survive and thrive in a viral world.
If you have a physical good, start selling online, leveraging Amazon, Shopify, etc. to make it easier for people to buy what you have. Elite Sweets (https://elitedonut.com/) makes a gluten free, keto-friendly donut that is delicious and good for you. The perfect donut to survive the apocalypse, and available directly online. The small coffee shops that usually stock their product are closed, but no fear, you can still enjoy a guiltless pleasure, delivered to your doorstep. Heck, you can even get a free website from downloading the Leia app (https://heyleia.com/) and their powerful AI will build an ecommerce business for you! Consumers are shifting their buying online, move with them now.
If you are a service, start figuring out how to position your product for social distancing using online tools. ZenYala (http://zenyala.com/) is a software suite to manage meetings and make them more productive. When Corona hit, the founder, Jacob Bernstein, quickly realized that his software made virtual meetings even more productive, and because it is designed for results and accountability, was a better way to organize workflow for virtual teams than other products like Slack and Microsoft Teams. He quickly pivoted and created a new brand, ExecuMeetings (preview at http://execumeetings.tilda.ws/) and is aggressively selling to companies desperate to keep productivity high in a corona world. Kanthaka (https://mykanthaka.com/ and in your app store as Kanthaka) is a marketplace where individuals can find highly vetted and certified personal trainers and book them to come to their home. When corona hit, they had a surge in bookings as gyms closed; however, as the need to isolate became more obvious, Sylvia Kampshoff, founder and CEO, quickly added an option for trainers to do virtual sessions, and providing free group sessions called “Mommy and Me” for kids and parents to enjoy from home for free, further raising awareness of her brand.
If you are a local business owner, begin no-contact delivery (drop and go). If you’re blessed to live in the State of Texas, companies like Favor (https://favordelivery.com/), will find and deliver anything to your home. Local businesses can partner with Favor to deliver office supplies, hand sanitizer, and pretty much anything. Consumers can go to favor and ask for anything too, including toilet paper! For those of you who have to suffer living outside of Texas, you will need to hire and locate your own delivery people, or do it yourself. There are some new startups like GoShare (https://www.goshare.co/) that are last-mile delivery on demand and will do no contact delivery. Check who does delivery in your area, and bridge that last mile to the customer!
Learn to nano-target your customers with mobile ads. People will be spending a lot more time on their phones, so learn how to target your ad spend to effectively reach them. Companies like Datum (https://datumxy.com/) can specifically target individuals who are your customers or fit a very specific customer profile and make sure your ads only appear on their phones. For example, if you were a coffee shop owner, you could have Datum only target persons who visit coffee shops daily and live within a two mile radius of your shop. That highly targeted group would make a great audience to launch your new coffee by bike service, eh? The best part of nano-targeting is it’s FAR less expensive than buying bulk ads on Facebook, etc. The good news is that companies like Datum market across all app platforms, so they save you money and keep you in relevant digital locations for your customer base.
Get cash. We don’t know how long this will last, so make sure that you tap all your lines of credit, raise new equity, sell assets you don’t need, etc. and please do so now. Companies that weather storms are those that have adequate reserves to keep employees and suppliers paid so that your business can keep selling through the worst of times.
So, take a deep breath, you’ve got this. Remember, the best businesses in history were started in recessions/depressions. This is the time that heroes are made. Good luck out there, and please post any suggestions you have on becoming coranable in our comment section."

A conversation with four Texas MOMpreneurs on parenting while running a successful business
Being a mom is a full-time job. Entrepreneurship is a long, demanding journey, and few are brave enough to take on both, especially at the same time. We talked to four MOMpreneurs proving that it is possible. The Sputnik team was curious to know more about the demands of their hectic schedules and daily balancing act during this time. Between answering emails, switching between life and work, managing their team, hopping onto a Zoom meeting, virtual classes with the kids, and “me time,” how do these women do it all?
When the COVID-19 pandemic began, what was your initial reaction as a mom who will now be WFH with kids?
A kid runs in the background and yells, “Mom!"" but everybody that you work with is in the same boat, so it's just not as big a deal as you originally thought. Before, being interrupted might be embarrassing or considered unprofessional, but we’re all doing the best we can.
Could you describe one way you’ve busted the myth or stereotype of working moms?
There's a myth that working moms are fragile, burnt out, and at the end of the rope all the time. Certainly there are days that I feel like that, but it doesn't have to be that way. There's joy that I have in parenting and in being an entrepreneur. That joy spills from one to the other. So, rather than it being an either/or, I see them as complimentary.
What advice would you give to another mom who is only beginning her journey as an entrepreneur?
It's gonna take longer than you think, so drop those expectations. It's also going to be more rewarding than you think. The perseverance and hard work is deeper and harder than you would ever have thought, but then it pays off in ways that you didn't think of either so it's all worth it.
Any other thoughts you’d like to share about your experience tackling both motherhood and entrepreneurship?
Initially, I felt a little bit out of place as a mom and an entrepreneur because I thought of founders as young, twenty-somethings sleeping under their desks. It took time to find my own rhythm, and after getting through some preliminary doubts, I thought, ‘Wait a second, that's a stereotype that I had that's also not true.’ We can all be entrepreneurs. There's no age limit or status limit, whether you're single or married, mom or dad.
When the COVID-19 pandemic began, what was your initial reaction as a mom who will now be WFH with kids?
At first, I thought it wouldn't be doable working with the kids from home. It turned out that working from home with kids is totally possible. I work on tasks I really have to concentrate on early in the day when they’re still asleep. Most CEO tasks are perfectly doable with kids. I also live on a ranch, and before COVID-19, I lost a lot of time travelling and commuting. I am way more productive now working from home.
What advice would you give to another mom who is only beginning her journey as an entrepreneur?
Be prepared for a long journey and to work harder than you ever did. Hustle, hustle hustle and don't give up and you will be successful.
Any other thoughts you’d like to share about your experience tackling both motherhood and entrepreneurship?
Integrate your kids in the journey. Tell them about what you are doing. I want them to start their first venture as young as possible and see how fulfilling it is to be an entrepreneur. I am also happy my daughter knows women are fully capable of achieving great things.
When the COVID-19 pandemic began, what was your initial reaction as a mom who will now be WFH with kids?
I took over my daughter's room as my office. Everybody makes jokes about it, you know, like your child being your co-worker, but my daughter was more like a supervisor because she saw I was taking over her room. My desk was in there as well as products. Now she thinks it's her business too. We work together and she always wants to help.
How do you achieve a healthy parent/entrepreneur life balance? In your head, you tell yourself that you're doing okay. There are no guidelines or standards to follow to achieve a perfect balance. There's nothing out there that I can compare myself to because everybody's situation is so different. So I just tell myself, “It’s okay. I’m doing good.”
What advice would you give to another mom who is beginning her journey as an entrepreneur?
Incorporate your child. Make them feel included.
My daughter found a tea set in her room, and she said, “Mom, I want a tea party.”
I told her, “We can’t do that. Nobody can come over right now,” and she said, “No, they can come on your phone.” Then I realized she was right! So, we hosted a virtual tea and it ended up making television news.
We've also done Zoom storytime, and the Houston Mayor's daughter came on and read a book to the girls.
Any other thoughts you’d like to share about your experience tackling both motherhood and entrepreneurship?
As moms, we try to finish everything at once. You won't finish everything in one day. If it doesn’t happen right away, it’s okay. The pressure to take on an abundance of roles isn’t fair to you. Give yourself the gift of grace.
Alex Porter, Co founder and CEO of Mod Tech Labs
When the COVID-19 pandemic began, what was your initial reaction as a mom who will now be WFH with kids?
I always wanted to homeschool, and with my background as a nanny I was not too worried, however it didn’t work out as well as I had hoped. We have a 5 year old who was attending Kindergarten and more recently began after school care, plus a 3 year old who was attending full-time preschool. Our first day of the WFH effort included a final in-person class at Sputnik in downtown Austin with our kids in tow. It was an adventure in what I call “distract-ification”. How do you entertain and enrich little people while being productive? Our answer is a mix of crafts, devices with wholesome Netflix content, and all the snacks. The reality of the juggling act became apparent immediately. I was overwhelmed with the simultaneous demands from work and kids. My next step was to ask my partner to do shifts so that we could each have productive work times. This was a great early hack.
How do you achieve a healthy parent/entrepreneur life balance? I think in our case it is work-life fusion. Not only am I the CEO of the company and the mom of two kids, but their father is my co-founder and CTO. We do have some boundaries we have put in place to maintain sanity. Our big kid has to do some kind of schoolwork before she can watch any shows and we break up the day with time outside, other school tasks, crafts, and free play. We also try to stop work in the afternoon for a family walk and a workout. Afterward, we usually have family playtime and then dinner followed by the bedtime routine. Then Tim and I typically work for another couple of hours.
Any other thoughts you’d like to share about your experience tackling both motherhood and entrepreneurship?
Entrepreneurship is a game of high risk, high reward so think about your foundations and make sure they are strong. Be willing to sacrifice to-dos for your own well-being. You are your business for a long time and it cannot succeed if you are compromising your own values, time, self-care, etc. Talk to your kids about all of it. I make it a point to tell our kids that Mommy and Daddy are working on an important mission, and this is what gives us the means to provide for our family. If I am sad or exhausted, I tell them too. They are very empathetic little humans and they want to understand what is happening around them. Our family does its best to work together for the good of everyone and we all have to give and take."
33,https://www.sputnikatx.com/austin-startup-tips-blog/2020/5/22/blitzfailing-how-to-not-grow-a-company,"Blitzfailing: How to NOT Grow a Company
Some time around 2016, a company that was raising at a lofty valuation pitched to me requesting capital from one of Sputnik ATX’s antecedent funds. The company pitching was WeWork.
The heart of their presentation was a claim that WeWork represented a new model for coworking space that was going to revolutionize coworking from stodgy folks like Regus, a profitable competitor. At the time, WeWork charged less than Regus to use office space and WeWork had significantly higher unit operating costs, customer acquisition costs, higher churn, and a significantly riskier customer base.
I pointed out to their pitchman that they had lower unit revenue and far higher unit cost than their competitors. How could they make money?
They responded with more of the same balderdash. WeWork’s plan to overcome negative unit economics was to make it up on volume, as they grew faster and faster with additional investment.
Poppycock.
This reminds me of Paul McElroy in the old SNL skit, First Citywide Bank, who claims the bank makes it up on volume. Thus the old joke, ""I lose money on every one I sell, but I make it up on volume.""
If your marginal profit per unit sold is negative, no amount of volume will help you be profitable. Taking investment to accelerate losses makes the situation worse.
Blitzscaling is taking in large amounts of venture capital for massive customer acquisition growth in a short period of time. Growing so fast, you can’t be ignored, and then basking in the glow of a sustainable, massively profitable business.
A Blitzscalable business must have positive unit economics so that scaling increases profits, over and above overhead expenses and marketing costs. In short, the net profit selling each unit accrues faster than your expenses. When this happens, your company becomes profitable and sustainable.
Over the past few years large amounts of venture capital have poured into negative unit economic businesses that tout ""volume"" as the solution to their woes. Unless those businesses have some monopolistic plan to dominate the industry and then jack up prices to alter the unit economics, they will fail.
Of course, they could be hiding a novel new technology that will disrupt industry cost structure to make the unit economics positive, but if they did, why aren't they using that technology now?
For example, Uber analysts tout that the company may be profitable when driverless technology becomes broadly available. This begs the question why they’re just figuring that out now, after massive investment on a different thesis, but I digress.
Bottom line: when your unit economics are negative, the business is unsustainable and you are blitzfailing if you raise capital to dig your grave at an accelerated pace.
Instead, resourceful entrepreneurs should create disruptive innovation that dramatically lowers the cost to solve a customer's problem or provide a new, novel service that generates massive consumer surplus that cannot be ignored.
If you choose the path of the resourceful entrepreneur, unit economics and the market will reward you handsomely."

Ok, full disclosure, the headline is a smart quote from my fund partner, Oksana Malysheva, and, yeah, it is freakin' brilliant. Far too often, founders spend inordinate time talking to angels and VCs trying to convince them of their vision, commitment and results. The reality is, a good company, getting good traction, MUST find investors who share their ""gospel"" and understand what they're doing. The phrase, ""missionaries, not mercenaries,"" applies just as equally to early-stage investors as employees.
I just spoke with one of our companies. They have a $600k sales backlog that they'll complete this month, and about 50% or more of that will be recurring revenue. The product is a complex AI service in an industry vertical that is large and growing fast.
They had a call with an investor who basically questioned their revenue numbers because it seemed to him that they were just too high. How could a company only six months old have $600k in revenue this month? Didn't make sense to him that the industry vertical had revenue anywhere near their forecast. In short, he didn't know their industry economics, and instead of jumping at the opportunity to get in early with a VC backed company showing strong sales growth (epic growth, quite frankly), he sits like a stick in the mud.
What was Oksana's response? ""Don't waste time convincing skeptics."" Truth.
Many angels and VCs will not share your vision. You will not convince them otherwise. There are literally thousands of people who fund companies. If you're raising money, shift your efforts from convincing those who don't get it, to those who do. You're time is as valuable as the VC's time, even if it doesn't seem that way from how they treat you.
In fact, it could be argued that time is more valuable than money, especially at an early stage. Don't waste that precious asset on a road to nowhere. If a prospective investor doesn't get it, cut bait and move on fast. Politely let them know that it doesn't look like a good fit, and move on."

#JusticeForGeorgeFloyd is a call for our humanity to stand up and speak. ENOUGH!
I am not willing to live in a world where one man can take another man’s life by squeezing his last breath with his knee. I am not willing to leave this world to my kids.
Our collective humanity had been violated. The blatant violation of basic human rights is haunting. We have seen it before in the US, in Nazi Germany, in Bosnia, in Somalia.
One of my favorite quotes from MLK is, “Darkness can not drive out darkness, only love can do that. Hate can not drive out hate, only love can do that.”
This is a call for all of us to do whatever is necessary to be certain this never happens again. I am convinced that many police are good humans that would put their lives on the line to protect all civilians. But the systems in place must change.
Evil players should be expunged so that the unfair treatment of Black Americans and other people of color is eradicated for good. Black Americans should be able to see police as protection and not a threat to their lives if they make a wrong turn, speed up or go for a jog. Black Americans should have better access to quality education and employment opportunities. Black voices should be represented and amplified in the media, in the workplace and in the products we design.
As a Venture Capitalist, I have the opportunity to use my privilege to make a difference. I am convinced that businesses and technologies exist that consistently shed light on the current madness and consistently bring prosperity into our Black and Hispanic communities.
To support and elevate the trajectories of these businesses is just. It is time. It is also good business. As Oprah has said before, “Excellence is the best deterrent from racism and sexism.”
If your business is working to end police brutality or systemic racism, we at Sputnik ATX want to hear from you.
Thank you."

If you've read Joe's article on consumer surplus and why it matters, but you want more information on the math, you're in the right place.
When we review applications, we pay special attention to the question that asks how much consumer surplus your startup generates. It's one of the questions that really helps us determine whether we think you'll be a unicorn, and it is important to us that you've thought the question through, so don't overlook it if you're applying to Sputnik ATX!
In order to get started, you'll have to first research these two things and save your sources:
- The $ amount a customer is willing to pay. You can make an educated guess about this number based on competitors, the cost of the problem you are solving to your customer, and/or what their current solutions are to that problem.
- The # of customers in total addressable market
Here's how to do the actual calculation:
where A = $ amount a customer is willing to pay
B = $ amount a customer pays for your product
C = total addressable market (# of customers, not a dollar amount)
Once you find the answer, it's important to include your calculation + sources / assumptions that helped you arrive at the numbers for the amount the customer is willing to pay and the TAM, too."

Upon moving her family to Texas from Germany, high-powered attorney Dr. Slyvia Kampshoff searched for personal trainers nearby to continue her daily fitness routine in her new home.
“I couldn’t find anyone that wasn’t an intimidating, half-naked male,” Kampshoff jokes.
With a longtime passion for fitness and a tight schedule between kids and work, Kampshoff questioned why there wasn’t a convenient way to connect with personal trainers. Her husband, who found himself in a new city each week for work, disconnected from his fitness routine, wondered the same.
For a while, the couple settled for personal training at a gym, which made visits more difficult and less frequent. Then, the birth of their son was a turning point.
“When I was on maternity leave, I had a lot of time to reflect on what I really wanted,” Kampshoff said, ""and having a son changed my life so much already, so I decided, ‘Why not go for it?'”
After 8 years practicing law, Kampshoff left to make fitness accessible and convenient for all.
COVID Shocks The Industry
“We were in a lucky position when COVID-19 hit,” Kampshoff said. She remembers sitting in the office kitchen with Sputnik Managing Partner Oksana Malysheva, when Malysheva suggested she pivot to virtual training.
“Initially I pushed back but gave myself a day to think. The next week, our team implemented a video interaction feature,” Kampshoff said.
At first, clients were reluctant to try virtual training. Kampshoff led five virtual sessions weekly to share her experience and educate clients on the benefits of the virtual option.
Today, most of Kanthaka’s clients prefer virtual training because there’s a stronger sense of privacy. Plus, it’s half the price of in-person sessions.
Moving forward, Kampshoff says she’ll mostly do virtual sessions at home, too.
“It’s just so convenient,” Kampshoff said. “I don’t have to worry about tidying up, and I’m able to wake up at 5:55 am for my 6 am session.”
In December 2020, 30% of Kanthaka’s sessions were virtual with no ad-spend dedicated to virtual training. Kanthaka’s client-base also increased by 6X compared to 2019. And before COVID-19, only 10% of users were male. Today, men make up about 40% of Kanthaka’s total users.
Convenient Fitness Is Here to Stay
“Usually, people go to the parties, eat, travel, and wait until January 1st to start a healthier routine,” Kampshoff said, “but this time user behavior was different.”
Rather than the typical January spike, Kanthaka saw an explosion in December 2020 sessions after they launched a “Don’t wait til January 1st” campaign.
“I don’t think virtual will go away,” Kampshoff said when asked about where fitness is headed in the long term. “We just have to educate users,” she said.
According to Bloomberg, more than 350,000 fitness instructors and trainers in the U.S. saw in-person studio classes and personal training sessions dramatically shift for COVID. Now more than ever, users have been introduced to the idea of convenient fitness.
And Kampshoff isn’t stopping at personal training. She’s building an ecosystem around health by adding nutritionists to the platform as well as at-home equipment to sell with fitness packages.
Also in the books for 2021: improve the customer’s virtual experience by collaborating with video platforms to make fitness more accessible, and hit ambitions sales and virtual sessions goals."

We all know what happened in March of 2020. Austin, Texas was no exception. SXSW was canceled, leaving scores of commuters frustrated as the travel ban took effect. In that group of newly trapped travelers were Maryna Burushkina, her husband, and young son. They had no choice but to stay.
Although it was unexpected, Burushkina was no stranger to new environments. Originally from Ukraine, she spent seven years in Russia. Afterwards she chased her degree to the Netherlands where she kicked off a successful career. Her accomplishments led her from the tulip-lined canals of Western Europe all the way to Spain and even Germany in the span of 12 years.
Boasting over a decade of marketing experience from agencies, corporations, Fortune 500 companies, and most recently, tech startups, Maryna Burushkina is at the forefront of marketing automation through her innovative use of AI.
Solving The Marketer's Great Time Suck
Most Marketing Managers will agree on the pain points of strategic planning. It relentlessly sucks time, energy, and resources. As a Manager herself, Burushkina first-handedly experienced each meticulous minute.
“When you do this for 10 years every single month, there is a time when you think to yourself, ‘Ok, there must be a way to automate all of this,’” she said.
Months of research and conversations with fellow marketing colleagues and IT professionals gave Burushkina the assurance that she wasn’t alone. It’s no wonder that, in recent years, automation has surged in the marketing technology industry.
Development started in 2018. Burushkina and her team built a platform that generates personalized growth marketing plans with clear personas, customer journey mapping, and a data-driven growth strategy which is aptly called “Growth Channel”.
A year later she joined YCombinator Startup School where she learned how to launch fast. On top of that, she gained more user feedback from small business owners and startup founders.
“The problem was bigger than I thought,” Burushkina said. “I discovered that startup founders actually don’t know what to do with marketing or how to get started.”
With that in mind, she pivoted to serve a larger clientele of founders in need of expert marketing. The platform officially launched in July 2020 with a prototype that gained 20 initial users in the first week.
In August 2020, Growth Channel joined Sputnik ATX’s Summer 2020 cohort where she grew her userbase 20% weekly on average. By the end of the program in mid-November, the B2B SaaS platform had 104 qualified leads in their pipeline; in January, that pipeline grew to 27K and now it stands at 40K with over 1000 paid users.
What’s next for Growth Channel?
Recently, Burushkina identified that her users were using the platform once a month to refresh their marketing plans. And from her interactions with potential customers online, she realized that founders wanted more support.
“People love our product, but they use it only when they need to re-think their marketing plans. We want to be there for them weekly, daily basis,” Burushkina said.
Growth Channel is expanding on the experience part of their platform so that in addition to planning their marketing with AI, users can also activate and optimize campaigns efficiently through the platform.
By the end of 2021, users can expect to find a library within Growth Channel including marketing podcasts, tools, resources, experts, and execution help curated for founders and marketers.

In 2012, Bangladeshi computer science student Muhammad Mahdi received a call from an old high school friend, Arifin Hasan. A year ago they parted ways for college after having been friends for 7 years. Hasan wanted to meet up again.
As conversation began, they, like many college students, began fantasizing about building their dream companies. But the fuel driving their dream was a bit deeper than the usual “I want to be the next Elon Musk” declaration.
“Whenever you hear about Bangladesh you only see the bad news. Arifin and I discussed what we could do to change that,” Mahdi recounted.
Their vision began as “Life’s Carnival,” a software to help disillusioned employees find their true profession. But after 2 years, the business stagnated and the pair realized it was time for a change.
With Hasan’s background in fashion, an industry worth $22 billion dollars a year in their own backyard (making Bangladesh the second largest worldwide supplier), they found a market worth exploring. They just needed a pain point to solve.
Designing a Solution to Apparel Logistics
Mahdi and Hasan began calling every supplier who would give them the time of day until they met with over 200 companies and pinned three pain points that needed solving:
Number one was the language barrier. Buyers worldwide were struggling to connect with suppliers in Bangladesh as they relied entirely on ciphering translated emails.
Number two was transparency. There was no way to track orders from manufacturers other than email. Even designers sinking hundreds of thousands into their clothing lines had worse order tracking than their own customers
Number three was lack of responsibility. Whether a buyer would get their shipment in ten days, ten weeks, ten months, or ever depended on the trustworthiness of their contact in Bangladesh. Too many buyers were left hanging.
On a mission to obliterate all three pain points with tech, Nitex built a manufacturing and logistics platform that would enable anyone, anywhere to build their own clothing brand without any upfront cost and with all the resources of massive brands like H&M and Zara.
Hitting the Runway
For three years the company relied on revenue alone as skeptical investors failed to see their vision. Then in 2020 they applied to Sputnik ATX.
The Nitex team used Sputnik as a launchpad to grow and build credibility needed to convince future investors. Now the company boasts a global team and a 90% customer retention rate.
In the last two months Nitex onboarded BooHoo group from the UK, one the fastest growing online retailers in the fashion world, and Salling group, the biggest retailer in Denmark. And Nitex is currently growing at 11% week over week.
During the heaviest COVID months of 2020 Mahdi and Hasan went all in on investing in their team, supporting their development with English and university classes in marketing, communication, and product management. In the end, it injected new life into the company.
“COVID has been the best time for our company because we put a lot of focus on ourselves, radiating energy to our teams, the value we are creating for the brands, and on the product we are making,” Mahdi explained.

After one long trip across the Atlantic and seventy years working hard as a shoe salesman, Ben Mione found himself declaring bankruptcy. Never in his life was he offered the chance to invest in retirement. Sitting by his side in bankruptcy court was a professional investor, his son, Barry Mione.
“I thought I knew everything about investing,” Mione says. “But there I was, a professional money manager, sitting in bankruptcy court with my own dad.”
Now Mione is the CEO of SaveDay, which gives any small business the power to offer employees a 401(k) at no cost to the employer.
SaveDay’s goal is for no working American to worry about retirement ever again, allowing small businesses to grow in the process.
“My wife has a good friend who’s working in the construction industry -- the male dominated construction industry,” Mione says.
Offering her employees a 401k gave her business the edge it needed to be competitive in the world of construction debris removal. Many of SaveDay’s customers tell the same story, so much so that last week, SaveDay was recognized for the second time as the top 401k provider by Shortlister.
Addressing A Looming Crisis
Social security as we know it is set to run out by 2035. And compared to the 83% of baby boomers who rely on the program to be the primary source of income during retirement, less than half of millennials and only 38% of Gen Z plan on using Social Security for retirement.
New generations are looking for more options and Saveday is poised to meet that need. That’s why their monthly contributions are doubling annually and have over 5,000 contributors that come from all fifty states.
Savings For All
Saveday is the only 401(k) provider that charges $0 in fees, making it affordable to big name customers like Circle K and Papa Johns as well as small family businesses like Purple Fig Company, an Austin business which grew from 18 to over 45 employees since joining Saveday.
“All other companies in perpetuity are still stuck in the 80s in terms of what their pricing structure is,” Mione says, “but our technology is what makes onboarding so easy and cheap.”
The national activation rate for employees that opt into 401(k)s is 52%. Saveday’s rate is 62%, which the team attributes to their user-friendly, simple, $0 onboarding process."

There are literally a million things that can kill your startup. Worrying about all of them will likely drive you nuts, and distract you from the “holes” right in front of you. So with an eye on the hole right in front of you, let’s take a side eye to the five general categories of risk that can doom your start-up and how you can best avoid them: product risk, market risk, financial risk, team risk, and execution risk.
Product risk is what most early stage founders and investors most commonly fail to measure. It is best framed in the economic measure of consumer surplus (the gospel of which I am an avid disciple). Are you producing something people want because the cost of acquiring it is far less than the value it provides to the user? To answer this question, you’ll need to listen (yes, stop talking) to a LOT of customers. Ask them how they do things, observe how they solve their needs. Question the root cause of those needs. Seek first to understand them before you begin showing off your so-called solution. When you can make something they actually want really badly for a cost far below what they are willing to pay, you have product fit.
Market risks that can doom your startup are most often found in distribution problems, market size, and competition/substitutes. Even if you have a product with massive consumer surplus for a party of one, you’ll never have a massive business if the total size of the market is minuscule, you can’t find a channel to get it to market, or if there is a competing solution that is half your cost. Most companies die because they fail to solve market risk by building effective sales channels. Too often VCs cite a company with a lack of product-market fit when in reality, the company has a great product and zero marketing. To solve this, focus on how you can make purchase decisions easy: convenient location of sale, ease of technology, elegant UI, one-click buy, marketing channel exploration, CAC/LTV ratios, etc. This is why we advocate for maker-founders to seek out help from proven marketing and sales guru investors who put in money and time into your company rather than advisors who both those things out of your startup.
Financial risk becomes a problem when the fundamental costs of doing business generate insufficient returns to sustain your business. Some are short term, like making payroll next week if your runway is going away. Some are longer term, like high upfront capital costs from inventory or equipment required to make or distribute your product/service. The key here is to keep a tight lid on costs and try to get profitable as fast as you can. Avoid splurging on that fancy office when a shabby one will do just fine (and use the savings to add the additional sales person who will help resolve this problem). If your company has significant upfront costs, you’ll need to carefully manage inventory levels and development expenses so that you don’t run out of runway before you’re ready to take off. Too often I hear founders complain that their company failed because they couldn’t get funding, when really, they couldn’t find a way to develop the product and market fit with the resources they had, when it was entirely possible to do so. They just failed to have a financial plan to match their access to resources. Yes, it does take longer to build a company without funding from VCs, and yes, we often don’t understand what we’re doing. So if you’re the smart founder who does “get it”, live within your means to do so.
Team risk is why most seed stage companies with $50k-$100k MRR fail to raise their series A. No one is going to drop $3-5mm on a company that, if the founder is hit by a bus tomorrow, blows into dust with them. Nor will a VC put real money into a team that has only product skills. If you want money to scale, you need to show that you can build a team that is better than the founder and has complete skills (product, marketing, sales, customer support, and finance). This means you not only need a team, but a team that says, “we’ve got this”. Hire folks who’ve done it before or have such impeccable academic qualifications that their abilities are not in doubt. Hire away a key person from a HOT growth company who has experience with the growth challenges you face right in front of you (note: Google is not a hot growth company, it is a stale corporate machine).
Execution risk will be the subject of a post later this month, but to summarize it best, it is when you get to $3mm in annual revenue and think you’ve “made it” when really, you haven’t even started the real race yet. The ability of a company to grow quickly under pressure, hire the right people, put in place proper culture, incentives, and relationships so that the company can prosper and run full speed is far, far harder than anyone thinks. Execution risk is the killer of would-be unicorns and turns them into someone’e distressed asset purchase or family business. Your ability to create a culture of performance aligned with your customers needs and economic value model will be the key to getting things done as you scale. If this is your start-up, DM me, and we’ll talk further. A paragraph here just doesn’t do that sentence justice.
So, overall, start thinking about how you can de-risk your startup by looking at these risks and how your daily activities, weekly and monthly goals help eliminate them as best possible. You’ll never get rid of them, but you can sure sleep better at night if you do."

By: Oksana Malysheva
I’ve spent most of my career in spaces where I’m not supposed to be, from the lab to the boardroom. Perhaps there is some mischievous joy in crashing the party, because I ultimately ended up in one of the most notorious boys' clubs of all, Venture Capital.
Just going by the numbers, VC appears to be a private league for silver-spooned mansplainers where feminism doesn't come to mind.
Although these kinds of firms do exist, I see a different story in the colleagues I've worked with over my years in finance. The men I've worked with have been strong advocates for women who have made me feel supported and viewed as an equal. Yet to this day, when I look around I am clearly part of a gender minority.
How could a workplace so keen on equality be so pale and male?
I brought this question up with my daughter, who pointed me to a phenomenon that occurred in the Boston Symphony back in 1952.
The managers realized that a disproportionate amount of their instrumentalists were male. In a conscious effort to be more diverse, they implemented “blind auditions'' where each auditioner performed behind a screen. But in the end, results still skewed male.
Flummoxed, they tried one more idea -- making the auditioners take off their shoes. They were shocked when 50% of women made it past the first audition.
As it turns out, the sound of women’s shoes clicking against the floor signaled to the judges that the auditioner was female. Correcting for this allowed the judges to evaluate on performance alone – and led to a more equal orchestra.
The Boston Symphony was ahead of its time with its effort to remove sexism from their audition process, but despite their best intentions to equalize the orchestra, hearing a woman’s shoes triggered an unconscious bias in favor of male constituents. This tells us that fighting bias isn’t as easy as just wanting to do the right thing.
We all have inherent biases, but the good news is that by recognizing that they exist, we can craft systems to compensate for these predispositions rather than ignore them.
Venture capitalists have a special incentive to prioritize diversity - both ethically and for our wallet’s sake. Diverse teams outperform by serious margins, like being 36% more profitable, yet receive 43% less funding than homogeneous teams. Together we can be ethically interested in our bottom dollar and make conscious steps towards change.
Here’s the system that works at my firm.
1. The Questions You Ask Will Define the Answers You Get
Many hiring managers feel that unstructured, free-flowing interviews tend to be the most effective when screening candidates - but according to Harvard Business Review, this interview style is the worst predictor of actual job performance. According to the research, in unstructured interviews, hiring managers often favor candidates that look like themselves. This contributes to occupational gender segregation – i.e., male engineers hiring more male engineers and female nurses hiring more female nurses.
Screening companies as VCs is no different. A proven remedy to biases in the interviewing process is asking curated, pre-planned, consistent questions to every founder. At my firm, we screen startups with the exact same blind application. Thanks to that form, we know we’re getting the best of the best, free of our own biases.
2. Finding Founders Who Don’t Look Like You Gets Tricky If They’re Never On Your Calendar
If we are truly committed to making the world more diverse, we need to invest time in communities that are different from our own. The Latine AI whiz and Black code maestro are waiting for your attention - and if you never take the time to meet with them, you’ll never be on their radar when they come looking for investment partners.
When we discovered that Latin founders were underrepresented in our portfolio at Sputnik ATX, we made the decision to intentionally network in communities where these founders were present. We put in the work, and we got great applicants. Expanding your circle is the key to finding amazing talent.
3. For an Unbiased Future, Consider the Time You Must Invest Now Talent could always use a good mentor. If you take on a new mentee every year, consider what your business could look like in ten. I like to tell people to start “coaching their bench.” The players you take under your wing will be team captains one day.
Although much progress has been made, many firms are still ignoring, statistically, the world’s best talent. And it’s all because of implicit bias.
If you’re a firm looking for talent, this is great news for you - because now you know where to go find your next best hire. The secret to finding talented, high-potential startups is in building a “shoes off” type of future.
VCs don't need to ""focus"" on diversity; we need to open our eyes. Talented, diverse people are everywhere."

Is there anything worse than sorting through hoards of jeans looking for a pair that’s cute, fits, and matches your style? Personally, I waste hours in fitting rooms, scrounging for the perfect pair. The founder of Redenim, Kelly Ernst, tackled this problem with her company Redenim. She provided a personal interview about her experiences as a female Founder and the unique challenges she faced. It shed some light on why female founders receive such a small percentage of VC funds.
She said her largest obstacle was helping male VCs to understand how deep this problem runs for women.
“They just don’t get it,” she sighed.
Heidi Zak, co-founder of ThirdLove, a company designed to make buying bras quick, easy, and affordable (the second biggest problem facing women behind jeans), walked into a meeting with a venture capital firm with a similar problem. She had amazing metrics, skyrocketing growth, and a fantastic margin structure. She was confident that she would nail this pitch. Unfortunately, she was mistaken; the VCs just weren’t interested. At the end of the meeting one of them told her “Sorry, we only invest in things we understand.”
Yes, all this is frustrating and the numbers don’t lie. Just 17% of startups in the U.S. this year have at least one women founders. Not only that, just 3% of all venture capital goes to companies with all-female founders. Are VCs sexist pigs who will do anything to keep women out of business? I don’t think so (although there are some who are). Heidi Zak says the problem is that male VCs just aren’t passionate about female-targeted products.
So as a woman how do you break into this male-dominated industry? Heidi says the most important thing is that female founders support other female founders. Of course, this can’t replace venture capital; those checks are hard to beat. But other founders can provide feedback, mentoring, and networking opportunities. Another big problem with venture capital is that most VC and founder introductions come from “warm leads” where a friend or partner introduces the investor to the company. That means male founders have an advantage right off the bat.
The other problem is that there are few women in venture capital. Most women are at the associate or analyst level. VC firms need to promote women so that they have a seat at the table, and the firm benefits from the “no brainer” idea that diversity makes better investment decisions. You can’t teach a blind man color, so men need women at the table to tell them the value they can’t see.
There’s a lot of work to be done for women in business. Don’t get me wrong, there are women founders out there who are incredibly supportive of one another. If you are a woman with a business idea don’t be afraid to reach out. Work together. Succeed together. Find progressive VCs who understand this problem and work with women founders. Those percentages will go up.

It's All About Confidence.
Most of the time, I like men. And I hope we're beyond disputing the competency of women. We make up 57% of college students in America. We are half the workforce, and are closing in on middle management. Studies conducted by Goldman Sachs and Columbia University have found that companies who hire more women outperform their competitors on all measures of profitability. Its clear to see that society is moving in a female direction.
Yet for some annoying reason, men around us are promoted faster and are paid more. At the top of the business chain women are nearly absent, and the numbers are barely increasing. Despite what some may say, the numbers don't lie. It isn't all maternal instincts to balance work and home lives, or even a tyrannical board of men hellbent on keeping women from the top. It is a phenomenon The Atlantic likes to call ""The Confidence Gap"".
Claire Shipman and Katty Kay, the authors of Womenomics, which looks at the positive changes unolding for women in recent years, were shocked to find that accomplished women were being held back by something. They asked, ""Why did the successful investment banker mention to us that she didn't really deserve the big promotion she'd just got?""
The two women were intrigued and decided to delve further, talking to more highly successful women. They hoped to find examples of ""raw, flourishing female confidence."" As they looked more closely (even inside themselves) they realized that they couldn't find a single woman who wasn't plagued by self-doubt. There was no tyrannical board of men holding women hostage on the dark side of the wage gap.
The biggest crisis for women is a vast ""confidence gap"". Compared with men, women don't believe they are worthy for promotions. They predicted that they'd do worse on tests, and in general underestimate their abilities.
The journalists and authors dug even deeper into this phenomenon. It turns out, success correlates just as closely with confidence as competence. It makes sense why women are underrepresented in the highest business levels. The good news is that confidence doesn't just come from nowhere. It can be acquired through work. The confidence gap can be closed.
Linda Babcock, a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University, found that men initiate salary negotiations four times as often as women do. Not only that, when women do negotiate, they ask for 30% less than men do. It statistically rings true that men overestimate their abilities while women underestimate them. It also was found that women applied for promotions when they were 100% qualified. Men applied when they were only 50%.
The evidence is all here, ladies. We need to stop overthinking and just act. Neuroscientists tell us everyday how versatile our brains are. We can change our pattern of thinking. If we keep working hard, we make our brains more confidence prone.
So, ladies, what should we do to develop more confidence and fill the gap? I'm not one to talk without action, and no woman should be. There are plenty of concrete ways to increase confidence. Here are a few. First, visualize. This is a technique of seeing an image of yourself that you are proud of in your mind. Low confidence comes from a poor perception of ourselves (an inaccurate perception). Don't hold back! Visualize an incredible version of yourself achieving your goals.
Second, do one thing that scares you every day. Good news about your insecurities: everyone else has them too. The best way to face fear is to stop procrastinating and face it. By proving to yourself you that you can do things that scare you, your self-confidence blossoms. Go out of your comfort zone! What good has sitting still ever done you?
Third, question your inner critic. No one spends as much time with us as ourselves. That means we are present for every little mistake. But Louise L. Hay, bestselling author, put it best ""You have been criticizing yourself for years, and it hasn't worked. Try approving of yourself and see what happens."" Find moments to congratulate yourself! Look for evidence that proves your inner critic wrong.
Fourth, help someone else. I know. It seems contradictory. Why should I help someone else when I'm the one who needs help? Psychologists show that helping others enables us to forget about ourselves. Gratitude for what we have is essential for both happiness and confidence and doesn't it feel good when you make a difference for someone else?
Fifth is to care for yourself. Good physical, emotional, and social health are so important and often glossed over. It's hard to have confidence when you hate your physique and are starved for energy. Make an exercise plan, revamp your sleeping habits, and dress the way you want to feel.
If this seems daunting, just choose one or two for now. You'll be surprised at the difference in how you feel after completing even one of these tasks. If you don't feel confident, follow renowned psychologist Amy Cuddy's words ""Fake it until you become it."""

We’re adding more follow-on funding, and here’s how our interview process and classes will look during the pandemic.
Oksana and I had more than just a few meetings in the past few months to discuss how the current pandemic will change investing in early stage companies, and how we can adapt to help companies be safe, and grow through hard times.
So, we're announcing today that we're open for our next cohort applications, and have a couple of things you should know:
It is very likely that our next cohort will meet virtually, at least to get started, and we'll see how it goes. Most of our work can be done remotely, and we don't want to risk it if things are still dodgy.
Interviews will still be in person, but at a distance, and likely outdoors. This will mean modifying how we interview. You'll definitely be 20 feet away from us (so get good at projecting your voice), and we will all have masks. With sun shining and a breeze flowing, no need for anyone to take risks on this, but we still want to see who we're investing in, at a significant distance. And please, don't come close to us, not because you stink or anything like that, safety first.
Our new SAFE note has two key changes. First, we've increased our option to invest up to $500k in your company from $350k where it was earlier. This reflects the need to pump additional capital into our most promising alumni who need growth capital due to epic demand, and the expectation that many angel investors are limiting new investment. Second, the option period is now 18 months, to ensure that if you hit your growth period after graduation, we've still got your back. We've already seen graduates from even a year ago coming back when they hit their stride, and we'd like to make that refunding easy.
More than anything, we strongly believe that this shall pass. It is hard but we know the dawn is coming, and we firmly believe that there is a bright future for humanity and the Texas start-up community.

73,https://www.sputnikatx.com/austin-startup-tips-blog/top-10-tips-how-to-build-a-pitch-deck,"Top 10 Tips: How to Build a Pitch Deck
A pitch deck can make or break you and your startup’s ability to get funding, but making a good pitch deck is easier than you might think. Two things you have to remember are that you are telling a story and you have to keep it as simple and visual as possible.
If you still do not have a completed product, you can read more about how to develop one effectively here. Go ahead I’ll wait; good product development will help you in developing your deck.
Now, follow these steps on how to design each of your slides and you will be well on your way to telling a great story. At the end of this article, you'll find more resources for building great decks as well as a Cards-Against-Humanity-esque pitch deck game.
1. Cover
This will be the first thing people see and can be either the easiest or hardest slide for you. Its components are simple, but meaningful: name, logo, and tagline.
Your tagline should be a short and simple 5 to 7-word sentence that can summarize what your startup does in an impactful and memorable way. Your audience should be able to generally understand what your company does with just this slide.
2. Problem.
Before talking about what you do, establish why you do it. Create a connection with the audience. Make three simple problem statements, and highlight your key words/phrases. Someone skimming your slide should be able to clearly see the problems you are addressing summarized in those three key words/phrases.
3. Solution.
Now this is your time to shine! After stating your problems and all hope seems lost, you come in and show how you are the solution. Summarize your solution into three key words/phrases, your core value propositions. Talk about the benefits, not the features of your offering. No one wants to invest in features.
3. Market Validation.
Data is key. Show investors that people would actually purchase your product/service. Reference a company in your space, or similar space, to give investors a real idea of your market opportunity. Do not be afraid to utilize the success of your competitors to your advantage.
4. Market Size.
Data is still key. Alright, so people will use your product. Now how many of these people are there? Show the size of your opportunity and provide third party proof of this. Go further and project and/or report your success so far.
5. Product.
Seeing is believing. Finally, show and tell investors what you do. Reserve this slide for your core functionality not all functionality. Keep it simple, define what you do in 3 to 4-words (if any at all) and utilize pictures and graphics. Show customer experiences, the market, the users, the platform, etc.
6. Business Model.
This is what it all comes down to. Simplify and summarize how you make money and how your company creates value into a single line. Go even further and touch on the potential your company has in the future by providing a simple projection.
7. Adoption Strategy.
How are you getting to your customers? Summarize 2 to 3 core customer acquisition strategies (utilize your key partners). Ultimately, this needs to be better, more scalable, and more profitable than your competitors.
8. Competition.
Where do you stand against competitors? Use visuals! Create a 2-axis diagram to define the two core differentiators of your startup, and use this to compare against competition. This keeps the focus on you and can show how you are literally on top.
9. Team.
This is where you show off those pretty faces. Keep your team slide to only your founding members and focus on their competencies and experience more than education and titles. An investor wants to be able to see that you are competent and experienced, not just well educated.
10. Ask.
What do you need? If you ask for money, have financials and a timeframe to support what you are asking for and why. You could, and should, also ask for mentorship, board members, advisors, business connections, and/or anything else that they could potentially provide you with.
At the end of the day, how you decide to present your company is all on you. None of this is set in stone. Except, if you follow this, then you should not have any problems.
Just remember, tell your story, keep it simple, and know it well.

77,https://www.sputnikatx.com/documents-accelerator-incubator,"application Documents
There are only two standardized documents you'll need to upload when applying, both are below.
THE SAFE Note
The idea of the SAFE note comes from the YC funding model. YC is a great accelerator program, and their note was originally developed to avoid wasting time negotiating valuation when funding large groups of companies in cohorts.
Our SAFE note (which is similar to YC’s in some ways) enables us to focus on adding real value to what you do, and we agree to figure out the value later when you raise additional funds in your next formal funding round.
The executed (filled out and signed) SAFE is required to be considered for the Sputnik ATX program. Please upload it with your application before you submit it. More on that here.
IMPORTANT FAQ :
The Discount: The SAFE document below states that the ""discount rate"" is 70%. To persons unfamiliar with legal documents and their particularly indecipherable vernacular, this appears at first blush to be bait and switch on the stated 30% discount rate. However; please make sure to read the definition in the document of ""discount price"" and how it is calculated. The discount price is: 70% X the Standard Preferred Stock sold in Equity Financing. Basically, it says 70% because that is the multiplier needed to end up with a 30% discount.
Please Note: The SAFE includes a valuation cap as well, and our option to add additional funding.
Click below to download the SAFE document if you are applying to the main program, with $100,000 funding. See requirements for applying to the main program here.
Business Plan
When applying, please include a copy of your business plan formatted using our standard template. Please keep it simple, and follow the guidelines in the template. We give points for brevity, so please keep this simple and to the point."

Special thanks to our sponsors, Sputnik ATX and Carroll Counsel!
About Kerry Rupp:
Kerry Rupp is General Partner at True Wealth Ventures. The True Wealth Ventures investment thesis is that women-led companies perform better financially, yet are an untapped market for investors since only 3% of venture dollars go to women-led start-ups and 15% to those with a woman on the leadership team. In addition, since women make 85% of consumer purchase decisions and 80% of healthcare decisions, True Wealth Ventures believes there are additional advantages for companies with women on the management team in designing products for, selling to and servicing these women customers in these markets.
For over 20 years, Kerry Rupp has launched, developed and grown startup companies and new lines of business for established firms.
As CEO and General Partner at DreamIt, a Top Ten US startup accelerator and early-stage venture fund, Kerry was directly involved with the launch of over 150 companies. During her 5-year tenure with DreamIt, she grew its programs to five cities, raised a $20M follow-on fund, and initiated the DreamIt Access (minority entrepreneur), DreamIt Athena (female entrepreneur), and DreamIt Health programs. DreamIt companies in aggregate now have a market value of over $1B.
Before DreamIt, Kerry was herself the founder of an online travel service, Holiday Golightly, which organized unique group travel excursions for women. She has also advised senior executives at Allrecipes.com, ReadersDigest, LexisNexis, Payscale, and Taleo on strategy, business development and marketing. Kerry began her career as a consultant with McKinsey and Andersen Consulting (now Accenture). In addition to consulting, Kerry serves as a mentor at Capital Factory and International Accelerator and on the advisory board of Medical Innovation Labs, a platform for commercializing innovations in the medical device field.
Kerry holds an MBA from Harvard Business School and a BA in Biology from Duke University. Kerry volunteers on the leadership teams of Women@Austin, The Angel Forum, and the Austin chapters of Harvard Business School Alumni Club, Harvard Business School Alumni Angels and the DukeGEN Global Entrepreneurship Network. Kerry is also a judge or coach on many local and national start-up competitions (e.g., athenahealth, Harvard Business School, Rice University Business Plan Competition, TiE Texas, Energizing Health Houston, Texas Venture Labs, AARP Health Innovation). She is also a nationally-certified instructor for the National Science Foundation’s Innovations Corps (I-Corps) program. Kerry is also an avid adventurer that has visited over 50 countries and 49 US states.

Communication is key in startups, from co-founder relationships to team management to investor relations; design mindsets and methods can help you become a better collaborator in your startup team.
Learn how to explain and comprehend ideas visually using design-thinking with Gray Garmon, Director of Integrated Design and Creative Technologies at the University of Texas at Austin.
In this Lunch and Learn workshop, we will discuss and practice three methods from Human-Centered Design that focus on active listening, sensemaking, and sketching. This will be a hands-on and collaborative session.
Gray Garmon is an Assistant Professor and Director of the Center for Integrated Design in the School of Design and Creative Technologies at the University of Texas in Austin. Before UT, Garmon was a faculty member at Southern Methodist University and co-founder of the Master of Arts in Design and Innovation program. He practices human-centered design (HCD): a problem-solving approach widely used in industry, governments, schools and NGOs. HCD focuses on people first. Through specific qualitative research methods, he comes to understand the context in which people are functioning and how understanding behaviors, emotions and motivations can lead to better design solutions.
Garmon holds a Master of Architecture from the University of Pennsylvania and a Bachelor of Science of Architectural Studies from the University of Texas in Austin. Garmon served in Peace Corps Ghana from 2007-2009, is a recipient of the American Institute of Architects Henry Adams Medal, and a University of Pennsylvania Social Impact Fellow.

Marketing for startups is life or death. You can have the best technology in your market, but if you're not telling the right story to the right audience, you're dead to the world and will have no customers.
Yet, when developing a marketing strategy and building a team to effectively execute (another favorite Chuck Norris word), founders often find that they're strapped for time and resources. What marketing initiatives are the most important for a startup? What is the right balance for young companies between building in house and outsourcing? How can I supercharge this for maximum impact, Chuck Norris style? Remember, Chuck Norris doesn't need social media, he's already following YOU!
In that vein of taking your marketing up to level 10, learn how one supernova AI startup in Texas catapulted from a 10-person, boot-strapping team to 7500% YoY sales growth and a 250X increased valuation in just four years. Yeah, Chuck Norris Texas Ranger style! With Spark Cognition VP of Marketing and Communications, John King.
SparkCognition leverages data to make customers' teams more effective, and their machines more reliable, resilient, and secure. The company works with global enterprise organizations in critical industries and is committed to building AI technology to advance the most important interests of society.
Joining in a sales and marketing role as one of the first ten people at SparkCognition, John successfully built the company’s marketing and communications organization, contributing to SparkCognition’s 7500% YoY sales growth from 2015-2019, and a 250X increased valuation over that same time period. Now a recognized global AI leader, John oversees SparkCognition’s marketing and communications strategy, setting the vision and priorities for the team, and driving alignment with sales, customer success, and product.
Under John’s leadership, SparkCognition's in-house communications team has earned recognition from dozens of global technology and business awards such as CNBC’s Top 20 Disruptor of 2017, Wall Street Journal’s 2018 Top 25 Tech Companies to Watch (#9), CB Insights AI 100 list for three years in a row, SXSW’s Hottest Startup (2X), TechFlash Titans, Nokia’s Global Open Innovation Challenge, Venture Beat, Red Herring, and many more. John’s team has acquired earned media from hundreds of national and global outlets such as Inc., Fast Company, WSJ, Financial Times, Reuters, Axios, Forbes, Fortune, Gartner, as well as local and industry publications."

AUSTIN, TX – January 31, 2020 – Sputnik ATX, an Austin startup accelerator focused on growth companies, today announced the selection of its Winter 2020 cohort, the fifth cohort of startup companies funded and mentored since Sputnik ATX launched in 2017. Each startup in this newest cohort serves a different industry, ranging from wellness and pharmaceuticals to STEM education and animation. However like each of Sputnik's cohorts to date, these latest companies share a common thread in that they solve a real problem in their particular marketplace.
“There were over 700 companies that started this application process,” said Oksana Malysheva, CEO & Managing Partner of Sputnik ATX. “The five that we have selected to invest in are those who are tackling big problems in their markets and making a difference in the world.”
Of the companies that attempted applications this round, four startups were chosen for Sputnik’s Winter 2020 cohort and one student-led startup was chosen for Sputnik’s Entrepreneur In Residence (EIR) Program, a result of Sputnik’s partnership with the University of Texas at Austin. Semi-finalists applied from all over the world including Macedonia, India, Denmark, France, Peru, and Puerto Rico.
The Winter 2020 cohort companies include:

At the end of the program cohort companies participate in a Demo Day where they present to a panel of investors. The next application round will open in April or May of 2020. To be eligible to apply startups are required to have a viable product, have at least one paying customer, and be located within a 300-mile radius of Austin or willing to relocate if accepted.
About Sputnik ATX
Sputnik ATX is an accelerator in Austin, TX that combines capital with training and experience to prepare seed-stage businesses for future rounds of funding. Their formula:
(Nerds + Investment + Training + Mentoring) Community = Success)
Sputnik ATX was named after the first satellite to enter Earth’s orbit, an event that touched off a new era of innovation and competition that still influences the world today. The Russian word ‘Sputnik’ translates to ‘partner,’ which describes this accelerator’s intention: to partner with and mentor chosen startups. The accelerator was born out of a venture fund founded by Dr. Oksana Malysheva and Joe Merrill. After investing in companies around the world, the entrepreneurial atmosphere of Austin inspired Malysheva and Merrill to consider the city as a new home for their efforts. Sputnik ATX launched on Oct. 4, 2017, the 60th anniversary of the Sputnik-1 satellite launch."

Six Startups Selected from Global Applicant Pool for Venture Accelerator’s 10th Cohort
AUSTIN, Texas – August 11th, 2022 - Sputnik ATX, an Austin, Texas based venture capital fund that backs early-stage, high-growth startups through a unique accelerator program, announced the selection of its newest program cohort for Summer 2022.
Hailing from Australia, Peru, Mexico, and across the United States, the six Summer 2022 program participants, selected from over 900 applicants, mark Sputnik ATX’s tenth cohort of startup companies since its founding in 2017. Sputnik ATX selects fewer than 1% of applicants each cohort, and over 4,000 innovative startups have applied to the program since inception. The select few that are chosen participate in the 13-week, Austin-based intensive accelerator program, which focuses on teaching startups how to sell and gain traction fast. Now with a portfolio of over 50 companies, Sputnik ATX’s investments span multiple industries including fintech, consumer products, software/SaaS and blockchain technology.
“Sputnik ATX has become a global destination for young companies with high-growth potential,” said Oksana Malysheva, Managing Partner and Co-Founder of Sputnik ATX. “We specialize in finding unicorn-potential businesses and helping them develop and scale, and both participating founders and future investors know that our model creates an irreplaceable foundation for future success. In contrast to other accelerator programs, savvy founders know that our program provides hands-on learning focused on sales, with the benefits of Silicon Valley veterans in the creative, tech talent-heavy Austin startup ecosystem.”
Malysheva continued, “Our founders are gritty, smart people who are all tackling problems that they personally experienced and want to fix for the large markets behind them. We’re here to teach them the secret handshakes of startups and VC and guide them to their startups’ highest potential.”
The Austin-based VC typically makes the first investment into their portfolio companies, with each startup receiving a $100,000 pre-seed investment from Sputnik ATX with opportunities for follow-on funding up to $400,000 more. Sputnik ATX alumni have subsequently garnered follow-on funding from the top VC funds globally, including Andreessen Horowitz, Softbank, Kleiner Perkins, Moonshots, Shasta Ventures, Draper Associates, and many more.
“We invest in startups in large markets that deliver dramatic changes in cost and/or productivity to the consumer,” said Joe Merrill, General Partner at Sputnik ATX. “We’ve noticed over the last 5 years that when you objectively look for quality and the highest potential for growth, you end up with a portfolio of diverse talent doing economic and social good with exceptional returns to investors. Sputnik ATX is a top decile VC fund and despite the market downturn, our founders continue to build the next generation of billion-dollar startup success stories while actively working to solve some of the world’s biggest problems.”
The six Summer 2022 cohort companies are:
With global warming on the rise, the number of carbon offsets sold has doubled in the past two years and is expected to grow 18X by 2030. The Savimbo Project works with tropical farmers to preserve and earn extra income from their land while helping corporations meet requirements to offset their carbon emissions. Started by 2X founder Dr. Drea Burbank, Savimbo creates fair trade carbon offsets, then validates, bundles, sells and securitizes them internationally for shared profits. Farmers received shared profits from carbon credits tracked on the blockchain, allowing them to participate in the $260 billion carbon-credit market with no middlemen.
Of the trillions of customer-employee conversations that take place daily at regulated firms, each carries a risk of being fined, on average, $10 million for non-compliance, creating a multi-billion-dollar problem. Cognitive View monitors customer-employee interactions over video, voice and written content with AI to help firms meet compliance, reduce risk and improve customer experience. Cognitive View’s founder, Dilip Mohapatra, previously built products for cybersecurity startups and advised Fortune 500 companies on application security & identity governance. The company has won numerous global awards, including Regtech 100, Fintech 100, IBM Beacon and more.
M Aerospace Juan Carlos Munguia, Austin, TX | Jose Comparan and Arturo Reyes, Mexicali, Baja California Mexico
The traditional manufacturing process of industrial metal is a notoriously expensive and lengthy process. 3D metal printers have the potential to make metal manufacturing far easier, yet no cost effective solutions exist for industrial applications. M Aerospace’s team (previously at Honeywell, Safran and Collins Aerospace) has created the world’s first affordable large scale metal 3D printer. Their beachhead product, the Armdust 2.0, makes large metal parts cheaper and faster with the same or higher quality compared to parts made using traditional methods. The Armdust 2.0 can be placed on-site to make parts on-demand, eliminating supply chain and shipping constraints.
Finding out-of-pocket cost estimates for medical services on the phone wastes time for both medical and insurance providers, and often doesn’t even produce accurate information for patients. With Brightpay, medical providers can quickly check insurance eligibility in real-time and proactively inform patients of their out-of-pocket financial responsibility before their service. Patients can either pay the provider directly through Brightpay’s platform or request financing. The founding team at Brightpay Health comes from deep experience in both healthcare and insurance, with multiple startups and 3 successful exits under their belt.
In the era of the Great Reshuffle, companies are focused on strategies to attract and retain top talent. Employee volunteer programs are an effective strategy in helping employees feel more connected to each other and to their company values. Founded by experienced founder Brooke Waupsh, Swoovy makes it easy for companies to book volunteer events, connect colleagues through shared interests, and track impact while reducing turnover and achieving higher profitability.
As companies spend time and money recruiting new tech hires, the talent they’re looking for might be on-site already. Silabuz helps companies see the potential in their existing employees and upskill tech talent to meet their needs. With Silabuz’s skill testing and upskilling solutions, companies can reduce turnover while saving up to 70% on recruiting and retention. In turn, tech job seekers without access to traditional higher education are elevated to higher career trajectories.

Five revolutionary startups are relocating to Austin,Texas to join Sputnik ATX’s 11th cohort from record-breaking global applicant pool
AUSTIN, Texas – February 23, 2023 - Sputnik ATX, an Austin,Texas based venture capital firm that backs early-stage, high-growth startups through a unique accelerator program, today announced the selection of the newest startup cohort for Winter 2023.
Selected from a record-breaking 1,200 applicants, Sputnik ATX’s eleventh cohort of startup companies showcases a mix of strong international and at-home talent, with founders from Dubai, Panama, and across the U.S. These five startups will participate in Sputnik ATX’s intensive 13-week accelerator program designed to fast-track sales, growth and development.
“Sputnik ATX invests with a firm belief that talent can come from anywhere. But, running a startup doesn’t come naturally to most. In a startup you’re on a mission to change the world at warp speed, which forces you to re-examine what you might have been taught about business,” said Oksana Malysheva, Founder and Managing Partner at Sputnik ATX. “That's where we come in. We find the best ‘nerds’ with incredible ideas, and we teach them how to sell and scale.”
With a rigorous, unbiased selection process that looks for founders with big ideas and a drive to change the world, the Austin-based VC invests in fewer than 1% of startups that apply to the accelerator program. Over 5,000 companies have applied to participate in the accelerator, and Sputnik ATX’s portfolio now has more than 60 companies across multiple sectors including fintech, consumer products, software/SaaS and blockchain technology, with strong representation from Black, female and LGBTQ+ founders.
“Venture capital can work as a revolutionary force to change the world around us, so we look for startup founders that are looking to solve big, global problems,” said Joe Merrill, Founder and General Partner at Sputnik ATX. “This year’s cohort hails from all corners of the globe - but each startup tackles a unique issue with both international and local impact. We can’t wait to see how these companies and founders grow, learn and flourish over the next few months.”
Sputnik ATX typically makes the first investment into their portfolio companies, providing a $100,000 pre-seed investment with opportunities for additional follow-on funding up to $400,000. Program alumni have gone on to receive funding from the top global VC funds, including Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Softbank, Shasta Ventures, and many more.
The five Winter 2023 cohort companies are:

Mystro’s real-time analytics and data transparency can transform and improve how leaders evaluate and manage organizations and projects of all sizes and scopes.
Sebastian Hilaire grew up playing soccer in Panama, and the former D1 soccer player knows why the best players in the world haven’t been discovered yet - they don’t have the network, resources and opportunities to get recruited. Prospect1 aims to fix this by equalizing the playing field, providing an athletic management platform that bridges the gap between talent and resources for young athletes in underserved countries through a data-driven development plan. Giving young, talented athletes the access and training to connect with next-level, professional opportunities offers the chance at better lives for themselves and their communities.
With online businesses receiving more and more sensitive data every day from their customers, business owners can’t afford to take chances with cross-border privacy compliance regulations - but these rules are often cumbersome and difficult to work with. During his time as a top developer at PayPal, Nara Pappu learned that mid-market and small businesses are at particular risk - so he created Zendata to bring automated data risk management tools to companies of all sizes. By eliminating the need for clunky manual processes and expensive audits, Zendata allows businesses to build trust with their customers and easily ensure compliance with laws across multiple jurisdictions automatically.
Applications for the next cohort will open this Spring. A complete list of Sputnik’s portfolio of investments to date can be found here.

By Stephen P. Schmidt
February 24, 2023
A Louisville-based startup focused on creating large group chats has something to talk about.
Yornest has been accepted into the highly selective Sputnik ATX’s 13-week accelerator program.
In doing so, Yornest was also able to close out its pre-seed round of $500,000 with $100,000 for getting into Sputnik ATX, which is a venture-based capital firm stationed in Austin, Texas. Before this announcement, the only other similar program that Yornest had taken part in was Louisville's Vogt Awards in 2021.
The company, co-founded by Michael Brizendine, was just one of five startups selected for the winter cohort out of a pool of 1200 applicants, a record for the program in its 11th iteration. The accelerator program “combines early-stage investment with training and mentorship focused on high growth and product-market fit,” according to a release. It should also be noted that out of the five selectees, only three are from the U.S.
In May we reported that Yornest had raised more than $100,000 through WeFunder in less than a month, with the total number ending at $103,150 from 34 investors. In addition, we reported at that time that its largest investor was KeyHorse Capital with $50,000, with contributions from Render Capital ($20,000) and Garrett French as well.
Built to address the capacity issues of other platforms in the group chat space, Yornest first launched in 2020 with an iOS version, and then later released an Android version in 2021, when Assistant Managing Editor Haley Cawthon first wrote about the company.
“We are reimagining the scalability of group chats for large communities and organizations,” Brizendine told me, adding that it is a misnomer that his app is a social media platform.
“You can be in a group chat of a million people and it's exactly like you are in a group chat with just your family. It’s designed to work that way.”
Brizendine, who also serves as Yornest’s chief product officer, told me recently that his platform had approximately 6,000 users and that the platform had an average of 500 messages being sent a day.
The timing of the announcement is fortuitous given that South by Southwest is taking place March 10-19 in Austin. Brizendine said he is going to attempt to be a part of the action by helping people start group chats about when and where unofficial events will be happening around the festival through what he termed “guerilla marketing.”
“One of the great features Yornest is a social calendar that’s attached to the groups,” he said. “And part of what we are trying to do is find the leaders of those unofficial events that will be hosting — on Yornest —and then therefore create an opportunity for growth in that community.”
First time in the States
Yornest was also named as one of our Startups to Watch back in late January. A day before attending the event on Jan. 31, Brizendine met his co-founder, Shaquile Noor, for the first time. It was also the first time Noor — whom Brizendine had initially met online in 2020 through a mutual friend — had been to the U.S.
When they met, Brizendine was in the middle of completing his computer engineering degree at Bellarmine University, which he finished in 2022.
At the event, Noor told me that before the news broke that they had officially been accepted into the Austin accelerator on Jan. 23, his trip was already planned.
“I was ready to just hustle and grind from the streets pretty much, so the fact that we landed this thing in Austin means … a lot of difference in basically everything,” said Noor, who also mentioned that he and Brizendine will have access to a team of “dedicated sales experts” into attention to the “potential breakout events” like South by Southwest and other networking opportunities in Austin.
“All of this stuff is going to go [into] shaping what our next steps are, so that's super exciting,” Noor added.
Eventually, Noor will be making his way to live in the U.S., so they can continue to build the company.
Brizendine — who has been visiting college campuses across the country trying to make inroads with student populations — said that exchange of tickets to college athletic events among students and the fraternity/sorority communities will be two major focal points going forward."

Sputnik ATX Announces Its Summer 2020 Cohort Companies Sputnik’s Most Diverse and Competitive Cohort to Date
AUSTIN, TX – August 27, 2020 – Sputnik ATX, an Austin startup accelerator focused on growth companies, today announced the selection of its summer 2020 cohort. The cohort consists of startups that are poised to solve a multitude of business and societal problems, including two companies with missions related to racial equality. Out of more than 1,100 companies that started the application process, Sputnik ATX chose the companies that showed the greatest potential for rapid growth and unicorn status -- reaching a valuation of over $1 billion. Of note, all seven companies are led by founders of underrepresented genders and ethnicities.
“Even during the pandemic we received a record breaking number of applicants this round,” said Oksana Malyhseva, CEO and Managing Partner of Sputnik ATX. “As a result, we had our work cut out for us in picking the best companies. This group of founders not only has unicorn potential but is also our most diverse cohort to date, asserting that talent can and does come from anywhere.”
This selection marks Sputnik’s sixth cohort of startup companies since its founding in 2017. The Summer 2020 cohort companies are:
- Check will end thousands of senseless deaths during traffic stops. This app facilitates safe interactions between police and motorists over mobile devices, protecting historically discriminated minorities and officers alike, taking stress out of the traffic stop for all.
- Fundr produces high performing seed portfolios of diverse founders for investors by taking bias out of the investment process via its highly evolved AI platform. Fundr also helps founders and investors with monthly reports, chat rooms and shared dashboards.
- Growth Channel uses AI to generate affordable digital marketing plans that outperform costly work from top agencies, providing SMBs data-driven, detailed tactical recommendations and strategies that were previously only affordable to big business.
- InstaCEI moves highway and horizontal construction project data into the digital age helping engineers and field staff immediately share data, moving mountains of manual work to a geospatial application saving the industry billions of dollars from waste and errors.
- Nitex allows anyone to launch a fashion brand, compressing the global fashion supply chain into an easy to use interface. Nitex combines design, testing, sourcing and delivery in one simple application, dramatically lowering costs for fashion labels of any size, large or small.
- Productable helps companies exponentially increase innovation ROI through software that accelerates innovation management, cuts through corporate politics, empowers high potential bets, identifies what works, and quickly puts resources where they can deliver.
Sputnik ATX has also chosen one company founded by UT Austin students to participate in its Entrepreneur in Residence (EIR) Program. EIR companies receive $10,000 in funding and are invited to sit in on cohort classes for the duration of the three-month Sputnik curriculum.
- Bonsai improves customer service response times and accuracy with a plug-in AI tool that automates back-end platforms as it learns from responses, documentation, help videos and FAQs to generate improved responses in real time.
""Despite unprecedented circumstances these past several months we continue to be thrilled with the quality of startups that apply to our program,” said Joe Merrill, general partner at Sputnik ATX. “Our mission is to find the absolute best startup founders possible, so it is no surprise that they are as diverse as our great state of Texas.""
Companies accepted to the Sputnik ATX program receive three months of structured mentoring, a desk at the Sputnik offices for the duration of the program, and $100,000 in seed funding. At the end of the program cohort companies participate in a virtual Demo Day where they present to a room of investors. The next application round will open in November 2020. To be eligible to apply, startups are required to have a viable product, have at least one paying customer, and be located within a 300-mile radius of Austin or willing to relocate if accepted.
About Sputnik ATX Sputnik ATX is an accelerator in Austin, TX that combines capital with training and experience to prepare seed-stage businesses for future rounds of funding. Their formula: (Nerds + Investment + Training + Mentoring) Community = Success
Sputnik ATX was named after the first satellite to enter Earth’s orbit, an event that touched off a new era of innovation and competition that still influences the world today. The Russian word ‘Sputnik’ translates to ‘partner,’ which describes this accelerator’s intention: to partner with and mentor chosen startups. The accelerator was born out of a venture fund founded by Dr. Oksana Malysheva and Joe Merrill.
After investing in companies around the world, the entrepreneurial atmosphere of Austin inspired Malysheva and Merrill to consider the city as a new home for their efforts. Sputnik ATX launched on Oct. 4, 2017, the 60th anniversary of the Sputnik-1 satellite launch.

240,https://www.sputnikatx.com/our-name,"What's in the name 🇺🇦
We chose the name Sputnik ATX, because the Sputnik satellite was the first thing mankind put into space. It launched a wave of innovation more powerful than anything in history, and ignited the imaginations of artists, scientists and engineers, all around the world. Like the Sputnik satellite, we look for maker-founders who ignite humanity's brightest light. Sputnik means partner. Join us, and let's change the world.
Note: Oksana Malysheva, our founding Managing Partner, is from Kiev, Ukraine. We fully appreciate the questions people have about a fund named Sputnik in light of recent events in her home country. In the arc of history, we believe that the light of innovation outshines and outlasts any dictator and we want to honor all the great scientists and innovators who move humanity forward, together, in peace."

M Aerospace:
Juan Carlos Munguia
The traditional manufacturing process of industrial metal is a notoriously expensive and lengthy process. 3D metal printers have the potential to make metal manufacturing far easier, yet no cost effective solutions exist for industrial applications. M Aerospace’s team (previously at Honeywell, Safran and Collins Aerospace) has created the world’s first affordable large scale metal 3D printer. Their beachhead product, the Armdust 2.0, makes large metal parts cheaper and faster with the same or higher quality compared to parts made using traditional methods. The Armdust 2.0 can be placed on-site to make parts on-demand, eliminating supply chain and shipping constraints.

Patients can either pay the provider directly through Brightpay’s platform or request financing.
