https://drinksmootch.com/blogs/discovery/the-whole-grain-goodness-of-oats,"Oats, whether consumed as a porridge, in a granola bar, or in Smootch’s plant based electrolyte drink, are a delicious, nutrient-dense whole grain. We’ll be sharing the answers to common questions regarding oats and their role in lifestyle nutrition.
Where do oats come from?
The oat plant (Avena sativa) originated from Europe, where it was first cultivated 2000 years ago, but is today grown throughout the world. As of 2013, the top ten oats producing countries were Russia, Canada, Poland, Finland, Australia, United States, Spain, United Kingdom, Sweden, and Germany, with annual oat production totaling 20.73 million tons [1].
We are proud to say that the organic oats found in every can of Smootch are sourced from Aurora Mills and Farms in Maine.
What nutritional benefits do oats provide?
Oats are a popular staple around the world not only because of their versatility and flavor, but also because of their excellent nutritional value and extensive health benefits. Oats are a balanced source of macronutrients—a ½ cup serving of raw oats (40g) provides 4.4g quality protein, 27.4g slow-burning carbohydrates, 4g fiber, 2.6g fat, and a wide variety of vitamins and minerals[2]. Additionally, recent research has demonstrated their ability to lower LDL cholesterol, improve blood sugar management, stabilize blood pressure, increase satiety, and provide nature made immune support, due to their fiber and antioxidant content.
The endosperm of the oat grain is a significant source of beta-glucan, a type of soluble, prebiotic fiber. Beta-glucan fiber attracts water, forming a viscous solution in the gut, resulting in several purported benefits: decreased LDL cholesterol and blood pressure, reduced blood sugar spikes, and increased satiety[3]. Additionally, beta-glucans can strengthen one’s immune system. The binding of beta glucan to specific receptors within the immune system triggers a cellular response, enhancing macrophage and natural killer cell function[4].
Oats are the only grain that contain a specific type of antioxidant, avenanthramides. Research suggests that these antioxidants boost the body’s production of nitric oxide which, in turn, lowers and stabilizes blood pressure. Thus, these antioxidants potentially contribute to the reduction of heart disease, beyond the other known benefits of whole grains.[5]
Are oats gluten-free?
All oats themselves are naturally gluten-free. However, during processing, some oats may come in contact with gluten-containing grains. Therefore, individuals for whom cross contact with gluten may be a concern should opt for oats specifically labelled “gluten-free.[6]”
Summary
Oats are a highly nutritious food that can be enjoyed in many ways. However you choose to consume them, oats can help fuel you with the nourishment you need to function at your best and most energized level. Curious about the environmental benefits of oats? Next week, we’ll be discussing how oats and the power of regenerative agriculture can help save the planet.

What is Smootch?
Smootch is a plant-based sports drink with electrolytes and immune support made from regenerative oats
Oats? Is it oat milk?
No! It's a delicious drink similar in consistency to coconut waters, juices, or sports drinks! It's totally unique and very sustainable.
Tell Me More...
Smootch is formulated to hydrate and replenish with the highest quality ingredients. It has less sugar and more nutrients, with whole grains and gut-friendly prebiotic fiber. And, its better for the planet!
It's refreshing, satisfying, and tastes great!
... did you say clean energy?
Longer-lasting, low glycemic, made-from-organic-whole-grain type of energy.
Not a caffeinated or artificially infused energy drink.
When or why would I drink it?
Before, during, or after activity.
When you want to stave off hunger.
When you're thirsty and want something delicious. (That's also good for you!)
Why do I want this over other options out there?
It tastes great and is better for you!
Smootch is delicious, gut-friendly and sweetened organically! (No bad-for-you stuff here.)
It's also made with regenerative ingredients. We are proud to partner with responsible farmers. Check them out here.
What's regenerative... does it matter?
We think so... It's a farming practice that rebuilds soil organic matter and can help reverse climate change. It saves water, increases biodiversity, and more.
Did we mention it can reverse climate change? Oh, yeah, we did. It's that important!
Smootch is part of a growing, seismic shift in how we can offer consumers better, tasty options AND source ingredients responsibly.
We hope more will join us and be part of this meaningful change!
Return Policy?
Taste is subjective and we get that we may not be for everyone. And if you find you really don’t enjoy your Smootch, email matt@drinksmootch.com within 30 days of your purchase to request a refund of up to one (1) 8-pack case.
That said, a few things we’d recommend before deciding outright that you don’t enjoy Smootch:
Refrigerate your Smootch for at least 4 hours or pour it over ice before enjoying. Smootch is best enjoyed chilled. And please make sure you shake before opening! A few strong shakes is sufficient disperse the oats evenly throughout the drink.
Did you try all of our flavors? We recommend ordering a variety pack to start so you can figure out which flavors work best for you.
For legal purposes:
If you are dissatisfied with your product and/or something is damaged or missing from your shipment, please contact us at matt@drinksmootch.com and we may, in our sole discretion, issue a credit and/or refund to your account or replace the damaged or missing product. If applicable, the refund process will be initiated within 5 business days. Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular offer from us, all purchases are final and non-refundable."
