https://www.maerospacertc.com/post/3d-printing-in-dentistry,"3D printing in dentistry
Dental 3D printing facilitates the creation of surgical guides, crowns, aligners,
and dental prostheses adapting each solution to the patient with great precision.
Additive manufacturing has already affected a significant number of sectors and industries,
offering significant advantages in terms of productivity, costs,
customization, and manufacturing deadlines. For all the above it has already started
time to grow 3D printing in dentistry since it facilitates the adaptation of
solutions for each patient. The consulting firm QY Research revealed that the
3D printing in the dental sector will reach $930 million by the end of 2025, which
represents an annual growth rate of 17%, a growth that could
be explained by the constant development of 3D technologies and different materials. Of
In fact, printing in dentistry encompasses various processes, such as
stereolithography or direct sintering of metal, and therefore a variety of
Materials: resins, plastics, metals, etc. Offering a wide range of
Applications.
The dental sector can be divided into two families of actors: dental practices and
dental prosthesis laboratories. Traditionally, they work together in the production
of personalized medical devices (aligners, crowns, bridges, etc.). After
done, the dentist makes an impression of his patient's teeth and then sends it
to the laboratory, which will then fabricate the device, usually from plaster. A process
that takes a few days, not counting the trips back and forth between the dentist and the
laboratory. As for the patient, he is obliged to have another appointment, without guaranteeing that
the device of it has been adapted from the first test. Therefore, processes
traditional are long, expensive, and can lack precision. However,
The arrival of 3D technologies is putting an end to this work methodology and has
accelerated processes. When talking about additive manufacturing in the sector
of dentistry, it is important to understand that there are several technologies involved, whether it is
fused deposition, photopolymerization, or selective sintering, the choice
will depend mainly on the applications that we want to do it Olivier
Bellator, CEO, and founder of Biosummer3D said that each process has its advantages.
and disadvantages. FDM technology, for example, produces parts “at the cost of
a few tens of cents and without further processing after the
Print. On the other hand, the speed, accuracy, and aspects of
biocompatibility are not in this option. In general, this technology will create
dental orthodontic models that will be used to develop aligners, either for
alignment, whitening, or compression. It is a strong and light material that will improve
patient comfort. The framework of the prosthesis is produced without metal and will be
completely neutral in terms of taste.
Another additive manufacturing process used in the dental sector, and probably the
main: is light curing. Whether stereolithography or DLP, this process offers
much higher resolution, with significant levels of detail and especially
biocompatible materials, in this case, liquid resins. Anton Lopez, manager of
France sales at EnvisionTEC explained: ""Combined with approved materials
by CE/FDA, light-curing, and particularly DLP, offers more
accurate, allowing for more agile devices. The finish is much less
complex, which reduces manufacturing time. And it is very easy to change the material and
print different applications. This is very beneficial for the dental industry as
professionals can treat their patients faster.”
Finally, metal additive manufacturing is also a process that you will find
in dentistry, mainly to produce implants, prostheses, or crowns of
nickel-chrome. Olivier says that ""the technology requires sustained production to
repay investments of up to several hundred thousand euros with skills more
industrial than dentistry. Metal machines represent a cost
much larger than other technologies and will sometimes require more work from
post-processing, which could reduce productivity. In exchange for a technician
dentist, he explained that a crown made by machining requires 15 minutes of work,
while metal 3D printing requires 5 hours of printing.
However, in terms of cost per unit, additive manufacturing is much more
interesting (0.75 cents instead of 7 euros).
As you can see so far, 3D printing in dentistry is more precise and
reduces manufacturing time. In fact, you go from a day job to a few
hours, allowing in some cases to give the solution to the patient in a single consultation.
But what are the next steps to take when creating printed dental devices in
3D? Olivier Bellaton explains: “The physical prosthesis will be replaced by an impression
Digital 3D is made by the dentist with an intraoral scanner (a camera that will reconstruct
in 3D and in real time the surfaces of the teeth and gums). This 3D file is
sent to the dental laboratory through a secure web platform. The laboratory
will re-read the digital print and model in your design software (CAD) the
morphology of the crown taking into account the limits of the gingiva, the interference with
other digitized teeth, or even the shape of the patient's smile with a
face scanner. In case of any doubt, a quick screen swap
shared with the dentist to validate the shape of the crown will suffice. The file
3D of the crown can be sent to a machining machine or a 3D printer for
its manufacture. All that remains is to save and return the model to the dentist. East
last step can even disappear if it is the dentist who performs a simple job
with the 3D printer in his cabinet. All digital flow configurations are
possible. The process can take only a few hours, which in some cases
allows the patient to make only one visit.” At the end of the day, logistics flow and reduce
production deadlines, a personalized device that adapts much more to the
patient morphology.
Dentists and dental technicians will have to equip themselves with either 3D scanners
or 3D printers, but also to master CAD software, an obstacle to
many professionals today. Nicolas Klaus, responsible for the Development of
products and dental products at Formlabs makes it clear that ""the main pillars of
these new working methods are 3D scanners, CAD software, and printing
3D. In general, there is a resistance point at the software level where the
training is not obvious. «
Although 3D technologies have significant benefits for the industry, the fact
is that their adoption may scare some professionals because it requires a
new organization and work logic, software training, scanner and
printer, and some confidence. Today, many laboratories are equipped with
3D scanners and machining machines, including 3D printers. These
players recorded a 70% increase in sales, proof that they represent
real earnings for dental professionals. EnvisionTEC's Anton adds: ""The
Most professionals are very receptive and open to new
digital technologies. It involves asking doctors and dental professionals to
understand and trust the new digital technology and its benefits for themselves, their
businesses, and their patients. And, of course, education and training play a
big role. That is why many manufacturing companies are investing
in this area to better understand the technology and its clinical applications.
Therefore, the future is bright for the 3D printing sector in dentistry.
with many enthusiasts who see technology as a good way to improve the
efficiency and safety of their interventions. In fact, the 2018 report of
SmarTech Publishing showed annual growth in 3D printing in the
35% dentistry, reaching $9.5 billion in 2027; The report
takes into account hardware, materials and 3D printed parts.
3D printing has a high degree of applicability in the medical sector. in this post
We are going to talk about all the applications that this technology can have in
dentistry, such as ceramic 3D printing of dental pieces and prostheses.
By scanning teeth, in 3D we can produce parts and molds in a
faster and cheaper way than with traditional ceramic molds. The
technological advances in this sector are going very fast, and they already exist in the market
for different 3D printers for dental prostheses. The field of implantology is the one that
is benefiting from 3D printing.
In the same small space, we can have a team that designs and manufactures the
dental prosthetics we need. This is a great advance that speeds up
notably the delivery times and the logistics required so far.
In dental 3D printing, we need to have a 3D scanner, a
CAD design and a prosthetic 3D printer.
With a 3D scanner, precise modeling of the dental piece is achieved and it can be
printed directly to a printer. The precision is very high and in addition
Significantly shorten the implantation periods.
The pieces they implant have millimeter precision. The resulting pieces of
this technology are more adjusted to the morphology of the patient and are more comfortable.
The precision achieved with 3D printers is very important because
we avoid negative side effects such as the appearance of cavities under the
prosthesis, when it is not precise, and digestive problems associated with it.
It is also possible to speed up the production of prostheses, simplifying and reducing
the logistics chain of this sector.
3D printed prostheses have a better quality than those made with conventional methods.
traditional such as plaster molding.
Another great advantage is the enormous cost reduction that expansion can entail.
of 3D printing in the dental sector.
We have to consider that dental treatments are not covered by
public Social Security systems, which makes it difficult for women to access them.
most popular classes.
In the third world, it can also be a great solution to making a
more accessible dentistry.
As we can see, 3D printing has only just begun, and it still has a
wide field of development. In the future, we will find treatments that can be
performed in a single visit to the dentist, who will have the ability to produce the prosthesis
that we need, avoiding more visits.

Digital dentistry is based on three main parts:
• Digitization: in this case, it can be an intraoral scanner, an external scanner, or dental tomography. With the intraoral scanner, it is possible to obtain directly
the digital replica of the dental pieces, while with the external scanner
a plaster replica is necessary to be able to scan the teeth. The data
obtained by means of a tomograph will serve only for the planning of
implant positioning.
• Data processing: through this system the reconstruction of
digital models of the different pieces. From the digital model
The necessary adjustments will be made and the new prosthesis or bridge will be designed.
Dental pieces.
• 3D printing: from these systems, it is possible to advance on manufacturing
of the final geometry. Currently, with 3D printers, you can get
both plastic pieces that serve as study models or molds, such as
wax to later use in lost wax processes. Through this, it
can build removable prostheses such as those made in alloy
cobalt-chromium metal.
3D printing uses a standard data file, popularly known as
STL file, to translate the data from the CAD software to the computer
3D prototyping. The STL file contains the structure information by
Triangular geometric shapes or mesh of triangles. Furthermore, this type of
technology achieves a popularization, in such a way that it allows opting for the same
design and manufacturing capability that was previously exclusive to a few
designers and large production companies.
Throughout the history of mankind, objects have been constructed by eliminating
leftover parts of the material or using molds, however, the printers
3D create objects from 3D design and planning, adding material by
layers. 3D design software is essential in the 3D printing process, if
the printer does not receive the corresponding file and cannot print anything, only
when there is a correct 3D design, the material will be deposited in layers
correctly.
In general, the 3D printing process is as follows: the printer,
Following the instructions from the design file, deposit and solidify the
material. Once the first layer has solidified, continue with a second layer and,
repeating the same process, in such a way that layer by layer the
previously designed three-dimensional object. The evolution of this technology
3D printing will allow printing objects of different materials (non-existent today in
the day), with varied colors and even combined multi-materials.
Dental prostheses are artificial devices that serve to replace dental pieces.
original dental teeth lost totally or partially, in order to recover the
mouth anatomy.
In other words, it can be said that the purpose of the dental prosthesis is to recover the
oral health of the patient and improve the quality of life, since it allows chewing and
eat normally and have good pronunciation. Another compelling reason is reasons
aesthetic, since, thanks to the inclusion of dental prostheses, it improves
considerably the physical appearance of the patient.
Dental prostheses are made individually for each patient. uses
materials such as porcelain or acrylic. The base of the dental prosthesis imitates tissue
of the gum, thanks to a careful pigmentation called
polymethyl methacrylate, which comes from the accumulation of bacteria.
The prosthetic professional is the person in charge of manufacturing the prostheses, following
always the indications of a professional dentist. Two of the rules that always
must comply with the creator of the prostheses are the prohibition to work directly
on the patient and perform care work.
Dental prosthetics can replace a single tooth or the entire set of teeth.
The loss of a dental piece causes the adjacent teeth to tend to
commute. This has serious consequences such as chewing problems,
impediment of a correct feeding, or difficulty to maintain correct
oral hygiene, with the consequent increased risk of contracting diseases.
All these reasons explain the importance of replacing teeth that are
lost by dental prostheses, with the aim of maintaining proper health
oral and general
When are dentures required?
Tooth loss can occur in different ways. Some of the most
common are due to trauma caused by blows or accidents, eating
hard foods, diseases that deteriorate the teeth, poor hygiene
oral, etc.
When it is not possible to repair or clean the tooth with fillings, it is necessary
use dentures.
Types of dental prostheses
At present, there are different types of dental prostheses, adapted to the
needs of each patient
Fixed prosthetics
Fixed prostheses are those that cannot be removed by the patients themselves, that is,

2. Fixed prosthetics on implants. They are made up of a prosthetic structure
fixed through screws or cemented on the implants located within
the maxillary bones. It is used as dental treatment
restorative used to recover the functionality and aesthetics of the entire
mouth.
3. Hybrid prostheses on implants. This type of prosthesis combines the fixation of
implants with the mucosal surface of the gum to achieve adjustment of the
prosthesis. It is recommended in patients with bone resorption

projector. Get pieces of high resolution (1080p) and different hardnesses
(shore), with a large manufacturing volume (x 250 / y 140 / z 300 mm).
The best quality of this equipment is that it can work with many materials,
as its operation is not determined by the consumables of a specific brand.
However, there are certain recommended ranges, for basic or industrial use
with rigid resins, or through castable materials.
For reasons not stated by the manufacturer, this model has been withdrawn from the
market, from our own experience we have some notions of the reasons that have
motivated said withdrawal, but we will summarize it in that, in the first instance, BCN3D

3D printing, also called additive manufacturing (English), is a
set of processes that produce objects through the addition of material
in layers corresponding to the successive cross-sections of a
3D model. Plastics and metal alloys are the most
used for 3D printing, but almost anything can be used, from
concrete to living tissue.
A 3D printer is a device capable of reproducing a solid object
three-dimensional by adding material, the design of which is made in
computer. The process consists of adding material layer by layer and from
bottom to top 3D printing, also known as manufacturing
Additively, it creates three-dimensional components from CAD models. mimics
biological processes that add material layer by layer to create a
physical part. 3D printing is a group of manufacturing technologies by
addition capable of creating a three-dimensional object by superimposing
successive layers of a given material. A process by which they are created
physical objects through layering a material from a
digital model.
3D printing came to the rescue by creating 'phantom tumors': replicas in
plastic of real tumors that allow oncologists to work without risk,
testing and deciding on the most appropriate treatment and dosage without causing
side effects on the patient. 3-D printers do not print on a
flat substrate like traditional ink printers, but they do it in layers
successive, forming objects with volume. The first 3-D printers were
developed in the 1980s by an American engineer
named Charles Hull. The ""ink"" was an acrylic liquid that turned solid when
is exposed to ultraviolet light, usually from a laser beam. From
then its use has skyrocketed and is applied in many areas. Let's review the

▪ Surgical preparation
It consists of printing an exact replica of those organs or bones
damaged, which are targeted for surgical operation due to
any disease in them. The fact of having the organ in question before
of intervening in the patient's body, produces that the doctors can
practice on the printed organ and find the most viable alternative to
treat patients. This produces a more effective treatment a surgery
with less duration which translates into a faster recovery for
the patient.

comfortable, light and aesthetic. The most printed prostheses are those of
arms, hands, legs, feet, face, teeth and even limbs to
animals.
▪ Pharmacology
People taking precision therapy (specific treatment
based on the genome and differential characteristics of each person) have
a limit when your medication requires higher doses than are found in
the market. This is why 3d printing is an alternative in which you can
design dosage forms that are sent to print according to the
demand. It has produced impressions of various medicines, aesthetic
personalized and flexible doses, which truly creates a personalized treatment.
▪ Tissues and organs
3d printing of tissues and organs refers to the problem of finding
organs in donors to implant them in the body of patients. Can
produce them by this means is ideal to meet the demand for
people who do not find an available donor. Furthermore, the production of
tissues and organs is a functional environment in which scientists can practice their
hypotheses and experiment, without the need for the use of experimental animals.
laboratory
There are about two dozen 3D printing processes, which use technologies+
different printers, speeds and resolutions, and hundreds of materials. Are
technologies can create a 3D object in almost any shape imaginable such as
as defined in a computer-aided design (CAD) file.
The biggest advantage that 3D printers offer in medical applications is the freedom
to produce custom-made products and medical equipment. 3 For example, the use of
3D printing to manufacture particular prostheses and implants can provide a
Great value for patients and doctors. Another important benefit offered by the
3D printing is the ability to produce items cheaply
Among the latest uses of 3D printing is use in pharmacy. For example,
Developed by Ohio-based pharmaceutical company Appreciate, Spritam
Levetiracetam is a new medicine to control seizures caused by
for epilepsy. But what is really new is that it is the first pill printed in
3D. ZipDose technology uses 3D printing to create a more porous pill.
Its structure makes the pill dissolve more quickly in contact with the
liquid, making it much easier to swallow than a conventional tablet.
The 3D printing process also allows medicines to be packaged in
precise doses, pointing to a future of personalized medicine.
The study reveals that 11% of the income of the medical industry comes from
3D printed parts, whether implants or medical devices. this growing
interest could be explained by the need to personalize medical solutions
today it is for such a reason that 3D printing was a future innovation but now
it is an exciting reality. This technology presents incredible
growth opportunities, whether it's for engineers or doctors.""
It is already known that additive manufacturing technologies are changing the ways of
production, although it is still difficult to compete with certain conventional methods, and
the main reason is that the speed is still considered slow. 3D printing of
large series takes time and still does not appear as the preferred method for many
sectors. However, the medical field is very interested in this technology with
the ability to create solutions tailored to each patient. They are almost 7,500 million
of different morphologies to which doctors must adapt. 3d printing
then appears as a new solution to create devices
personalized to meet the needs of patients.
The American firm Allied Market Research calculated that the market for
medical 3D printing will reach $2.3 billion in 2020. This growth could
be explained by the opportunities in terms of personalization offered by the
additive manufacturing. To create prosthetics, implants, to better prepare an operation
surgery or to manufacture medical devices that facilitate certain operations
such as surgical guides or other visual aids. An implant is intended
to replace an organ over a long period of time or to supplement a either
more of its functions. Therefore, by definition, it is fully adapted to the
patient and his anatomy. Personalization is time consuming and expensive
when it comes to using traditional manufacturing methods. This is where the
Medical 3D printing is useful and helps design custom implants. Various
players have also started in this sector and use 3D technologies to manufacture
personalized medical devices an example of this is the French startup,
AnatomikModeling, who designed the first tracheobronchial prosthesis using
3D technologies. Its general manager, Benjamín Moreno, explained: «The use of printing
3D has several advantages: you can go directly from the 3D digital model to the
3D physical anatomical model, maintaining a very good precision. Save time
It is important especially if it is with reduced costs. This allows you to enter
completely in the era of personalization of medical devices. It is also
possible to make 3D anatomical models with very complex geometric shapes that
they would be very difficult to obtain through traditional manufacturing techniques.
Through the use of medical 3D printing, manufacturers of prosthetics and implants
can create solutions with the correct dimensions, with a complex design and at
a lower cost. Regarding the durability of the medical devices created,
even if the number of examples is still low compared to the methods
traditional ones, one can cite the example of 3D titanium cups that are still
as effective after being placed in the patient. This prevents the patient
change the implant every decade, which makes her daily life easier and spares her the awkward
surgeries.
Finally, medical 3D printing has also made it possible to automate the process of
creation of hearing and dental prostheses. According to the manufacturer EnvisionTEC, the number
of steps required to make headphones has increased from 9 to 3 in just a few
few years. He goes on to detail them: the audiologist first scans the patient's ear
patient with a 3D scanner to create an auditory impression. With these 100,000-
150,000 benchmarks, the analysis is sent to a modeler who shapes a
model. When it's done, it's printed from a resin and will be equipped with
the necessary components. The manufacturer estimates that 65 can now be printed
prosthesis per hour
. Medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the United States, a figure
alarming that could be reduced thanks to 3D technologies. This also becomes
in a means to rapidly implement surgical models with images of the
patient, which allows surgeons, and trainee doctors in general,
train before surgery and limit errors. These printed anatomical models
in 3D can also be presented to the patient before their operation so that they can
visualize all the steps of the operation, a way to also improve the relationship between doctor and patient.
Thomas Marchand, CEO of the French start-up BIOMODEX explains that 3D printing
“allows them to offer a real alternative to surgical training solutions
that are not satisfactory today (training in patients, anatomical parts of
carcasses or animal that poses ethical and logistical problems). Through a
web platform, the doctor can upload medical images of his patient, from
scans, MRI, or ultrasound. A few days later you will receive an organ from BIOMODEX
synthetic in which you can train, choose the right approach, the strategy of
correct function and prostheses adapted to the patient (size and position).
“Some of the most successful 3D printed patterns could even mimic the
bleeding, getting as close as possible to reality, which would increase the accuracy and
the efficiency of surgical procedures.
The goal is to reduce the number of medical errors by improving the training of
the surgeons. Animals or corpses would no longer be used, which is currently
logistical problems, but especially ethical ones. Dr. Ahmed Ghazi, Professor
assistant in the Department of Urology at the University of Rochester comments:
""Surgeons are like pilots. For everyone, we must go through the step of removing
a 747, alone, for the first time. For a surgeon, performing an operation from A to Z in
perfect autonomy is also mandatory. The pilots are preparing with
flight simulators, but until now surgeons did not have a system of
valid simulation.
Still restricted to research applications, bioprinting is a technology in
rapid development that has been growing significantly in recent years.
This is a method that allows you to create cell structures with a 3D printer
specific, which provides the ability to design living organs. Although they are not
functional long-term, we must highlight all the progress made. The
American company Organovo, for example, is one of the leaders in the sector;
he developed bone tissue and grafted liver tissue using bioprinting. Appearance
Biosystems, for its part, manufactured a bioprinter called RXI, capable of manufacturing
physiologically complex custom human tissue. A breakthrough I would try
different medications in organs specially created for the occasion, but
will also perform synthetic organ transplants.
Among the different applications of medical 3D printing, bioprinting offers the
opportunity to create skin, which helps treat serious injuries and helps patients
in his recovery. Marc Jeschke, a plastic surgeon, explained to us: Once you
can create synthetic skin from a patient's cells, completely changes
the situation because you can operate very quickly. We think about progress
conducted by researchers in South Korea, which combined two methods of
printing, extrusion and inkjet, which allowed them to create leather based on
collagen with a polycaprolactone membrane. Even if the developments still
are in their infancy, bioprinting of the skin could modify the surgical sector,
but also the field of cosmetics, where products could be tested
directly on bioprinted skin.
Another promising part of medical 3D printing is the possibility in a few years
to see the 3D printed medicines. The technology is there but the problem is
more regulatory. The pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated and must
meet many requirements to place it on the market. The FabRx company, without
However, she seems convinced of the opportunities offered by 3D printing in this
market; aims to produce 3D-printed drugs. One of his researchers
Dr. Álvaro Goyanes explained to us that «being able to create tablets or medical devices
simply modifying a 3D file offers many opportunities. the simplest
is to be able to change the size or fill (that is, the percentage of material within the
object) and thus change the mass of the tablet and, therefore, the dose of the drug.
Therefore, it is possible to adjust the dose of each medicine according to the
patient, much easier and faster. A particularly interesting development in
pediatrics according to Álvaro, where the age and weight of the child have a great influence on
the way the medicine is administered. The doctor adds that ""it would be possible
combining two or more drugs into one tablet, reducing the number of tablets
that a person has to take, which is especially important in
seniors"".
With respect to the printing technology used, FabRx uses a process similar to that of
selective sintering, and it is the powder that would contain the medicine. Alvaro states:
“Depending on the materials we select, we can achieve a release
very rapid or a targeted release of the drug in specific regions of the tract
gastrointestinal.
FabRx wants to equip some hospitals with 3D printers in 2 years. One of the
main challenges will be regulation; drugmaker says still
you do not know the steps of the validation process. If the 3D printing of the drug is
considered a manufacturing step, it will be subject to much control and regulation
highest; if a composition step is considered, the regulation will be less strict.
The truth is that the field of medical 3D printing reserves a bright future.
bright for
the emergence of additive manufacturing. In the next 10 years, the field of medicine
will have evolved thanks to the rapid development of technology and perhaps we will see the
first bioprinted functional organs, an innovation worthy of the best
science fiction movies.
When medical teams, for example from Doctors Without Borders, have to reach
areas far from civilization, one of the problems they face is the
transportation of their instruments and equipment, and adapt their procedures to be able to
perform them despite the limitations.
In addition, they must teach the local population to treat recurrent injuries, and
provide them with the tools to do so.
In all these cases, the problem is determined because any surgery requires
of a large number of different tools to function.
3D printers are an interesting resource, since they would allow avoiding the need for
stocks: whether a specific tool is needed or several need to be manufactured
copies of one piece, can be printed on the same day.
It is not an easy job, but it is not impossible either. And, in fact, it is what a
foundation, called precisely ""Not Impossible"" wants to achieve with actions such as
the daniel project
Daniel is a Sudanese boy who lost his arms in a bombing in the mountains
Nuba.
The foundation's co-founder, Micky Eveling, traveled to his village to meet him and
print an arm for him, as well as to teach the local population how to make it.
Thus, the democratization of personal 3D printers has made it possible to help
cheap and effective to an isolated population that still does not have the resources to access the
latest advances in medicine
One of the main difficulties in treating cancer is knowing how the body is going to
react to treatment, or if the cancer will grow in another organ.
For this reason, the possibility of testing the treatment on cells extracted from the tumor itself may
help avoid the repetitive (and exhausting for the patient) phases of trying a treatment,
while increasing the effectiveness and speed of healing.
Wake Forest University's Institute for Regenerative Medicine is taking a step
decisive in this procedure that they have called «metastasis in a splinter«, alluding to the use of
organoids from the patient himself. These organoids are in fact organs created with
3D printing, with cells extracted from the patient himself, in the case of the study of the intestine and the
liver, using biogels.
The goal is to create laboratory models of cancer spreading from one tissue to another, and to test
drugs in those organoids.
One of the advantages of this innovative system is that it can overcome shortcomings of the methods
traditional. As the university itself states, traditional studies using plaques, or

https://www.maerospacertc.com/post/3d-printing-methods-differences-between-fdm-sla-sls,"3D Printing Methods: Differences between FDM, SLA, SLS
There are many 3D printing technologies, but they all have a common purpose: to create 3D parts or models. All these technologies create parts through layers, but each one of them has a different process and choosing between them can be tricky.
In this article we’ll explain in depth the three most used plastic 3D printing processes we currently offer at M Aerospace: Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Stereolithography (SLA), Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)
FUSED DEPOSITION MODELING (FDM)
FDM technology is the most common in the world of 3D printing. It’s the most commonly used by amateurs who delve into this type of printing. It is one of the most frequently purchased printers since, in general, it has a fairly affordable price and is very easy to use.
The technique that FDM performs is suitable for simple parts, as well as prototypes and parts that could be machined. Compared to SLA and SLS technologies, the precision in FDM is very low, and therefore it is not the most suitable for printing designs with complex features. The surface finish of the parts is of poor quality and to obtain better results it is necessary to carry out some chemical or mechanical polishing.
STEREOLITHOGRAPHY (SLA)
Stereolithography was the first 3D printing technology invented in 1983. Over the years, developments in stereolithography made it accessible at the user level, resulting in much faster printing.
Stereolithography provides great precision and high resolution in its impressions, with very smooth surfaces and great detail, which is why they are regularly used in jewelry and cosmetic dentistry for the creation of molds. Materials for SLA have overdeveloped, creating resins with a wide range of optical, mechanical and thermal properties.
One drawback with this technology is that after being printed, the part must be immersed in a special solvent and, sometimes, in a UV oven to finish the curing process.
SLA is indicated for highly detailed prototypes that require tolerances and smooth surfaces, such as molds, patterns and functional parts. SLA offers a wide variety of functional applications.
SELECTIVE LASER SINTERING (SLS)
Selective laser sintering is the most commonly used method for industrial applications, since it has the ability to print resistant and functional parts.
In this process, the use of support (like polishing) is not necessary as in SLA and FDM, since what it does is create the layer first and then sinter it. This makes the pieces very precise and their finishes very fine. SLS is suitable for models with complex geometries, undercuts, interior features, and thin walls.
The material used in SLS is nylon. Nylon has excellent mechanical properties, it’s light, strong and flexible.
Each of these technologies have their advantages and disadvantages and are suitable for different applications. The following table compares some of the key aspects within this industry."
https://www.maerospacertc.com/post/3d-printing-services-in-m-aerospace-rtc-vs-printing-at-home,"3D printing services in M Aerospace RTC vs printing at home
The great advantage of 3D printing is that it gives the user the possibility of experimenting at home or business with home printers of an excellent level and quality. However, there are users who, although they like the design of parts, do not want or do not have the resources to afford trial and error when printing their parts.
This is why there are also 3D Printing service centers, such as M Aerospace RTC, where the user is allowed to instantly quote their own designs based on printing time and material. For their part, the same sites regularly have the option of completely designing what the client requires and then printing it and sending it directly to their home.
There are also so-called 3D printing farms that are Hubs or 3D printing centers (usually cheap 3D printers that in some cases offer quality 3D prints, with certain finishes or post-processing or some others are simply for prototypes and validation of concept), that is why when choosing a place to print your parts or models you must consider some aspects such as whether your part requires certain tolerances, specifications or will be subject to some mechanical stress and requires some special material or with some certification , things that generally 3D printing farms do not have such capacity.
Both options are usually inexpensive, but it depends on the application of the parts. Prints in filaments such as ABS and PLA will be economical in both options, the main difference lies in the experience of the person in charge of printing, on this it will depend if the piece comes out in one or several iterations, if it will require supports and the material of the themselves, as well as the positioning of the printing layers depending on the function of the piece.
On the other hand, there are also the emerging technologies of DMLS metal powder bed printing or sintered Binder Jetting that are alternatives to conventional machining of parts or plastic injection, these last two technologies are usually more expensive in most cases, however, if you learn to use Design for Additive Manufacturing (DFAM) methodologies, you will undoubtedly achieve the benefits of 3D printing. Such is the clear example where the same piece ""Propeller"" was printed by 4 different materials being the first printed in Metal at a high cost but very quickly to manufacture, in the second photo we have the same piece but molded in plastic requiring the manufacture of mold and tooling having a high initial manufacturing cost but in volume its cost decreases, and in the third option the piece is printed with SLA technology (resin), without the need for any associated cost and finally we take the same piece printed in SLA but a protective surface layer was applied to it to have similar properties to the metal printing part, without the costs of printing, since the matrix is plastic.
All these types of services are undoubtedly advantages of having your parts printed in centers such as M Aerospace RTC. If you have a project in mind that requires our services, do not hesitate to contact us. We can answer any questions you have, remember that we are the best option and the best 3D printing service in Mexico, Latin America and the USA."

Thanks to photogrammetry software, we are now able to use our smartphones to create 3D digital images. You take photos around the object you wish to 3D scan and then the photogrammetry software stitches the photos together to create your image.
In addition to photogrammetry 3d scanning, Apple's TrueDepth camera system and advanced lidar (light detection and ranging) technology allows you to 3D scan any object you want with a variety of 3D scanner apps on your iOS devices.
These are the best 3D Scanner Apps for iPhones in 2022!
Trnio
This is a very special app for phones with 3d scanning. Trnio has an object mode that captures images automatically while you walk around the object. You can capture anything from a full environment to the tiny details of a small object. Although the app has many capabilities, you must set up the scene before a scan to ensure the best results. Make sure the lighting is good (outdoor is preferred) and place the object in front of a blank wall to avoid confusing the scan process.
Scandy Pro
This user-friendly 3D scanning app offers real-time previews while your object is being scanned! If the scan is not what you envisioned or would have liked it to be, you can save wasted time and end the scan if you choose to do so. To ensure a successful scan, keep your phone stationary and instead rotate the object you are scanning, therefore the image stays in the camera's direct view the entire time. This handy app is free with in-app purchases if you wish to enhance your experience with Scandy Pro.

Tools have been used throughout history to extend a human's ability to create and modify objects. However, 3d printer tools are a new, innovative creation that has made these everyday tasks cheaper and more convenient. In addition to a cost and space-effective computer design, a major benefit of computer-aided design (cad) is the increased productivity of designers. In today's day and age, a cad design engineer can 3d print a design with the minimal tools needed for 3d printing and, in many cases, with minimal 3d printer accessories.
So what is a cad designer anyway? Cad is the use of computers to aid in creating and modifying a design. There are different ways to familiarize yourself with cad: you can learn cad design by taking a cad design course, working on cad design projects, and working on mechanical cad design or industrial cad design. You will be surprised at the amount of 3d print tools you can 3d sketch, design, and create.
Useful 3d printed tools come in many different forms, but have you ever wondered what the best tools to 3d print are? Here are the top five 3d printing must-haves for your 3d printer tool kit!
Fully Assembled Wrenches
What's a toolkit without a wrench? Although printed wrenches have limited functionality, they are a great tool to have on hand that you can create in many different sizes to fit your needs. In addition, these non-adjustable wrenches are invaluable additions to your 3d printing tools and can be designed on almost any software design tool.
Sanding Stick
This customizable tool is probably one of the greatest 3d print sanding tools you can create. Four sample sticks are available to secure sandpaper with printable screws, but if you feel inclined to make your own that better fit your needs, you can make them in all different sizes by modifying your product design cad. And best of all, you can easily do this without the best 3d printer accessories on the market!
Screwdriver Accessories
Screwdrivers are also essential to any tool kit. For example, the 3d printed ratchet screwdriver has a large grip handle for comfort and ease when screwing and unscrewing. You can also 3d print accessories for your screwdriver, like pocket-size bit handles, screwdriver bits, and nuts & bolts.
Wire Stripper
This DIY wire stripper is a great alternative to remove the wire's rubber coating and expose its internal copper strands. This single-edged industrial razor blade with two 3d printed parts is a great tool for cad mechanical design and tasks such as soldering. A great at-home printed tool made possible by industrial design cad.
Vices
We all know vices must be strong and sturdy for all projects in your workshop or garage. Thankfully when you 3d print your own, they can withstand the pressure needed to work properly.
Now that you have a head start on the first basic tools to add to your 3d printing tool kit let your imagination take over and test the many possibilities made possible by cad industrial design. I hope this inspires you to work with computer-aided design and drafting for future projects! Happy printing!"
https://www.maerospacertc.com/post/5-mistakes-to-avoid-when-designing-a-3d-model-for-3d-printing,"5 Mistakes to Avoid When Designing a 3D Model for 3D Printing.
1. Ignoring Material Guidelines.
Each and every printing material is different. Materials can be brittle or strong, flexible or solid, smooth or rough, heavy or light, and so on. This also means that an object should ideally be designed for a specific material. For example, if you know that you want to print your 3D model in Steel, there will be specific material-related design recommendations that you need to take into account such as supporting overhanging parts, strengthening elements that are sticking out, rounding off corners, etc.
The choice of your printing material simply pre-determines some of the basic design guidelines that you need to stick to.
2. IgnoringPrintingTechnology.
The best example of this is interlocking parts; in materials like ABS, Polyamide, Alumide, or Rubber-like you can print interlocking parts, while in others like Gold, Silver, Bronze, or Resin this is not possible. The reason behind this is not the material itself, but the technology that is used for printing each of these materials.
For ABS you need to use Fused Deposition Modeling (filament-based) with an extra nozzle and material for support, for Polyamide, Alumide, and Polypropylene you need to use Laser Sintering (powder-based), for precious metals we use lost wax casting (based on a 3D print in wax and a mold), and for the Resins, we use Stereolithography (liquid polymer-based).
This might sound confusing but the important thing to keep in mind is the following: we cannot assume that Stainless Steel and Silver will have similar requirements simply because they are both metals. They are printed using different technologies and thus some design features will differ. However, materials that use the same technology such as Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Brass (lost wax casting) are more likely to share similar design requirements.
3. Ignoring Wall Thickness
Problems linked to wall thickness are by far the most common reasons why some 3D models are not printable. In some cases, wall thickness is too thin. Walls that are too thin make small parts on the model unable to be printed or very fragile and could break off easily. In other cases, walls that are too thick generate too much internal stress and could cause the item to crack or even break.
4. Ignoring File Resolution
For 3D printing, the most common file format is STL (which stands for standard triangle language), which means that your design will be translated into triangles in a 3D space. Most 3D modeling software has the option to export your designs to an STL file and set the desired resolution.
Low-resolution STL file: It’s important to be aware that a poor-quality export will never provide you with a good print. Low-resolution means that the triangles in your STL file are big and the surface of your print will not be smooth. It will lead to a somewhat “pixelated” print.
Very high-resolution STL file: A file with a resolution that is too high will make your file too big and sometimes impossible to handle. It might also contain an extreme level of detail that the 3D printers simply cannot print.
5. Ignoring Software Guidelines
There are many different 3D modeling software packages. Some were designed for creating 3D prints, others are mostly used by 3D artists and their designs will require additional editing before they can offer a printable 3D model. For example, applying a wall thickness is automatic in some programs, while you must manually set it in others.
Even if you use beginner-friendly software that was developed for the sole purpose of 3D Printing (e.g. Tinkercad), you might still have a difficult time creating a hollow model. In this case, free software Meshmixer can help.
If you use software like Blender (used for 3D graphics and animations), SketchUp (popular with architects and scale modelers), or ZBrush (sculpting software for 3D artists), some further file preparation will need to be done. Depending on which software you are using, shells may need to
be joined together, models may need to be made watertight, wall thicknesses may need to be applied, and printing sizes may need to be set. Once again, each and every software is different."

Not only is bridging an essential tool for anyone with a 3D printer, but it also allows you to cut down on your 3D print support structures, saving you a lot of time and money! However, if you are new to 3D printing bridges or have had bridging issues and want to prevent lousy bridging using less filament, this is the most helpful guide to follow!
Within these six tips are two different types of solutions for perfecting your bridge printing: slicer/software solutions and physical solutions. Now let's get to the tips that will allow you to create unique 3D printing bridges and overhangs!
Tip #1: Lower Print Head Temperature
Try lowering your print head temperature. Lowering your print head temperature can be done by several degrees, but look at the optimal temperatures for your specific filament. One of the leading causes of lousy bridging is the extruder being too hot, which ultimately increases the 3d printer flow rate, not allowing it to cool enough. This is an excellent example of why bridging tests are often included in 3D printer temp towers.
Tip #2: Increase Cooling Fan Rate
Try increasing the cooling fan rate if you have already cooled the temperature and your filament is still sagging. This will move heat away from your filament more quickly by elevating the air the fans blow on your print.
Tip #3: Decrease the Extrusion Multiplier
Try decreasing the extrusion multiplier calibration if adjusting the temperature and cooling fan rate still need to fix your bridging problems. If the number of the extrusion multiplier is too high, you may experience globs in your print, as the multiplier determines the rate at that filament is extruded. On the other hand, lowering this number by a small amount might be the answer to all your problems!
Tip #4: Decrease Printing Speed
High printing speeds can result in highly messy 3D printer bridging. In addition, high speeds may cause gaps in your 3D prints. Try messing around with your print speed and reducing the speed in increments of 10-mm/s, but make sure not to go too slow because this will cause the filament to eventually droop.
Tip #5: Invest in High-Quality Filament
The tighter tolerance in high-quality filament allows for less variation in the cross-sectional area. That said, consider purchasing high-quality filament, as this creates more consistent extrusion, significantly reducing the chances of your filament sagging during 3D print bridging.
Tip #6: Use Dry Filament
Your 3D printer filament is the ultimate bridging material and must be in excellent condition. This means your filament must be fully dry to prevent inconsistent extrusion and bad bridging.
Lastly, if none of these tips seem to be the answer you were looking for, you can always 3D print with support, although it is technically considered cheating since the goal of good bridging is supposed to be avoiding supports. So try these six tips before breaking out the 3D printing support patterns, and get your bridging on!"
https://www.maerospacertc.com/post/all-the-possible-ways-you-can-3d-print-with-m-aerospace-rtc,"All the possible ways you can 3D print with M Aerospace RTC
M Aerospace RTC offers the following technologies for prototyping and end-use parts:
Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM): This printing technology is quite well-known in the market, and the most commonly used among 3D printing beginners. The printer fuses the polymeric filament through a heated extrusion header, which injects the material layer by layer to create the desired part.
Selective Laser Sintering (SLS): Sintering of plastic powder particles: Plastic powder particles are placed on a flat printing bed, and we utilize a laser beam to melt the necessary material, adding more powder layers and repeating the process until the part is finished.
Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS): This technology is specific to sintering metal powder particles, which, as mentioned before, are distributed above a flat bed and each layer is melted with a laser beam until obtaining the final part.
Stereolithography (SLA): We use a laser beam to melt plastic, which as a liquid then transforms into solid plastic layer by layer. This technology uses liquid resin inside a tank, and by the movement of the platform (it can be raised or lowered) the liquid resin solidifies layer by layer.
PolyJet: This method is based on technology similar to inkjets. It uses photosensitive resins which are injected in specific locations and solidify, a layer at a time.
Multi Jet Fusion: A 3D printing process that uses an inkjet matrix to deposit the material on a Nylon powder bed, heats the mixture and fuses the elements, and then the layers solidify. At the end of each layer, a new powder layer is added and the process repeats until the part is complete.
For more information and details about each technology, please drop your inquiries in the contact form and we will contact you as soon as possible.
Our American branch is currently in the acquisition process to obtain new technologies to satisfy our customers’ requirements. An upcoming technology we’re launching soon is:
Binder Jetting: This method can be considered a combination of two previous technologies. On a powder material layer, we deposit small drops of fusing and detailing ink on desired locations, according to the part geometry. We repeat this process until the part is complete."

What is it?
Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) also known as Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is an additive manufacturing process for metal or metal 3D printing. It is used for both prototyping and mass production of metal parts.
It consists of a bed of powders that is selectively sintered by means of a laser, the process is repeated layer by layer until the desired part is generated.
Use cases
◦ Fast delivery: Parts made with DMLS are produced in 1 to 3 days. This makes DMLS an option to consider if you need parts within a week.
◦ High complexity: Difficult-to-machine parts, customized medical parts, hollow or artistic parts fall into this category, DMLS is ideal for complex parts.
◦ Continuous revisions: Product development and iterative designs are adapted to DMLS technology because they do not have setup costs as in the case of conventional manufacturing processes.
Advantages
◦ Ability to do highly complex designs
The main advantage of DMLS is the ability to manufacture parts that cannot be made with conventional processes or are too expensive.
◦ Production rate
Conventional manufacturing processes require a lot of time for setup prior to fabrication which involves fixturing and jigs, whereas in DMLS the part is printed on demand without the need for tooling, resulting in reduced time compared to CNC.
Things to consider
◦ Support structures
Because DMLS uses powders as inputs the support structures are not optional and need to be removed during post-processing. During post-processing the printed metal part is treated the same as a conventional metal part in its raw material stage and requires additional work to obtain the finished part.
◦ Surface finish
The surfaces of parts made with DMLS will not have the smoothness that CNC machined parts have, nor will it be easy to achieve the desired finish. If post-processing is required to achieve the finish the cost of the part will increase accordingly.
◦ Mass production
Mass production tends to remain a determining factor in industries for the adoption of technologies and this is the point where DMLS technology falters and cannot compete with a conventional production line. Hence, DMLS is recommended for small quantities of parts as it becomes very costly to make volumes comparable to conventional manufacturing processes.
◦ Availability of materials
In the case of metal 3D printing, the amount of materials available is smaller, which can be limiting when looking for certain mechanical properties for the part to be manufactured.
◦ Build volume
When it is required to manufacture a part of considerable volume it is better to use CNC machining. To make it clear, in DMLS the maximum recommended size is 250 x 250 x 325 mm, while in CNC machining volumes up to 2000 x 800 x 1000 mm are possible. The difference in volume shows the limitations of DMLS due to the size of the powder bed.
◦ Shrinkage and repeatability
With DMLS it is difficult to produce identical parts due to the natural shrinkage process, dimensional changes are caused by a combination of three sources: thermal shrinkage, sinter shrinkage and the expansion that occurs due to the fall of metal particles during sintering. Errors of 2% are present in the Z-axis (vertical shrinkage).
Buy equipment or printing services?
The most important factor in determining whether it is desirable to implement a printing technology within the company instead of hiring the services of a specialized company is the work environment you have. In the case of FDM or PolyJet systems, they are suitable for an office environment. Laser sintering processes (such as DMLS) involve raw material in the form of powders which implies a special handling, adding the working temperature of DMSL printers makes necessary a controlled working environment as well as extra space for storage and recycling of powders. These factors make it more appropriate to contract a printing service for parts manufactured by DMLS.
Which materials can I use?
Among the most common materials:
◦ Aluminum, with alloys such as AlSiMg
◦ Steels, such as MS1 tool steel, 17-4 stainless steel and 316L stainless steel
Inconel, such as Inconel 718"

Technologically speaking, 3D printers are among the most advanced and futuristic devices available today. As the access to this equipment is becoming easier and cheaper, there are various areas and sectors that are betting on this technology.
Next, we are going to mention a little about the areas that are getting the most out of 3D printers and present an overview of what to expect in the future of this equipment.
The benefits that lead companies to invest in 3D printing are diverse:
· Lower costs: The cost of 3D printing a part can be up to 3 or 4 times cheaper than buying the part itself from a 3D printing provider, in addition to being able to have the part faster and also saving possible costs of transport.
· Streamline the production process: Being able to have any piece at any time is almost a dream for most companies, without worrying about manufacturing deadlines, carriers, requests for orders, etc.
· Quality, precision, and versatility: With the emergence of new materials, with each passing day more and more objects can be produced using 3D printers. Such objects range from prosthetics and organs to jewelry. Versatility is what is not lacking when investing in this technology.
These are just some of the reasons why investing in a 3D printer is extremely advantageous for many companies. But, if your focus is not for business use, as a private user there are several ways to earn money with a 3D printer without needing to have a large company or astronomical investments.
The most promoting sectors of the market for 3d printing are:
· Engineering: Engineers are specific professionals who work in certain market sectors. However, no matter how specific your area of operation, 3D printing can greatly benefit your services, since you can print replacement parts for your products, mock-ups to show your projects to clients and even enable the creation of prototypes for presentations and samples.
One of the main uses of a 3D printer in this area is the printing of parts ready to be used in the production of certain elements such as electronic components, the printing of gears, fittings and parts to complement the operation of an existing product.
The engineerings that use 3D printing the most are electronic, automotive, mechatronics, civil, production, and automation engineering.
· Architecture: The possibility of printing models instantly to present to your clients is an interesting differential value for architecture professionals.
Contrary to what many professionals believe, it is not necessary to invest in an absurdly large and expensive 3D printer model for this purpose. You can choose a model with the best cost-effectiveness and manually make the final adjustments to the printed model.
· Medicine: The use of 3D printing in the medical area is still in its infancy, but it is undoubtedly a sector with a lot of potential for 3D printing.
For doctors, dentists or veterinarians, the possibility of printing custom-made prostheses in a short period of time to treat their patients is something highly desired in these and many other branches of medicine.
Plaster pieces made from shapes are becoming obsolete to give rise to pieces made of materials that are biocompatible with our body, minimally invasive with the human and animal body, and with very short manufacturing times.
· Arts and fashion: Artists and stylists are already making use of 3D printers to print their sculptures, jewelry, shoes, pieces of clothing, etc.
These professionals can also work with the post-printing of the piece, giving touch-ups and adjustments to adapt them to the requirements of their clients.
· Space research: NASA has experimented with sending 3D printers into space, primarily for their ability to replicate replacement parts for aircraft in space in record time.
Instead of making the parts here on Earth and sending them to the spacecraft in orbit, the idea is to send only the material needed to print the part in space using 3D printing.
There are many companies that have adopted 3d printing in their processes to complement or directly create their products with this technology, others, on the contrary, are betting on this technology by creating their own models based on their needs.

For printing technologies that are used in the company, certain rules and tolerances must be met, in order to execute optimal printing. These specs may vary depending on the process or type of printer being used, but they will help ensure a great result.
Next, the general rules and tolerances that must be considered for these processes will be mentioned.
Holes: the minimum diameter for a technology to create a hole without any error is between 0.5mm to 2mm depending on the printer.
Text: refers to the font and size of the text since different sizes have different clarity, a thickness of at least 0.5 mm is recommended to have a clear letter.
Overhangs: the maximum angle at which the wall can be printed without supports is 45 degrees, exceeding this limit will require adding supports along the length of the wall.
Horizontal bridges: the bridges must be a maximum of 40 mm in order to generate straight lines and prevent them from beginning to flex.
Cliffs: for the creation of internal structures, the ideal is that they are 45 degrees, but they can be designed up to 60 degrees without the need for supports.
Wall thickness: on supported walls, i.e. connected to the rest of the print on at least two sides, it is recommended to use a thickness of at least 0.6 mm and on unsupported walls (connected to the rest of the print on less than two sides) the thickness should be at least 1.2mm. This will prevent the walls from breaking down.
Space between features: in the design there must be at least 0.5mm of space between the features of the pieces to guarantee that they do not join when printed.
Escape holes: in most printing processes material is trapped in confined holes, therefore, an escape hole of between 0.2 and 2 mm must be made, depending on the process, to release all that material.
Rounding: It is suggested to design rounded internal and external corners to mitigate transitions between features and reduce sharp stress points.
Tolerances: generally the expected tolerance of a process is between +/- 0.2mm. Remember that machines can be reliable and repetitive if they have been set up correctly.

If you are part of the world of 3D printing or if you are just interested, you will realize that there are many types of 3D printer filaments made of different materials. It will probably be difficult for you to distinguish them and know how they differ. In this blog we are going to talk in more detail about the different types of filaments, analyzing the differences between them and their usefulness so that you can choose the one that best suits your needs. Filaments can be made from different materials, but plastics are the most common materials and help the environment by requiring less fuel and less machinery to create the parts. To print in 3D, you can find filaments of two sizes, which are the most used in 3D printing today because they are easier to manipulate. It is very important to take into account the diameter of the filament that we are buying. This is because not all printers can work with the same diameter since it depends on the maximum capacity of your printer's extruder. 3.00 mm or 2.85 mm coils are the most common in industrial 3D printers and are used because they are resistant. 1.75mm coils are the most common for the general public. The diameter determines the amount of material, per second, that passes through the extruder. Which, must go to a temperature that allows the melting of the filament in an efficient way. We recommend choosing a 1.75 mm diameter filament because, being the most used, you will be 100% correct in your choice. In addition, you make sure that the filament you buy is of good quality, given its demand. Among the characteristics of a 3D prototype, we cannot fail to mention the kinds of filaments that allow its creation. This is because different materials exist and continue to evolve to optimize the quality of additive printing. There are filaments of various sizes, colors, and types. Filaments are the raw material that 3D printers use to make designs possible and all the amazing things that 3D printers can do. In general, they are made from plastics, but there are other elements, these printers take the filament and melt it at a certain temperature, by the extruder, to reach the melting point of the plastic. In order to choose a good filament, we must know our 3D printer. Thus, we will be able to know what material can be introduced and the maximum temperature that our extruder can reach. There are many types of filaments, and each of these has its own characteristics and uses. Before starting to print, you have to know the type of filament you want to use and what precautions you have to take. Cheaper 3D printers have a lower temperature limit. Therefore, when choosing a filament, you must take into account the thermal capacity of your extruder. Since improper use can affect the useful life of your product. There are many types of filaments to use in our printing machines. Each type has different properties and specific temperatures for printing, and each has a different finish. Advantages Wide variety of filaments. Diversity of colors and finishes. All kinds of objects can be created. There are filaments made from recyclable materials. Prices are affordable. Disadvantages Too much information for a beginner. Technically it is difficult. There are certain materials that are toxic. What types of filament for 3D printers are there? There are many types of filaments, the most common are PLA and ABS. Of these, PLA is the most used material for its ease of use in printing. Besides, it is a biodegradable material. On the other hand, ABS is a type of resistant and hard plastic filament, to the point that it can be sanded, glued with acetone, and even drilled.
It is ideal for making small parts, due to its lower coefficient of friction. For example, decoration pieces can be created, such as figures, models, and gift items. Also, it is being used in the creation of industrial parts, such as mechanical elements and gears, in the food industry, and in the creation of toys. We are only at the beginning of discovering the possibilities of 3D printing. PLA filament Polylactic Acid, commonly known as PLA, is one of the most popular materials used in desktop 3D printing. It is the default filament of choice for most extrusion-based 3D printers because it can be printed at low temperatures and does not require a heated bed. PLA is a great first material to use while learning about 3D printing because it's easy to print, very inexpensive, and creates parts that can be used for a wide variety of applications. It is also one of the most environmentally friendly filaments on the market today. Derived from crops like corn and sugarcane, PLA is renewable and, more importantly, biodegradable. As a bonus, this also allows the plastic to give off a sweet scent during printing. This PLA filament for 3D printers is ideal as it has the following characteristics: Odorless, permanent, clear and bright. Highly resistant to moisture and grease. Similar to polyethylene in developing taste and odor barriers. Sufficiently extensible and elastic. Its level of flammability is very low which makes it stable to UV light. Although it is flexible, PLA can be formulated to be rigid. It can be copolymerized with other materials. Its manufacturing process can be varied in order to adopt mechanical characteristics. The use of PLA material within 3D printing is ideal as it is a dimensionally stable biopolymer. On the other hand, this material in the form of PLA 3d printer filament is very easily
available and cheap. This biopolymer works more efficiently in the 3D printing machine. By using it, resistant products can be obtained using low temperatures during the manufacturing process. PLA has a relatively low printing temperature compared to other thermoplastics (its ideal printing temperature is usually 180°C, while ABS needs 220°C). This means that this material is less likely to warp in the printing process. Also, compared to ABS and other high-temperature thermoplastics, PLA filament produces better surface details and sharper properties. It is one of the easiest filaments to use for 3D printing. The material adheres easily to a variety of surfaces and does not require a heated print bed. Unlike ABS, PLA does not emit odorous fumes during the process. This material is easily pigmented and comes in a variety of colors and blends. In addition, PLA can be mixed with wood, carbon and even metal, while other pigments can be added to give the filaments luminescence or shine. Prints made with PLA filament are easily sanded, polished and painted, allowing an improvement in the surface finish without requiring much effort. Also, you can drill and glue PLA printed parts, just be careful not to melt the part. This is easily achieved by always keeping the tools cold. Biodegradable PLA is an environmentally friendly material as it is non-toxic, biodegradable and requires little energy during printing. A material made from petroleum, for example, takes thousands of years to break down. PLA filament parts, on the other hand, take a few years or even months. The material properties of PLA filament make it ideal for cases where aesthetics and shape are more important than strength and durability. Therefore, the uses of PLA tend to be more decorative than functional. They are also often a good choice for low-cost rapid prototypes, detailed and accurate models, cooking molds, and containers. In the automotive industry, PLA filament is frequently used to print tools, jigs, and accessories. However, it is important to remember that PLA cannot withstand high
temperatures and is a fragile material, therefore, its properties must be taken into account before using the print. In short, PLA filament is a great choice for industries and hobbyists alike. Its low price and ease of use are perfect for getting started in the world of 3D printing and generating low-cost prototypes. We hope that this information will serve you in your next impressions. ABS filament ABS filament is widely used in 3D printing. ABS filament has significant properties that make it a great choice, such as its strength and the fact that it is lightweight, while also being able to handle many different chemicals. The ABS material is also recyclable, meaning it is better for the environment than some other plastics by causing less waste. With a wide range of uses and applications, ABS filament is considered a very good material for 3D printing. It is available in every color imaginable, while the raw color is white. It is used with an FFF (FDM) printer and is wound around a spool. The filament unwinds during the 3D printing process. One of the main characteristics of ABS material is the fact that it is affordable, which makes it a type of additive manufacturing material that is favored by many industries. The cost of 3D printing with ABS material has been significantly reduced, due to the expiration of patents related to FFF technology, saving companies and industries a considerable amount of money. The physical properties of ABS filament are very good, such as a high level of tensile strength and stiffness. It is used for mechanical purposes and due to its electrical properties. Resistance to heat and chemicals makes ABS favorable for many applications, while also being flame retardant. Therefore, when it comes to printing and using an FFF 3D printer, ABS material is a popular choice. This is due to the way ABS material can be used for rapid prototyping at low cost and higher efficiency. Its features allow manufacturers to create 3D models that engineers and
research departments can use it to improve their knowledge and make their working methods more efficient and profitable. PETG filament PETG filament is made of a versatile material with high transparency and high impact resistance. It's easy to print with this filament plus it's tough, kink resistant and recyclable, it's tougher and offers higher impact resistance than ABS and PLA acrylic filaments. Its hardness and resistance customized it into a reliable material for many types of projects. PETG is resistant to weathering and ultraviolet rays, which means that it retains its hardness and never yellows. As with PLA, PETG filament can be printed very easily and the chances of warping are minimal. In post-production, PETG prints can be sanded, drilled, sawn, bent or cut without compromising the structural integrity or adhesion of the print layers. PETG filament can withstand various machining procedures, making it an extremely versatile material. Since PETG filament has a similar molecular structure to PET, the most commonly used plastic, PETG can also be recycled. Unlike most ABS filaments, PETG material can be recycled by traditional means or broken down through various machining methods for reuse at home. In addition to good mechanical properties and greater resistance to temperature than PLA, there are other properties that make PETG very interesting for specific uses: Approval for food use. PETG is approved by the FDA (the US agency that regulates food, drugs and cosmetics) for food use. This is a feature to be wary of for parts printed with PETG, which are printed or stored in an uncontrolled environment, can come into contact with contaminants, and have cavities and grooves that are difficult to sterilize. Chemical resistance. PETG is very stable and chemically resistant to attack by acids and bases. Transparency. PETG in its natural state (without colorants) allows around 90% of light to pass through, making it suitable for printing transparent or translucent parts. It also means that you can buy PETG filament in translucent colors, which leave a shiny
finish on the pieces and hide the striations of the layers very well. No odor when printing. Unlike ABS and similarly to PLA (which has an odor when printed, but is not a strong or unpleasant odor) PETG does not produce an odor when printed Recyclable. Being the material used in bottles and food containers, you can throw your failed prints and used parts together with the containers and bottles to be recycled. TPE filament TPE material is a flexible material. To achieve the best possible result when 3D printing with TPE material, you have to optimize the feed rate. The best results when printing with TPE will be seen when printing at a slow and consistent speed. As TPE has a high level of elasticity, it can mean that any sudden change can cause a loss of control in print speed. Fast print speeds can cause the filament to compress and cause a jam. Concluding: slow and steady is the best approach to take when printing TPE. It is extremely resistant to fatigue when it comes to flexing, making it perfect for those applications where flexing will be required. Due to its excellent electrical properties, it is often found in applications where it is required to prevent the conduction of electricity such as wiring. TPE is more difficult to print compared to other filament materials, mainly due to its flexibility. Advantages of using TPE or flexible filament: Flexible. vibration damping. Shock absorption. weather resistance. Tear resistance.
Long useful life. Impact resistance. They offer a variety of colors. PC filament Polycarbonate (PC) filament is extremely strong, durable and impact resistant. Today it is one of the most widespread thermoplastics in the manufacture of electronic devices, housings for household appliances, CDs, toys, etc. One of the biggest barriers to PC so far when getting into FDM 3D printing was its high melting point. However, with this Polycarbonate filament you can print at a temperature of between 250 and 285ºC, which makes it accessible for many 3D FDM printers. PC is a very rigid and resistant thermoplastic, with high resistance to impacts, good resistance to fire, which considerably withstands contact with oils, greases and solvents, with low deformation and which withstands temperatures of approximately 100ºC without deforming. In addition, it has good transparency, is considered a good electrical insulator and can withstand being exposed to the elements and sunlight well. Among its drawbacks, we can mention that it suffers deformations when submerged in water at high temperatures, that it is a somewhat more expensive 3D printing filament than others such as PLA, and that it gives off an unpleasant smell when it melts. The hotbed, for its part, must be at a temperature of 90º. It is recommended to print PC filament in a dry environment since humidity can affect the properties of polycarbonate, and with ventilation, due to the toxic gases produced by printing. ASA filament ASA filament is a thermoplastic made of acrylate, styrene and acrylonitrile, used in 3D printing that has properties similar to those of ABS filament. The similarities between both filaments are not too surprising, since these two materials share two monomers; acrylonitrile and styrene. This type of ASA filament was originally developed as an alternative to ABS with greater resistance to UV rays thanks to the type of rubber used in the
formulation. ASA is also known for its high impact resistance, its resistance to high temperatures and a greater difficulty in printing compared to other filaments. It is a material used mainly in outdoor applications due to its greater resistance to UV rays and its resistance to adverse weather conditions. Due to its heritage, ASA filament shares many of the drawbacks of ABS when printing. Warping remains a constant issue to be aware of, as well as the potentially dangerous fumes that the plastic emits while printing, due to the presence of styrene. ASA filament is especially resistant to weathering and UV radiation, making it the perfect material for applications created to stay outdoors. ASA filament retains its color and mechanical properties even after long exposure to the open air. It also exhibits greater resistance to environmental stress cracking than ABS, a process by which thermoplastics undergo brittle failure due to mechanical stress and attack by reagents. In addition to its excellent weather resistance, ASA also has good resistance to heat and chemical degradation. Products made with ASA filament can achieve high resistance to impact and UV radiation. ASA has good resistance to saturated hydrocarbons, lubricating oils, vegetable and animal oils, aqueous salt solutions, weak acids and alkalis, and water. However, it can be vulnerable to degradation by inorganic acids, aromatic hydrocarbons, esters, ethers, ketones, and some alcohols. One good thing about ASA's susceptibility to ketone degradation is that it can be polished with acetone, one of the most common polishing agents used in 3D printing.

Before you ship or receive your 3D print, it's a good idea to make sure your chosen space and environment are suitable for your printing, post-finishing, and finishing needs. You need well-level workspaces where you can place your printer(s) and post-finishing solutions like Form Wash and Form Cure, a space for support removal and finishing, and storage space for materials like wash solvent, resin tanks, resin cartridges, gloves, post-finishing tools, etc.
Remember the importance of considering some factors about 3d printing from home such as strange noises and smells, as well as proper ventilation.
Once you've set up your work area, gather the basic materials for the 3D printing process, such as wash basins, baskets and bottles, tweezers, a spatula, part removal tool, cutting pliers, disposable nitrile gloves, and all the other tools that serve you for your work process.
One of the main questions that an individual raises when assessing whether to buy a 3D printer for home use, is whether it will make it profitable.
The truth is that whether it is a 3D printer or a filament pen, the options for use are many and varied.
Without a doubt, it is necessary to know the line or need that you need to cover with 3d printing, from the creation of objects for personal and domestic use, home decoration, for office or business, spare parts, exhibition pieces, prototypes, etc.
If you are wondering if it is really worth having a 3D printer at home, the answer is yes! 3d printers have experienced an unprecedented increase in sales in all their ranges, there are more and more people who want to create their own objects in home, although it is not always easy to choose the right equipment for the parts you want to manufacture. A 3d printer opens the door to all kinds of projects, the design and production alternatives become infinite with an ever-increasing degree of precision.
It is logical to think that these printers are designed for small objects, but nothing is further from the truth since there are printers of various dimensions. Of course, one of the most important factors to consult before deciding which 3d printer to buy would undoubtedly be the material to be used. If what you need is functionality, you should undoubtedly ask if you want to manufacture flexible, rigid parts or parts with different mechanical properties.
Even consider materials capable of creating parts with properties such as heat resistance, impact resistance, chemical resistance and rigidity.
Resin or filament printer? That is a question that goes through everyone's mind when we want to buy a 3D printer. Both printing technologies use the same additive manufacturing process but different in the technology used to achieve said process.
Each printing technology has its advantages and disadvantages, and each has interesting variants that are worth learning about. Let's see a summary of each of the 3D printing technologies and then make a comparison: Filament vs Resin 3D Printer.
Resin Printing
Resin is a UV-sensitive, polymer-based liquid material. 3D printing with resin is based on VAT Photopolymerization technology, in which parts of said resin are solidified by applying light at a certain wavelength. There are 3 types of resin 3D printers at the domestic and industrial level: SLA, DLP and LCD. SLA printers use the stereolithography process to solidify the resin using a laser that creates the layer following the path indicated in the 3D design, while DLP printers use a digital projection screen to create the layers more quickly.
By using resin, quite thin layers down to 25 microns can be achieved and great detail can be obtained in prints. Supports are always required for the parts, and the volume of manufacture at the domestic level is usually somewhat small. They are suitable printers for the development of visual aesthetic pieces where mechanical resistance is not the priority.
It needs to be mentioned that some materials can create brittle components (with cracks), support structures can limit design freedom, and some components can only be UV resistant to a limited extent.
For SLA printers, the color palette is limited as these depend on the brand of printer. These resins are not interchangeable between printers and colors cannot be mixed between them. Unlike filaments, resins can have a more specific use, such as dental resins, and can offer a more durable use.
Adhesion / removal after 3D printing
Filaments stick on and off easily. In case the objects cannot be separated from the bed, a spatula can be used without much problem. For resins it is a little more complicated to remove the pieces. Sometimes there may be remains of the resin that must be carefully removed with a spatula.
When printing the material of the types of 3D filaments, the most convenient is:
Set an extruder temperature of approximately (198 ºC).
For small pieces and fine pieces, it is recommended to use layer fans (prevents the piece from being deformed or having a poor finish).
Use adhesives on the base to prevent the piece from detaching from the base. (Ex: lacquer, kapton tape, body tape…).
For filaments with dark colors, increase the temperature 3 ºC or 5 ºC with respect to the optimal temperature.
The technology of 3D filament printers (FDM) consists of depositing a melted plastic, layer by layer, until it forms a solid piece. Although there are many types of filaments on the market, only two completely dominate it due to how easy it is to work with them. These are PLA and ABS, which are more recognized for the material with which they are made. Generally, in 3d printing we use both filaments for the elaboration of the prototypes so that your impressions are made perfectly.
PLA, made with polylactic acid, are of natural origin as they are made with corn starch and sugar cane. One of its main advantages is the number of colors that exist for this type of filament that can be used for 3D printing. The finishes that can be achieved are many and they look great right out of the printer.
On the other hand, the ABS filament is made from a petroleum derivative, which is why it is more widely used for industrial parts. It is resistant to high temperatures and is very easy to handle during post-processing; it can be painted, polished or sanded without much trouble. Unlike natural filaments, which are non-toxic, these can emit harmful gases during the printing of 3D models. We use it mainly to make parts for the automotive sector that are resistant.
Knowing the types of filaments and how they work is an important part of the 3D printing process.
The prices of FDM printers are very cheap, they are easy to acquire and their maintenance can usually be carried out by anyone with sufficient knowledge. The printing times are slow for due to the routes that the extruder has to make to create the part. On the other hand, the print volume is usually higher than the SLA, achieving print volumes of up to 60cm x 60cm x 90cm. The post-processing of the parts made with filament is practically nil, in the case that supports are used for complex parts if it requires the removal of excess material.
The pieces also have a higher resistance to shocks, especially if they are made of impact-resistant materials.
Waste from FDM prints is less if a print fails if material is lost, but when a part is made correctly, waste is minimal.
FDM printers are very reliable, well established and easy to source for materials, as well as generally inexpensive. Use a filament printer if you are new or if you want to have varied printing options, in addition to the advantages of materials that we mentioned and its easy application.

What is Additive Manufacturing?
Additive manufacturing, usually known as 3D printing, has been in development since the 1980s. This technology has revolutionized the modern process of design and manufacturing, it allows development of new products and prototypes in a shorter period of time and at a lower cost, this depends on the technology to be implemented.
This technology lets you produce tridimensional physical objects directly from a CAD file by deposition of layer by layer of material, plastic commonly being the most used one.
Direct Energy Deposition (DED) Additive Manufacturing (AM)
Direct Energy Deposition (DED) is one of the most complex 3D printing processes, utilized normally to repair or add material to an already manufactured part. It is a process in which an energy source such as a laser beam or an electron beam is utilized to melt the material. In a similar way to various powder technologies, the material is melted by applying a molten mass upon a plate, upon which the powder is melted forming a deposition and creating the desired shape layer by layer.
According to the ASTM/ISO standard about terminology for AM (ISO/ASTM 52900-15), “DED is an additive fabrication process in which thermal energy is focused to fuse materials as they’re deposited”.
This technology is at the frontier between material extrusion and powder fusion, due to that, it’s possible to make models from nothing utilizing this technology, but it’s mainly used in industrial applications that require to repair huge elements such as turbines and helices that are damaged, to increase the service life of the element in which this technology is applied and as a solution to the breakage and deterioration of these elements.
Nowadays the DED process seems to be the predominant method to direct deposition of metal due to its high performance, low waste and greater construction volume. However, Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) keeps being used in high precision applications that require layers thinner than 250 millimeters.
This technology is one of the 7 categories of additive manufacturing process, DED being even more utilized in hybrid fabrication.
DED technology was developed by Sandia National Laboratories in the 1990s under the name of LENS (Laser Engineering Net Shape) and then commercialized by Optomec Design Company. Due to the variations on the energy source and end use, DED is also known as Laser Metal Deposition (LMD), 3D Laser Coating and Direct Light Fabrication (DLF).
Functioning
Depending on how this technology is used it is how the material will be deposited, either through a plate or above a component to be repaired, this is done by a multi axis arm (normally 4 to 5 axis arms are used). The material is deposited by a nozzle and as the deposition is being done, a heat source (generally a laser beam, an electron beam or a plasma arc) melts the material simultaneously, which is deposited layer by layer, this process is repeated until either the desired shape is achieved or the element to be repaired is restored. This process is characterized by having a great accuracy and being able to be used with polymers and ceramics, but its usually done with metals.
At the center of a DED system there is the head of the nozzle, which consists of its energy source and the supply nozzles which provide the powder supply, all of these supply nozzles converge on a deposition point in which the energy source is focused (e.g. laser beam). A multi axis CNC header or an articulated arm.
Normally, the build platform is part of the CNC multi axis system that includes the head of the nozzle.
An easy way to explain its functioning it’s by a series of steps which are executed by the DED system used, in this way, the action with which we want our additive manufacturing system to operate is carried out. These steps are explained below:
1. Using geometric data obtained from the CAD file, both the nozzle head and the build platform move to generate the 3D geometric characteristics.
2. The laser beam melts the surface and creates a small pool of molten metal on the substrate at the start of a long build route.
3. The feeding lines supply the powder through the nozzle in this molten pool.
4. Using geometric data obtained from the CAD file, the head controlled by CNC, the plate (or bed) or both, move along the build route to create the shape of the metallic part.
As it can be seen on the steps above, the functioning of a DED system is similar to printing with any other method.
In laser-based powder-supplied DED, the fused material is deposited by “blowing” the metallic powder through small nozzles or holes in a fusion bath created by laser. Depending on the power and type of laser used, the laser beam is focused to create a known dot size (e.g. 0.5 or 1 mm for a 500 watts laser versus 1.5 or 3 millimeters for 2.5 kilowatts laser). The depth and speed of the resulting molten mass are dictated by the laser scan speed (or the piece movement on the build platform below the laser) and the energy absorption and thermal conductivity of the raw material that’s being deposited.
The size of the fusion pool, the speed of laser movement and feeding speed (speed at which the powder is blown through the nozzles to the laser) dictate the quantity of powder that it’s captured by the fusion pool, and ultimately, the quantity of material fused to the piece: the layer that’s bellow and the adjacent material inside the layer that’s being built. A huge fusion pool, that’s hot, of slow movement will have a higher powder capture rate (70 to 80 percent in the best case) than a smaller fusion pool or with faster movement (capture rate of 20 to 30 percent in the worst case). However, the thermal history and, therefore, its microstructure and mechanical properties of the part will be different in the two cases. This is one of the challenges with DED, namely, adjusting the parameters of your process to guarantee a fast build time.
Once building rates are optimized for DED tend to be a bit faster than those of powder beds (Powder Bed Fusion or PBF). The size of the laser point for DED is at least 10 times bigger in comparison to the one used in PBF. This creates an objective fusion pool bigger for the powder to hit it, being melted and fused. Also, bigger powder particles tend to be used in DED systems (50 to 150 microns of diameter in DED versus 20 to 50 microns to PBF), as they tend to flow better and provide more surface area to accelerate the melting process. Bigger powder particles also allow thicker layers in comparison to PBF, that means less layers to build when using DED.
Types of Direct Energy Deposition
Even though DED technology can be used to make metallic, ceramic and polymeric parts it’s mainly used to make metallic pieces. DED can be classified by the following groups according the energy source used to melt the metal, and are therefore classified as follows:
Laser-based DED systems: they utilize the laser beam as their main energy source.
Electron beam DED systems: they utilize an electron beam to diffuse the raw material powder.
Plasma or Electric arc DED systems: they utilize an electric arc to fuse a wire.
DED technology can be subdivided in the following types according to the raw material that’s being used to create the pieces:
Powder based DED systems: they’re fed powder by a nozzle and it’s melted by a laser or electron beam.
Wire based DED systems: they’re fed by wires through a nozzle and utilize laser beams, electron beams or a plasma arc to create the fused bath.
Applications
DED is mainly used in diverse key industries such as aerospace, gas & oil, as well as the naval industry, for example, in hulls and airplanes structures, refractory metals components, repair and reconditioning of tools of ballistic material and marine propulsion, etc.
This technology can be implemented for various applications and fields, the following are examples for different applications and fields:
Repairing high value pieces (fabrication errors, production damages, piece modifications, etc.)
Increasing service life of pieces (for greater spawn of time)
Material coating (wear resistance, corrosion resistance, high and low temperature resistance, etc.)
Surface reinforcement (reinforcement for low carbon steels or high speed steels)
Manufacturing of parts and prototypes (with non complex geometries)
Industry
Aeronautical
Energy generation
Gas extraction
Petrochemical processes
Mining
Defense
It’s worth noting that the following examples are just a few possible applications and fields to which one can implement this type of technology. Notwithstanding, these examples are usually the main uses that are given to this technology and the various fields in which it is used. As technology evolves, this type of technology tends to improve and be used in a greater number of fields and therefore their applications tend to increase, so the limits to which this technology is implemented varies according to who is utilizing it.
As any other process of subtractive manufacturing, parts made by DED can be heat treated, hot isostatic pressing, machining or any of the usual finishes, which opens new applications. The majority of hybrid manufacturing systems utilize DED and its popularity has increased over time, thanks to the applications and fields in which it is applied.
According to the type of application and necessary equipment for the development of fabrication with DED technology it can be implemented to diversify other services in which this technology can be applied, to mention a few are:
Laser cutting: It’s a thermal cut which utilizes fusion or vaporizing highly concentrated energy to cut metal with the heat of a laser beam, generally with the assistance of a high pressure gas. With this process in which a laser beam can cut various materials, either metallic or non metallic.
Laser beam welding: It’s a welding process by fusion that utilizes energy provided by a laser beam to fuse and recrystallize the material or materials to join, in this way it produces the union of various elements. Normally it utilizes some type of gas like helium and argon, that serves as a protector gas.
Laser hardening: It’s the surface hardening in certain zones of the part, by a laser sweep, adjusting the speed, temperature and power of the laser, in this way it achieves minimum material deformation.
Laser engraving: The surface of the material is fused and evaporated by a laser beam, eliminating the necessary material. The result obtained on the surface is an engraving.
Materials
Normally direct energy deposition (DED) is utilized with metal which tends to be in powder or wire form, however, it’s possible to use this technology with polymers and ceramics.
Of the different types of elements that can be used with this technology, there are metals, as mentioned before. Any type of metal that can be welded can be printed with DED additive manufacturing. These metals include, to mention some, titanium and its various alloys, tungsten, niobium, tantalum, stainless steel, nickel and it’s various alloys, aluminum, etc. The type of wire used varies between 1 and 3 mm of diameter and its powder particles; its size it’s similar to the ones used in powder metallurgy processes, which are between 50 and 150 microns.
DED can utilize this wire feeding technology, where heads of a DED printer can employ a greater variety of materials for printers at a lower price. The only disadvantage is that the system resolution it’s necessarily limited by the wire thickness, typically about 1 mm of diameter.
Main market
The current market counts with a great quantity of 3D printers manufacturers, both of metals as of many other materials for printing, being in DED technology metal the main material to use. There exists a diverse market depending on the type of technology you wish to utilize, therefore it’s recommended to research the type of technology to be implemented and consequently the type of material to use, in this way you can start the investigation of which provider would be the adequate to get the desired printing technology.
Advantages and disadvantages of additive manufacturing by DED
Despite the different uses, characteristics, applications and fields in which this technology can be utilized, doesn’t exempt it from having some disadvantages, but having disadvantages means that it has advantages in its own favor, in the table below we show some its advantages and disadvantages:
Advantages
Great quantity of materials: Additive manufacturing by Direct Energy Deposition (DED) is a mature process, so there is advanced R&D regarding which materials can be applied.
Great operation quality: It adds a small heat contribution to the base piece, with almost null deformation and also null corrosion. It contributes to high density and low porosity.
Variable thickness: In comparison to other additive manufacturing processes, the measurements can vary from 0.03 mm to a few centimeters of diameter.
Existent parts: It can be applied in existent parts to achieve coatings or do reparations.
Production ratios: In comparison to other additive manufacturing processes, it achieves a high ratio value of 3-10 mm3/s.
High build rates: The higher deposition rates of DED on a relatively lower resolution means a higher build rate in comparison to other metallic additive manufacturing processes.
Dense and strong parts: DED creates parts with higher density, so that its mechanical properties are as good as the ones from forged or cast materials.
Almost finished shape: The parts can have almost finished shapes and therefore require minimum post-processing.
It can be used to repair: Ideal for applications that require the addition of material to existent parts, therefore, it lends itself to repair applications.
Bigger parts: Parts comparatively of greater size can be built utilizing DED, and can measure up to at least 1 meter of height.
Easy change of material: Since the material is fed during the process by separate powder containers, it’s easy to refill or change the material.
Waste material reduction: DED only deposits the necessary material during the process, which means less waste in comparison to processes like Powder Bed Fusion, SLS & DMLS where the entire building platform has to be filled with metallic powder.
Disadvantages
Productive limitations: Additive manufacturing by direct energy deposition suffers by production limitations associated with the maneuverability of its work axes.
Geometric complexity: It suffers a deficiency related to the capacity to produce any geometry.
Fabrication process: It’s necessary to give a surface finish and perfection the dimensions used, after additive manufacturing, also the surface roughness is greater than in other additive manufacturing processes, obtaining a value of 60 to 100 microns.
High capital costs: DED systems are comparatively more expensive than other types of additive manufacturing systems for metals.
Low construction resolution: The parts made by the use of DED technology have a lower resolution and more deficient surface finish in comparison to various of the different types of existent additive manufacturing processes. The surface will look sandy or like done by an investment casting process and will require a secondary post-processing, such as machining or water jet, which will add more time and cost to the fabrication and finishing of the part.
Doesn’t use support structures: Due to the nature of the way the DED technology builds parts, support structures cannot be used during the fabrication process.
Tolerances: DED machines generally can achieve a finer tolerance of 0.25 mm, which makes small features difficult to achieve.
Frequently Asked Questions

https://www.maerospacertc.com/post/health-risks-of-3d-printing,"Health risks of 3D printing
This article will briefly explore the different ailments associated with 3D printing, the most common raw materials for the different additive manufacturing technologies are the following: filaments, resins and powders. The first two, filaments and resins, will be grouped together because their health risks are caused by fumes generated by these types of materials. In the case of dusts, special attention will be given to them due to the high risk of exposure to them.
In general, the following health risks from exposure to additive manufacturing are presented:
Breathing harmful materials: 3D printing can release harmful particles and chemicals into the air.
Skin contact with harmful materials: Users may get harmful materials, such as metal powders and solvents, on their skin.
Fires, static and explosions: Some materials may be combustible or flammable. The high temperatures of some printers may cause burns.
The main risks to 3D printing exposure come from two sources, ultrafine particles (UFPs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The former are dusts and the latter will be discussed below.
VOCs can vaporize even at room temperature. These organic chemicals can then saturate the surrounding air and become health hazards. Some common materials in 3D printing processes, such as nylon, PLA and ABS produce VOCs of particular concern such as butanol and styrene.
Some VOCs are thought to be carcinogenic, however, VOCs can cause the following health hazards:
Central nervous system damage.
Irritation of throat, nasal passages and eyes.
Loss of general coordination.
Headaches.
Nausea.
Skin irritation.
There are 3 ways in which powders can interact with the body:
Skin contact, which may cause irritation or allergic reactions (e.g. dermatitis). If nano-dusts are involved, these particles can penetrate the skin and be absorbed into the cells of various parts of the body, including the brain.
Eye contact, causing mechanical irritation and damage.
Inhalation, resulting in respiratory problems.
In the case of inhalation, the size of the particles determines the level of penetration into the lungs.
Particles of nanometer size are of particular concern because of their ability to penetrate the skin and internal membranes, with the consequent potential to interfere with cellular activity.
The field of nanotechnology is still relatively new and it is too early to know what the long-term effects will be. It appears that at this size scale (nano) the composition of the powders is of less importance and it is rather their presence as foreign objects in the cells that causes the problem.
Nevertheless, there are indications that nanoparticles in general can cause a number of ailments, which will be discussed below.
Other hazards of dust exposure include the following:
Some dusts can cause granulomas on the skin and in the lungs.
Prolonged or repeated exposure to certain dusts can cause chronic rhinitis as well as pulmonary fibrosis.
Prolonged exposure to the eyes may cause conjunctivitis.
According to NIOSH, the following measures can reduce exposure to health risks from 3D printing:
Limit access to the equipment to trained or authorized personnel.
Use confinements for 3D printers and ventilation to capture their chemical emissions.
Use low-emission materials.
Reduce the time around the printer while the printer is working.
Train operators on potential risks and how to protect themselves.
Use appropriate personal protective equipment such as gloves, safety glasses, gowns and respirators.
To recapitulate, exposure to dusts can cause adverse health effects, both in the short and long term. It is necessary to reduce exposure as much as possible, and if it is not possible to avoid such exposure then it is recommended to consider appropriate personal protective equipment. In addition, dusts tend to be flammable as well as explosive so special care should be taken in environments where there are concentrations of dusts in the environment to avoid sources of ignition. Finally, it is important to be aware of the risks caused by filament and resin fumes but these are easily controlled with proper ventilation and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.

https://www.maerospacertc.com/post/how-does-additive-manufacturing-drive-smes,"How does additive manufacturing drive SMEs?
The 3D printing industry began more than 30 years ago, however, due to the high costs of machinery and the design restrictions that were implicit at the time, it took many years for the industry to become popular. Currently, 3D printing is an indispensable resource in the world of engineering, allowing rapid prototyping and the manufacture of experimental parts with lower production costs than those obtained with traditional processes.
In addition, in times of pandemic, the great advantage of 3D printing production times and the versatility of designs and materials for the protective equipment used by health personnel was demonstrated. Currently, 7 out of 10 healthcare professionals rely on 3D printing to transform their sector.
3D printing allows the user to create complex designs, customize each product, keep production costs low, perform rapid prototyping, as well as manufacture final products. Another of the great advantages of additive manufacturing is that it reduces the “scrap” that is commonly generated in manufacturing by traditional methods. In addition, in certain materials, the little waste generated can be recycled and reused.
As has been seen, 3D printing is one of the most promising technologies with the greatest economic impact that has been presented at the moment, this opens up a world of possibilities for companies in all sectors. Additive manufacturing is mostly promoted in the engineering and medical sector, however, it adapts to any type of market, which is why this sector has been recognized by SMEs, who recognize the advantages of printing 3D and bet on its growth in the economic sector.
According to recent studies, 44% of SMEs already use 3D printing technology and a further 30% are considering investing in the coming years, either due to the reduction of costs of storage, transportation or materials, for the versatility in the design and customization of the product or for the investigation of new manufacturing techniques. In addition, this technology allows the company to adapt to changing market demand.
As mentioned above, the opportunities for SMEs in the additive manufacturing sector are very large, but can be summarized in 3 main areas where this sector is profitable and makes work easier
1. Design and manufacturing/printing: Hardware, software and material. Product design could be completely in-house or outsourced. The machinery used can be handled by inexperienced users with the use of manuals.
2. Supply and service: Business relations with the companies in charge of transporting the printers, material and finished product are included. Courses for specialization in the use of printers may also be included.
3. Production: Constant manufacturing on demand, ease of product change without the need to adapt new molds or use different tools for each part.
For SMEs, the decision to invest capital in a new technology is not always an easy one. Although additive manufacturing has become quite popular in recent years and has enormous production advantages over other technologies, it is a relatively new element in the market, mostly in Mexico and Latin American countries, which can generate a feeling of mistrust for the investor or owner.
However, the benefits of investing in 3D printing technology come with such good references that it is very difficult to avoid thinking about it. When starting a business or renewing an existing one, the main points that any investor should think about are: investment, training and market.
The initial investment in additive manufacturing makes the idea of investing even more attractive: the cost of quality 3D printers keeps falling in the market due to the wide variety of suppliers. Today it is very easy to find competitive models for home use at prices below four figures. In addition, 3D printing allows the independence of businesses in terms of intermediaries and/or third countries such as China.
It is also well known that this technology avoids the need for a stock, which allows a better use of space and/or avoids rental costs or conditioning of places to store the stock. This technology allows manufacturing on demand, in addition to the customization of each piece without the need for expenses and/or setbacks due to having to change tools or create molds.
As a last point on investment, 3D printing reduces transportation costs by allowing local manufacturing. The material for the printers can be found with various providers on the internet that offer free shipping over a certain amount, with faster and more efficient waiting times due to the nature of the market.
Continuing with the next point: training. The knowledge required for the management of the different printers can be obtained through videos or courses that are easily on the internet, either on the direct website of the company that provides the printer or through the various course pages that exist; You can even find comprehensive tutorials on free sites like YouTube.
In addition, if a more specialized certification is desired, there are institutions with the appropriate training to certify users in different areas of 3D printing oriented to design, optimization or the printing itself, which could give more confidence to the buyer, as well as allow the company to provide higher quality work.
Lastly, the market. This point is one of the simplest since the popularity of the additive manufacturing market is exactly what has led us to write about it. The production versatility of a single printer is impressive and far greater than almost any other existing tool at the moment, which allows this technology to cover almost any market, from engineering to fashion to gastronomy.
There are currently thousands of start-up companies around the world with completely different approaches, there is, for example, the printer that manufactures houses in Spain by the company Be More 3D, which began as a project to print plastic key rings by young people just graduates of a bachelor's degree. Once the business started, the young people saw an opportunity, and with the help of engineers they built a 3D printer that was capable of printing optimally for the construction of houses, they obtained financing and now they have printed their first house in Spain.
Looking for local examples, we can find Prothesia, a Mexican enterprise dedicated to the 3D manufacturing of low-cost prostheses and orthoses, created by students of Mechatronics Engineering at the Tecnológico de Monterrey. They found a methodology that reduces the cost of the prosthesis by 50%, as well as the manufacturing time, this process can usually take up to 30 days in a traditional way, they can carry it out in a period of 48 hours.
Finally, we can also talk about the Mexican start-up 3D Factory MX, where university and postgraduate students carry out the printing of objects that can range from cell phone protectors to models of architectural designs. This company has even printed prototypes for other start-ups in the Mexican market. The most impressive thing about this startup is that it prints from a printer that the members built themselves.
In this way we can observe the versatility that exists in the additive manufacturing market. This market adapts to the vision of each company according to the interests of the user, it is a matter of wandering around the net a bit to find the inspiring stories of the people who decided to start in this business, some like Be More 3D who changed completely the turn of your company and your life in the industry, or those like 3D Factory MX who just want a business that helps at a national level and provides financial support to complete their studies.
Something very important to take into consideration when starting a business, both in 3D printing and in any other line of business, is knowing your customers. Income in a 3D printing business can come from the sale of services, modeling, scanning, equipment rental or the sale of printers or supplies.
In Mexico, the main customers at the industrial level are the automotive, aerospace and dental industries, mainly through the printing of molds and tools. On the other hand, for direct sales to users, great income can be found in areas such as jewelry, architecture, chocolate and student, as well as personalized products for the general public such as cell phone covers, key chains and personal items.
Another way to enter the additive manufacturing business without having to invest in a 3D printer is through services such as modeling parts for later printing or a 3D scanning service to recreate objects in the form of a digital file. Maintenance and repair service is also a viable business idea in places where there are 3D printing establishments, since the calibration of the equipment and the replacement of printer parts can be a complicated task for some users.
Finally, for those with ease of speech, knowledge and experience, there is the option of offering 3D printing courses, of course, this requires investment in time to learn everything necessary to be able to teach others. With the growth of tutorial platforms on the internet, it is now much easier to be a teacher on the topics that you are passionate about.
We hope that the information presented inspires you to start planning your business and its investment today. If you have more questions about it, do not hesitate to contact us on our main page or through our social networks."

To understand the operation of a 3d printer we must break down the parts that compose them, as well as the elements involved for the correct execution of the printing of the material.
3D FDM printer by parts, all these parts that make 3D FDM printing possible will be detailed. There are different types of FDM, but we are going to narrow it down to the most common of all, which uses coils of filament as a way of supplying the material.
Head also called hotend. It is where the material is heated, and melts, due to the pressure exerted from the extruder, it comes out through the nozzle, through a tiny hole. The size of this is important to know since the amount of material that can come out of the nozzle depends on it, and the smaller the more precise, but also slower, and susceptible to clogging.
In the head we also find the heating block, which is the part that houses a resistance that heats up, and this block heats the nozzle. To control the temperature, it also houses a thermistor that sends its signal to the electronics to control the resistance.
But it is important that this heat stays inside the nozzle, so that the material does not melt prematurely. To achieve this there are mainly two strategies: put a diffuser, or put an insulating material. The temperature limit at which the nozzle can work will be dictated by the design of this part.
The diffuser, usually made of aluminum, removes heat by transmitting it to the air, and requires ventilation to work properly. The temperature limit being metallic can be very high, but it adds weight and volume to the head.
On the other hand, with an insulating material, this heat is simply prevented from being transmitted to the wire, but the temperature limit is usually lower than with a diffuser.
Finally, in the highest part of the head there is the entrance of the thread. That in the bowden extruder system requires that there be a coupling for the tube through which the thread enters.
The extruder is basically the motor that pulls the thread towards the head, it does so by means of a knurled or geared cylinder. The most basic ones only grab the material on one side, but there are more advanced mounts that grab it from two sides, improving grip.
This knurled barrel may be on the motor shaft itself, directly transmitting force and speed to the filament, or there may be a reduction gear, increasing the motor's torque but reducing its speed. The latter is more optimal, because what we need is strength and precision, but it is more expensive and heavy. Though direct drive is usually sufficient for most DIY printers.
The extruder can be mounted on the head carriage, taking the material and putting it directly inside it. We call this direct extrusion, as the force towards the nozzle is almost direct. Especially if the filament from the grip is well directed and closed, this system is optimal for flexible materials.
On the other hand, in the bowden system the extrusion is far from the head, and for this reason we need to restrict the filament inside a tube that guides it. This allows the extruder to be mounted outside the moving carriage, significantly reducing its weight, but complicating the movement of the filament a bit, since the pressure that reaches the nozzle has a gap that depends on the stiffness of the material. This system has problems with flexible or semi-rigid materials such as Nylon.
The base is the surface where the piece sits, and where the first layer grabs. The grip of this layer is essential for the success of the print. To achieve this, most materials need to be hot, especially in a uniform and very stable way. That is why there is a heated bed in many printers below the printing surface. This can be a printed circuit that offers a resistance and heats up, which is very cheap, but enough to heat up to 100º, easy to assemble.
It can also be made of silicone with a zigzag resistance inside. A silicone covered resistor wire can heat up very quickly, and is therefore a bit dangerous if there isn't an extra safety circuit to stop it.
Underneath it can be insulated with different materials, fiber fabrics or cork sheets, among others. The point is that this directs all the heat towards the printing surface and is much more efficient.
The typical base material is glass. The borosilicate one can withstand temperatures better, but it is a bit brittle. Glass is ideal as it offers a smooth surface that does not warp with temperature and is a good thermal reservoir: making the temperature more uniform and changing slowly. Glass is also the most versatile material, since temporary treatments can be added: such as lacquer, cellulose glue, or ABS diluted in acetone. Blue tape can also be added to provide a porous surface for molten material to stick to.
Other typical materials are aluminum, which offers very good heat transmission, but for this reason it is not as uniform and dissipates the temperature very quickly. But it is cheap. That's why some manufacturers use it and glue a plastic sheet to the side. This combination is interesting if this sheet is magnetic and flexible. The adhesion of the plastic is good, and that flexibility allows the pieces to be easily removed once printed.
An interesting innovation is the ceramic surface. It is a very good heat transmitter and with the right materials and treatment, the ceramic pores open or contract at the printing temperature, allowing a very good grip when heated, and facilitating the extraction of the piece when it cools. On these surfaces they are a bit delicate, and no other treatment can be added and they have to be taken care of by cleaning them well.
As we will see when we talk about the types of movement the car and the base have to move. That is why guides are needed where the parts slide with minimal friction. And these have to be connected by straps to stepper motors, controlled by electronics. There are different types of guides:
· Cylindrical bars: In combination with cylindrical bearings, it is a balanced solution between cost and quality.
· Square rails: Much more stable and with less friction, but more expensive than the cylindrical ones.
· Wheels on guides: It seems like a cheap solution, and it is, but the rubber on the wheels absorbs vibrations, improving print quality. The crux is that they have a more limited speed, compared to the other bearings.
Of the engines we are interested in torque. It has to be enough to move the head, they have to be step by step to be able to control them accurately.
In a 3D printer we find different fans, each one with a function.
· Layer fan: This fan directs air towards the tip of the nozzle so that the outgoing material cools quickly. Some materials require this fan (PLA) but in others this cooling effect is very counterproductive.
· Diffusion fan: The heads with a diffuser need this fan to make air pass through it. It is vitally important that it is always on. And that the expelled air goes upwards.
· Cooling fan: The electronics require cooling. Especially motor microcontrollers, which have a tendency to get very hot.
· Hot runner fan: Some hot runner printers incorporate fans for precise temperature regulation. In addition, they can also incorporate a particle filter for the expelled air, which is very interesting for printing materials with toxic fumes such as ABS.
In a printer the most important electronic components are the following:
· Control board: The controller board is the brain of the printer. Here the firmware is processed through these remarkable elements:
· CPU: An 8-bit microprocessor with sufficient speed is more than enough to coordinate the motors and sensors, following the gcode, it is optimal for DIY kits. But more will be needed if there are more elements such as Wi-Fi or cameras, as we see in machines with more features.
· Microcontrollers: This part of the electronics is connected to the motor to control the steps it makes. It is a delicate section of electronics. It is interesting that they can be replaced (that they are not integrated), since they can be easily damaged. They also need to be able to microstep at least 1/16th on cartesian printers.
· Inputs and outputs: In addition to the necessary pins for motors, endstops, thermistors, and fans, you may be interested in having some more free to install improvements. It is also interesting that it is reconfigurable, to be able to adapt the electronics to the specific type of printer, in case it is DIY. It is also interesting that it has a 12v output to power the heated bed. Although there are configurations where the power supply is external to the board and this output controls the bed through a relay.
· Power supply: The stability and power of the source is essential, especially to supply power to the hot bed, which is what uses the most. But contrary to what it seems, a 3D printer does not cost much more, and it does not require a very powerful source. If it is not a large format printer, then the stability of the current is the most important thing to ensure that the microsteps are precise and without lag.
· Hot bed: It is a resistance that transmits heat to the printing surface, essential for adhesion and thermal stability during printing. The power of the bed helps to raise the temperature more quickly, and to ensure that it remains stable. Some only get to 50º fast enough, but take much longer to get to 100º. It is also important to take into account how that heat is transmitted to the printing surface, and if it is insulated on the other side so that there are no losses.
· Head heater: It is the resistance that heats the head. It doesn't have much of a secret. But it is what allows the deposition of molten material, precisely.
· Thermistors: These elements are the thermometers that measure the temperature at specific points: in the hot bed, and in the nozzle. In this way you can control the power to the resistors and control the temperature.
· Limit switches: This sensor is no longer a button, which when the printer is activated detects that the end of a movement axis has been reached. In this way position 0 is marked and allows the position of the head to be known from there.
· Connections: The control board must receive the necessary information to print through a gcode. This can be done by loading it from memory on an SD card, or USB. You can also connect the printer to a PC, via USB, ethernet or Wi-Fi.
· Control interface: Not necessary if the printer is always connected to a PC. But it is essential if the printer is to function autonomously. The user must be able to control the machine manually for pre-print preparation and during maintenance. It normally consists of a display and a wheel or control buttons, or these buttons may not be necessary if the screen is touch screen. These components require a separate board, and sometimes their own firmware, which communicates with the CPU firmware.
The software is programming. The written part contained in memory with the instructions to operate the machine. In 3D FDM printing we have these in particular:
· . gcode: this is a file that contains the step-by-step instructions that the printer must follow to generate a given object. It is generated in a slicer program, and the firmware interprets it and transforms it into signals to the printer components. The standard format is . gcode, but there are specific brands that work their own closed software.
· Firmware: This is the program loaded into the CPU that interprets the gcode and controls the printer components and receives information from the sensors. From the firmware you can control the printer if there is an interface. In addition, it can have other automatic functions, be they security or user help (such as auto-level). It is also configured according to the parameters of the printer, and has the basic variables already defined, such as the mm per step of each motor, the acceleration of the movement, the maximum positions in each axis, the safety temperatures, the functions of each pin on plate etc.
· Slicer: This program goes to part of the printer. But it is needed to generate the gcode of each object that you want to print with a specific configuration. Multiple printing parameters are entered in this software, such as head temperature, layer height, speeds for each type of movement, wall thickness, part internal structure, etc.
The frame is the part that holds all the components in place. Especially the axes. This part is important to evaluate the firmness of the movement, and if the extruder carriage or the base will be affected by inertia and vibrations. The firmer the structure, supports, and guides, the better. But it is also necessary to value lightness and low cost (especially if we are looking for a cheap printer).
We also include as structure any housing that contains electrical or mechanical parts. The electronics are not always closed, it is common in DIY kits that it is visible and unprotected. But in other printers you must take into account that it must be closed and with its own cooling.
Other casings may contain mechanical parts such as the extruder or head. Some carts have everything in plain view, but others choose to contain the components in a case.
The structure will mark the printing volume, since the length of the axes is what allows the head carriage to move. The advantage of FDM printers is that you only need to scale the spindles, and the base in some cases, to have a larger print volume.
The closed chamber is somewhat unusual for home or semi-professional printers. But it is necessary for printing certain materials that require stability at room temperature and high temperatures on the bed. It is also interesting that the chamber can be ventilated and thus isolate the fumes given off by certain plastics.
There is distance between many parts that must be electrically connected. Quite a bit of wiring is required in an FDM 3D printer, and it is essential that it does not interfere with movement. Depending on how the structure is made, this point can be a problem. And there are people who do not like anything that there are cables in sight. But it is usual that in the kits in the cheapest printers there is a bit of disorder in this part.
It is also important to pay attention to where they pass, since there are cables that heat up. There are different solutions to direct your development:
· Loose: Even in kits, it is a bad idea to have loose cables. At a minimum collect them and join them with cable ties, to the casing and to each other.
· Mesh: Inside a fabric mesh they are well collected, and it is an economical solution. Sufficient if the development of the cable cannot disturb other parties.
· Corrugated tube: similar to the previous one, but more rigid than the mesh.
· Spiral: Another system that allows you to put it on and take it off once you already have the wiring connected. Good solution for kits, with a similar result to the corrugated tube.
· Chain: Directs the development of the cable and restricts it to move in one direction, even if it is moving. Widely used for wiring to the extruder carriage, as it prevents them from interfering with printing, while remaining very hidden. It is the best solution, but also the most expensive.
Also notice how they move next to the cart or base. If there are scratches or bites in the long run it can be a critical point of failure or a serious accident.
Once the most common materials that make it up have been defined, we can define the operation of fused deposition 3D printing as a technique that is often considered the simplest existing method. Fused Deposition Modeling or FDM technology is based on 3 main elements: a print plate/bed on which the part is printed, a spool of filament that serves as the print material, and an extrusion head also called an extruder. In short, the filament is sucked in and melted by the 3D printer's extruder, which precisely deposits the material layer by layer onto the print bed.
It all starts with the design of the object using some CAD software (such as SolidWorks, Catia, TinkerCAD or Blender for example). The resulting 3D file, mostly in . STL, is divided into several layers using a software called ""slicer"" (such as Makerware, Cura or Repetier) in which it is possible to select the different printing parameters. Once everything is configured, you can start printing.
3D printing begins when the machine reaches a temperature of around 200°C, necessary for the fusion of the material. Among the most popular 3D printing materials in fusion deposition are PLA (Polyacetic Acid) and ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene).
Once the machine is heated, a 1.75mm or 2.85mm diameter filament of material is extruded onto the platform through a nozzle that moves on 3 axes x, y, z.
The platform moves down one level with each new layer applied, until the object is printed.
During printing, supports can be used to improve the quality of certain models. Its function is to support the protruding parts of the 3D model, since there are certain models that without support it is very difficult for them to be printed. These supports can be made of the same material as the printed object or in a material that is soluble in water or limonene, for example. Although more complicated to handle, some 3D printers are equipped with multiple extruders to combine multiple colors or materials (support materials in general).
Materials compatible with fused deposition modeling, fused deposition 3D printing is compatible with a wide variety of thermoplastic polymers: PLA and ABS, as well as polycarbonate such as, PET, PS, ASA, PVA, nylon, ULTEM and many composite filaments that are based on metal, stone, wood. This offers interesting mechanical properties such as conductivity, biocompatibility, resistance to extreme temperatures or conditions, to name a few. By replacing the 3D printer extruder with a syringe system, it is also possible to create parts from ceramics, clay, or food materials (such as syrup or chocolate). To give an idea of the price of consumables for 3D printers, a 1kg spool of PLA filament is around €35.

Due to the increased competitiveness in the market, a very common question is how much does a 3D printer cost?
That is why below we describe some considerations to make the decision to acquire a 3D printer or a home printer since home 3D printers are increasingly accessible. Once the user's specific needs have been determined, it is possible to find a printer that fits at an affordable value. That is why below we show the prices of some ""Economic"" 3D printers
Here are some examples of different models of FDM and SLA printers for home use:
1. Within open source printers, the Anet A8 is the cheapest technology on the market at the moment. Developed in China by Shenzhen, it offers print volumes of 220 x 220 x 240mm with a precision of 0.1mm. It is delivered as a kit ready to be assembled at home, and since it is FDM technology, it is compatible with filaments such as ABS and PLA.
Cost: $2,982.57 pesos approximately.
2. On the other hand, the MP Select Mini V2 3D printer is a proprietary FDM technology that comes factory assembled and calibrated, ready to plug in and start printing your parts. It offers a print volume of 120 x 120 x 120 mm with a resolution between 100 and 300 microns.
Cost: 4,8496.71 pesos approximately.
3. We can also find models of printers designed for beginners, such is the case of the Creality brand with its famous Ender 3, but being efficient enough for use by experts. It is an ultra-compact FDM technology weighing just 1 kg that comes factory-ready in models limited to 220 x 220 x 250 mm with a minimum layer thickness of 50 microns.
Cost: 7,274.57 pesos approximately.
4. A revolutionary brand today is undoubtedly the Anycubic brand, the FFF technology generally whose models Mega X or Mega Pro (with laser engraving), however, the favorite model of the Chinese manufacturer Anycubic is the Mega X that works with almost any filament like ABS, TPU, PLA and more. It has a print volume of 30 x 30 x 30.5 cm and a resolution of .05 - .3 mm
Cost: $12,000 pesos approximately.
5. For its part, SLA technology generally has higher prices than FDM printers, however, the Chinese manufacturer Anycubic launched Photon Zero which works with cheaper resins. It has a print volume of 97 x 54 x 150 mm and a resolution of 10 microns.
Cost: $4,098 pesos approximately.

Have you thought how much does it cost to print in 3d? o What to consider when buying a 3D printer?
If you are looking for a printer, it is important to know how 3D printers differ from each other, so that you can choose the one that best suits your needs. There is a wide variety of styles, which can be used by a particular audience or type of print.
Before buying a 3D printer, some specifications should be considered. If you already know the features you want in your printer, you don't need to know this information, but it will be helpful if you're a first-time 3D printer owner.
To get an optimal printer will depend on how you plan to use it, that is, you must first have established the project for which you will use it. For example, for a school purpose, you would purchase a printer that is easy to set up and use, requires minimal maintenance, and has average print quality. In design and other professions, it would be best to get one that provides surface quality prints. In companies involved in short-run manufacturing, a printer with a large build area will be necessary so that several objects can be printed at once. Now that you have the project set up, here's what to consider:
Printer Type (Freedom of Design)
You must first choose a printer where your printing process fits the plan you have in mind. There are different printing processes, among them there are three most common types, which are suitable for users with different levels of experience. The first is Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), it is based on heating and extruding a polymeric filament, this process is the most economical and suitable for amateurs. The second process is stereolithography (SLA), where ultraviolet light is used to photo-polymerize a photosensitive liquid. The third type is powder layer melting (SLS), in which powder is melted into a flat bed using lasers.
Supported Material (Supply Chain and Suppliers)
Each type of printer handles different materials, it is important to choose a machine that can print the material you want to use in your projects. The most common materials in 3D printing are PLA (polylactic acid) and ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene), they are thermoplastics and are known for their low cost, ease of use and versatility. You should know that while many 3D printers will accept generic spools, some companies' printers use proprietary spools or cartridges. Other materials used in FDM printing include materials, such as TPU, TPE, HIPS, PC, NYLON, ASA, PP, PETG, PVA. Each material has a different melting point, so the use of these materials is limited to the printers designed for them. If you want to use non-metallic powders such as polyamide or alumina you should choose a printer with an SLS process. For metallic powders, DMLS technology is used. Another type of material would be the resins where technologies such as polyjet and stereolithography (SLA) are used.
Resolution (Functionality)
The resolution of a 3D printer is an indicator of its print quality. A lower resolution results in better details in the print. Resolutions of up to 50 or 70 microns can be found in high quality printers.
Printing Area (Customization)
Confirm that the build area of a 3D printer is large enough for the type of parts you want to print. The build area determines, in three dimensions, the largest part size that can be created on a given printer. The build area on most common 3D printers varies between 6 and 9 square inches, but on some axes it can vary by a few inches.
Platform Type (Manufacturing Capacity)
It is considered a good platform when the part adheres to it during printing, but allows the part to be easily removed after printing is finished. a very common configuration is a heated glass platform covered with blue painter's tape or a similar platform. In this configuration the part sticks reasonably well to the tape and is easy to remove when printing is finished.
Project Cycle
You should also consider how you will increase the efficiency in your process by creating lattice-like structures, reducing material waste among many factors to achieve a good design for additive manufacturing.

One of the many advantages of 3D printing is that it allows the user the experience of creating their own pieces. In addition, there is an extensive community of users on the Internet with different levels of experience willing to help or provide ideas or challenges for new consumers.
The most common desktop 3D printing technology is FDM or FFF, which offers affordable prices and a fairly wide range of compatible materials that are also quite cheap. The only limitation of this technology is the size of the pieces, being a desktop printer it offers approximate dimensions of 200x200 mm.
The first steps in choosing a 3D printer is to take into account your needs:
· Printing materials: The most popular materials in home printing are ABS and PLA, you can find the descriptions of both materials in our 3D Printing Materials section.
In summary, both materials are low-cost filaments that have very good properties for prototyping and even for final parts. The main difference between both materials is the handling of the filament during printing and its cooling process.
· Printing system: Currently there is a wide variety of 3D printing systems at an industrial level, however, for a domestic scale, the most recommended is FFF or FDM technology. Within the 3D printing community it is possible to find tutorials for its use, this technology melts the filament and deposits it on the printing bed layer by layer until the piece is completely formed.
· Trademark or DIY: As mentioned above, the world of 3D printing allows the user to experiment with designs, materials and prototypes, but also allows the user to experience building their own 3D printer.
There are DIY models that invite the user to live the adventure of setting up their own 3D printer, prices are regularly more accessible because they are free designs. In addition, by assembling the printer itself, the user has the opportunity to learn more about how it works. For questions, the 3D printing community has all the answers.
On the other hand, commercial models are faster because the printers come out of the box, no technical knowledge is necessary to start printing your designs. And, being closed designs, you can always go to the manufacturer's page to consult the common questions of a new user.
Returning to the question how to buy a cheap 3D printer, you have to know your needs: if you are looking for a printer to experiment, to improve your skills, or perhaps to start your business. Once the objective that the technology will fulfill is recognized, you can begin to detail: what level of precision am I looking for?, printing times, part quality, etc… in addition to taking into account if you will have to get accessories such as a heated printing bed. , closed printing chamber, extractor, among others."

Additive manufacturing has become an important manufacturing process for production. This type of technology offers many advantages within companies, such as being a profitable solution for production on demand, reducing the cost of tools, expanding design possibilities, among other advantages.
Undertaking 3D printing goes beyond selecting parts, investing in printers and looking for material suppliers. If you're looking to get started with additive manufacturing, it's essential to consider a few things before you get started.
Knowledge in 3D design
3D design is totally linked to 3D printing since you must have a CAD model before sending it to print, therefore, if you do not have knowledge in 3D design, you will not be ready to adopt additive manufacturing. Although, more online repositories are available to download CAD models that are ready to print, these models are not suitable for commercial use. Therefore, it is necessary to look for design programs to start digitally designing and creating your own models for certain solutions. To get the most out of additive manufacturing you will need to delve into the topics of topology optimization and generative design tools.
3D printing learning curve
3D printing is not just buying a printer, sending it to print and getting the part, but it requires a learning curve on this subject. The analysis of the design must be known to know if the part will fail when printed, if it meets the tolerances required by the printer, and to know if it will meet the objective of the part. You should also learn what preparation and operations to carry out for printing.
This topic is a bit extensive, because each 3D printer has a different functionality, just as each material has a different behavior in each type of printing. Therefore, if you already have a 3D printer, you can begin to learn how to control the printer, its characteristics, as well as the configuration parameters of the 3D models in order to be printed. All that this learning requires is to be able to have an optimal printing process.
What materials will you use?
The variety of materials for 3D printing is quite limited, especially metals. This is because the materials used were not designed to be heated and extruded through a nozzle, or melted with a laser. Therefore, you have to have defined what type of materials you want to use for your projects and if 3D printing can handle these types of materials.
You must take into account that certain materials will not work in the same way in additive manufacturing as they do in other types of processes.
The selection of the material is also accompanied by the type of printer that will be used, since the same materials are not handled in the different processes. Therefore, you will first have to select the material and then acquire a printer that handles it, according to the project you have in mind.
Be clear about the project or objective
If you have a project that requires 3D printing of a single piece, it would be best to first use a printing service where a specific printer and material will be used, in order to validate if that printer works for your project and to know what material to use.
On the other hand, if the objective is to generate different types of parts, it would be necessary to obtain a machine that is more versatile, that is, look for a professional printer that has a larger volume to be able to modify and adapt its configuration to the needs that arise. ."
https://www.maerospacertc.com/post/how-to-smooth-your-3d-prints,"How To Smooth Your 3D Prints
Have you been trying to figure out how to smooth your 3D prints? Do you find your 3D printer layers not looking smooth? It's likely that you're dealing with PLA, as it is the most common FDM 3D printing material and not to worry, smoothing PLA prints is easy when you have the perfect guide and right materials! Here are some of the ways to create smooth, ""finished"" 3D prints.
1. Remove Excess Material
If your print has some excess material, try using a utility knife or rotary multitool to get rid of those unwanted edges to be able to properly finish your print. When using these tools make sure not to use excessive pressure in the risk of removing too much of the material, which would end up damaging your print.
2. Sanding
3D print sanding is easily one of the most accessible ways to smooth out your prints. There are many different ways to approach sanding PLA prints. If your print is larger with more surface area, you can use a sanding block or try sandblasting your 3D prints. However, if your print is smaller with many little details, you should consider using loose sheets or even nail files you have at home! At the end of your smoothing process, try wet sanding your 3D prints to get that sleek, polished look.
3. Surface Melting
Smoothing PLA with heat is possible, although PLA is not particularly considered ""heat-resistant"". You can smooth PLA with a heat gun to achieve a smoother finish to your 3D prints. You don’t want to overheat your print, so make sure to set the heat gun to the lowest setting and start smoothing from there!
4. Surface Coating
Adding an extra surface of coating to your 3D prints is a great way to limit the appearance in texture and an easy way of how to get rid of 3D print lines! Two common materials used for surface coating are primer and epoxy. Coating your prints is going to be more time-consuming, but most of the time, both common methods give you a clean, sleeker look than sanding.
5. Chemical Smoothing
PLA acetone smoothing isn't an option, as the nature of the PLA material doesn't work well with the acetone chemicals, however there is another option. Polymaker Polysmooth is composed of a material that closely resembles PLA, so this chemical can be used to smooth PLA prints. To purchase the Polymaker kit is expensive, but it might be worth it if you have a lot of smoothing projects coming up!
Now you have all the information you need on how to make your 3D prints smooth! Try out one (or all) of these methods on your next 3D print that comes out textured and wait to be amazed at the wonders these methods do for your prints!"

The popularity of 3D resin printers is surging now that the technology involved is more affordable for consumers and small businesses.
While the first wave of cheap resin printers opened the eyes of many to the quality of the devices, their capabilities and the possibilities they bring, the first resin 3D printers were all very small in size. Some users may be happy with a small resin vat, but others need larger build volumes to accommodate larger and more ambitious projects.
With increasing demand and technological advances, a bevy of affordable mid to large size printers appeared on the market, and the number of large resin 3D printers is growing and growing.
SLA technology printers are becoming more popular for good reason. What was once thousands of dollars worth of technology is advancing to another year of countless machines capable of producing incredibly detailed prints in almost no time at all. And best of all: they've become ridiculously cheap, and they're getting better all the time.
This article covers the best resin 3D printers from small to large sizes, from low-end printers geared for home makers to high-end options for businesses that are willing to invest more in a resin 3D printer.

Creality HALOT-ONE
The Halot-One has a monochrome LCD display with 2K resolution, WiFi connectivity, a 5-inch color touchscreen to operate the printer and a respectable 130 x 82 x 160 mm build volume. For the most part, it has similar specifications to the Creality LD-002H. With a resolution of 2560 x 1620 pixels it gives us a print granularity (XY) of 50 microns, which is somewhat average for the low-budget sector. This means that quality prints are possible but will be no better or worse than the competition.
It is worth mentioning the air purification system of the Halot-One which consists of a fan with an activated carbon filter, similar to the system in the LD-002H. This should help filter out some of the potent odors that are generated when printing resins.
Anycubic Photon Mono 4K
Recognizing the need for higher resolutions, Anycubic brings to the market the Photon Mono 4K as well as its big brother, the Photon Mono 6K. With respect to the Photon Mono the obvious differences are the 4K LCD screen and the 35 micron resolution (XY). The Photon Mono 4K is essentially the same printer except that it doubles the number of pixels. Its 6.23 monochrome LCD panel gives us the same 132 x 80 mm print area and 165 mm for the Z axis. The difference in resolution between the Mono and Mono 4K is a decrease, from 50 microns on the XY axes to just 35 microns.
In addition to being a 4K panel it is also monochrome, which means fast curing times. In other words, fast prints. Layer cure times of 1 to 2 seconds are the norm. Anycubic says it has a print speed of 50 mm/h. According to Anycubic the LCD panel used in the Mono 4K offers a contrast ratio of 400:1 making it twice as good as the original Mono. The increase in contrast means that the image projected on the monochrome LCD has sharper lines and corners, improving print quality. In other words, sharper prints.
Elegoo Mars 3
The Elegoo Mars 3 is our top choice in low-budget resin 3D printers. There are a number of reasons for this. With its 6.6-inch 4K display, it can print at an ultra-fine 35-micron resolution, has a large build volume and brings back the best parts from past iterations making it a balanced machine while still being easy to use and affordably priced. Currently hovering around $350 USD, it includes a one-year subscription ($169 USD) for ChiTuBox Pro slicer software, making the Elegoo Mars 3 not only capable but highly affordable.
The Mars 3 is the sixth version of Elegoo's popular low-budget resin printer. In addition to being the sleekest Mars yet, the printer also comes with several performance advantages. With a build volume of 143 x 90 x 165 mm it is very large for a small resin printer and by including a 4K LCD screen it can print at a fine resolution of 35 microns.
While it is not the first printer to bring 35-micron resolution to the low-budget sector (kudos to the Phrozen Sonic Mini 4K), it does so with considerably more build volume than its competition and predecessors. On top of that, it combines the best parts of its previous iterations into a balanced machine while preserving the same workmanlike attitude for which it has always been appreciated, it works without any complications.
Anycubic Photon Mono SE
Sporting a monochrome LCD display, the printer promises curing times as fast as 1 second per layer. Its LCD screen is 6-inch 2K with 2560 x 1620 pixels as the light source. This gives us a resolution (XY) of 51 microns, combined with Z-axis precision of 10 microns, not the best resolution you can buy on the market, with numbers as low as 30 microns on the XY axes but the level of detail is so fine on the Photon Mono SE that it is indistinguishable to the naked eye.
One benefit of using a monochrome LCD is that the lifetime of the display is extended, offering thousands of hours of use unlike its non-monochrome (RGB) counterparts. Users of the Photon Mono SE will have a build volume of 130 x 78 x 160 mm at their disposal. This is slightly above average compared to its competitors in the low-budget segment, beating out its predecessor Anycubic Photon S, Elegoo Mars Pro and Phrozen Sonic Mini 4K.
Elegoo Mars 2
Being the direct predecessor of the Mars 3, the Elegoo Mars 2 remains our basic low-budget resin 3D printer option. It is close to being (but not quite, see the Voxelab Proxima) the cheapest mono-LCD resin printer and offers a fine printing experience. With simple software and on-board operation, installation is child's play and the build plate is one of the easiest to level. Of course, the print quality is also good, but the big difference between this printer and the Mars 3 is that the Mars 3 produces slightly more granular prints.
In many ways, the Elegoo Mars 2 is the quintessential low-budget resin printer. You get a monochrome LCD for even faster cure times, the familiarity of use for which the original Elegoo Mars is valued, the standard resolution for its size of 50 microns in the XY axes, arranged for a build volume of 129 x 80 x 150mm.
Natively compatible with ChiTuBox software, a free and easy-to-use slicer software, plus a single-screw leveling system, which is easy to level, all add up to make the Mars 2 a capable and hassle-free printer. Compared to its big brother, the Mars 2 Pro, we see little reason to spend $70 more (approximately), when for all this extra money spent you only get an activated carbon filter that is a pain to replace and a metal resin vat that looks no better than the clear vat of the Mars 2.
If you want to spend more money on an Elegoo resin printer then we recommend the new Mars 3, which offers a slightly larger build volume as well as a higher print resolution. But the Mars 2 stands on its own without much trouble.
Voxelab Proxima 6
The Voxelab Proxima 6 is an aggressively priced resin 3D printer from Flashforge's Voxelab sub-brand. Typically found under $200 USD, the Proxima offers fast prints thanks to its monochrome LCD, in addition to its comfortable build volume of 130 x 82 x 155 mm. This is perhaps the strongest point of the Voxelab Proxima. It is an average printer, but in a good way. Costing less than most of its competition and offering the same print experience and quality it is a safe choice for entering this budget conscious segment.
Boasting 2560 x 1620 pixels in its 130 x 82 mm build area this translates to a horizontal resolution of 50 microns in the XY axes, again putting the Proxima in the same range (even the same build plate) as the Elegoo Mars 2, the Nova3D Bene4 Mono and the Creality LD-002 H found in this article. Compatibility with Voxelab's proprietary software called VoxelMaker may be a cause for concern, since Flashforge's other slicing software, FlashPrint, is generally the weak point of this manufacturer's printers. Not the case here, the Proxima is natively compatible with the ChiTuBox software out of the box.
Creality LD-002H
The Creality LD-002H resin 3D printer is a solid alternative to the Elegoo Mars Pro, with few differences between them other than price. History repeats itself again in the LD-002H, with Creality and Elegoo following in lockstep, as the new LD-002H has broadly the same features as the Elegoo Mars 2 Pro.
Inside this printer, you have a monochrome LCD with a 2K pixel resolution (2560x1620), allowing you fast cure times, air filtration via a replaceable activated carbon filter that is located inside the print chamber, and with a build volume of 130 x 82 x 160 mm. Printable area is standard for this new cohort of monochrome LCD resin printers, which typically have 6-inch LCDs. Pixel size or horizontal resolution (XY) is slightly higher than Creality's LD-002R, growing from 47 to 51 microns.
The LD-002H uses ChiTu firmware and is compatible with ChiTuBox slicing software, a combination that allows for a simple workflow to adjust and print with the machine.
Nova3D Bene4 Mono
The Nova3D Bene4 Mono substantially raises the bar for ease of use and convenience. At around $280 USD, it costs more than other printers with similar print quality, such as the Elegoo Mars 2 and the Voxelab Proxima, but that money difference is visible in several extras, features and design elements that make it simpler and generally more pleasant to use.
WiFi connectivity and 8 GB of internal memory are the first features to highlight, with the former allowing you to conveniently start and monitor your prints from your desktop. The printing plate comes already leveled from the factory, making it very easy for you to get started, especially for those who are new to printing. And it comes with a flip-up lid that gives you full access to the print chamber, an improvement over other low-budget printers with flip-up lids and the other printers with bucket lids found in this article.
It sounds wonderful, and it is, but you have to avoid the proprietary slicer software, NovaMaker, which just causes headaches with its incorrect printer settings and other things that make it unusable. However, the popular slicer software Lychee has full support for this printer with its Bene4 Mono profile, including WiFi connectivity.
Anycubic Photon Mono
The Photon Mono is among Anycubic's most affordable printers and the one with the least features of their offerings. Its main feature is that it has a monochrome LCD panel with 2K resolution, basically it can print fast. Standard resins can be processed with cure times as fast as 2 seconds.
There is not much to distinguish the Mono except its curing times, but that is becoming the norm. This doesn't mean it's not a good printer, because it is. It prints fine details quite well. All things considered, the Mono is a decent printer that prints fast but you have to consider its price relative to the competition.
Phrozen Sonic Mini 4K
Phrozen was the first to bring monochrome LCDs and fast cure times to low-budget resin printers with the Sonic Mini, and got it right a second time with the Sonic Mini's premium successor, the Sonic Mini 4K. As is probably clear, this printer has an LCD display with 4K resolution, making high-detail prints with resolutions of 35 microns possible.
With a build volume of 135 x 75 x 130 mm, it doesn't have the largest print dimensions, especially since the capable and similar Elegoo Mars 3 hit the market, but at $350 USD, the Mini 4K still maintains a competitive price point, and we expect in the future it will drop further in price as the Sonic Mini 8K takes its place in the market. If you don't want ultra-high resolution, don't mind the bulk of smaller builds, and for some reason want to avoid Elegoo, then the Phrozen Sonic Mini 4K is the printer for you.
Anycubic Photon Mono X
The Anycubic Photon Mono X is our top choice in large resin 3D printers. It offers a larger build volume than the Elegoo Saturn, comes with some convenience features like remote control, and has recently dropped significantly in price, not least because of the release of the upgraded Mono X 6K version. It is still a solid recommendation today, but, everyone always wants a little more sophistication.
The mid-sized resin 3D printer impresses with its ability to print parts with its 192 x 120 x 245 mm build volume. Like other printers in the article it uses a monochrome LCD display, its 4K resolution gives it a pixel size (XY) of 50 microns, a resolution in line with the smaller and cheaper Elegoo Mars 2 printer, Voxelab Proxima and the Creality LD-002H also found in this article.
Anycubic wants you to use the Photon Workshop software with the Mono X, which is workable. However, we found it lacking compared to the ChiTuBox software used with many other printers. Fortunately you can do just that and drop the Anycubic slicer in favor of ChiTuBox, the same applies to the popular Lychee slicer.
Phrozen Sonic Mighty 4K
The Phrozen Sonic Mighty 4K has a larger build area than many similar printers. A side-by-side comparison with the Anycubic Photon Mono X will make you think they are similar but the Mighty 4K has a slightly larger build area of 200 x 125 mm compared to the Mono X's 192 x 120 mm. It's not as tall, but we consider the surface area more important than the build height.
With a 4K LCD to enable fast prints and competitive print resolution, with a slightly higher pixel count than similar medium/large format machines. However, this is ""cancelled out"" by the larger print area, leaving it with a pixel size of 52 microns on the X and Y axes, a difference of 2 microns, when compared to the 50 microns of the Mono X, is unnoticeable.
The Sonic Mighty 4K is so named for a reason. With its 9.3-inch monochrome LCD screen and 4K resolution, it offers one of the largest print areas and build volumes in the range in which it competes. Phrozen made compromises with the Mighty 4K, such as only allowing print files to be uploaded via USB, the inability to monitor printing remotely, the quality of the touchscreen as well as design details, such as the tank fixture and switch location. The end result is a decrease in the usability of the printer compared to its competitors.
Original Prusa SL1S Speed
The $1,999 USD price tag of the Original Prus SL1S Speed is not easy to swallow, especially when you consider that the print volume (127 x 80 x 150 mm) and screen resolution (XY) is 49 microns and is on par with resin printers priced under $300 USD from Elegoo, Creality and the rest of the manufacturers. However, value is in the eye of the beholder and the SLS1 Speed excels with a wealth of features that make it easy to use and are designed to ensure a successful print.
The SL1S Speed replaces the SL1, and besides having switched to a monochrome display for faster cure times and a slightly larger build volume, the SL1S Speed retained the same convenience features as its predecessor, resulting in a resin 3D printer that warns you if you are going to run out of resin mid-print. Also, the resin vat tilts after each layer change to separate the resin from the print vat. This measure is used to ensure sharper results, but we did not notice any significant difference from resin printers that do not tilt their vat during printing. Perhaps it is unnecessary but it is unmistakably Prusa, making the SL1S indisputably a premium printer that goes out of its way to justify its high price.
One distinct advantage of the SL1S Speed that is easy to overlook is that there is an abundance of official support documentation and channels to turn to for information on construction, usage, troubleshooting, not to mention the Prusa Printers website, which contains 3D models that were verified to be printed on the SL1S Speed. You're buying more than just hardware, it's an ecosystem.
Anycubic Photon Mono X 6K
The Anycubic Photon Mono X 6K is a resin 3D printer that looks almost the same as the printer with which it shares most of its name but with one crucial difference, it has a 6K resolution LCD screen. This means a resolution (XY) of 34 microns and, in theory, sharper prints. There is also a few millimeters difference in build volume, a new build plate and a better light source.
The new Photon Mono X &k has a 9.25-inch monochrome LCD display with a resolution of 5760 x 3600 pixels compared to the original Mono X's 3840 x 2400, a noticeable increase. However, the size of the LCD panel is not that different, the original Mono X has an 8.9-inch panel so the 9.25-inch panel of the 6K is not enough. The biggest difference is in the resolution, the Mono X has 50 microns on the XY axes while the 6K offers 34 microns of resolution. However, it remains to be seen if you will be able to notice these benefits in the quality of your prints, the promotional information shows them, but will your eyes be able to notice them?
A few millimeters difference in build volume matters little. The Mono X 6K is slightly larger than the Elegoo Saturn but much smaller than jumbo printers like the Elegoo Jupiter and Phrozen Sonic Mega 8K. Incidentally, if you don't need a large build volume why pay more for one.
Fundamentally this printer is an upgrade of the LCD panel to 6K resolution and the other changes are small, which leads us to believe that there will be no noticeable difference in performance. The Mono X 6K should print significantly better than the original Mono X to be recommended.
Elegoo Saturn
The Elegoo Saturn is our choice for large resin printers on a budget. At $500 USD it is the cheapest option for getting started in medium-sized resin 3D printing. While its build volume is not the largest by today's standards, it offers enough space for anyone who wants to get creative without having to spend considerable sums of money. If you want a reliable printer without running out of money, the Saturn is your choice.
The Elegoo Saturn was released in mid-2020 and brought with it a lot of buzz. It brings with it an 8.9-inch monochrome LCD display with 4K resolution with a build volume of 192 x 120 x 200 mm. With 3840 x 2400 pixels across the print surface, it gives us a resolution on the XY axes of 50 microns, all for the paltry sum of $500 USD, a good price for the specs it carries.
We liked its ease of use, reliability and wealth of convenience features such as the elevated resin vat and simple print plate fixture. With its competitive price, it can compete with many of the other offerings in the printer range it resides in, as long as you're not looking for ultra-fine resolution.
Epax E10 Mono
The Epax E10 is the company's debut in the large, low-budget resin printer sector, which is, in some ways, a more affordable version of its flagship printer, the Epax X10. Armed with an 8.9-inch monochrome LCD screen and 4K resolution, as well as a build volume of 192 x 120 x 250 mm, which gives a resolution (XY) of 50 microns, it offers all the benefits of a monochrome LCD that have been mentioned in the article. It is a good printer but nothing out of the ordinary.
However, the versatile display options allow the printer to support any screen between 8.9 and 10.1 inches and can utilize Epax's 10.1-inch 5K resolution display, giving you a print resolution of 45 microns in exchange for a larger print area of 216 x 135 mm, or even Epax's new 10.1-inch panel with 8K resolution, which delivers a resolution of 7680 x 4320 pixels and a pixel size of 28.5 microns. Quite out of the ordinary we'd say. Of course, if you don't currently have an E10 you can skip the upgrades and go straight for an E10 with 5K or 8K resolution.
Elegoo Jupiter
The Jupiter is one of Elegoo's largest printers, with a build volume of 277 x 156 x 300 mm. The 277 x 156 print area is supported by a 12.8 inch monochrome LCD screen, with a 6K resolution of 5448 x 3064 pixels the Jupiter can print at a resolution (XY) of 51 microns, printing the same level of detail as the Saturn but with almost 3 times the build volume.
The Jupiter brings an interesting addition to its specifications with the automatic resin feeding system, with a special screw cap for resin bottles, which allows you to put them upside down in an extension of the resin tank so you will never run out of resin again. Unlike other printers in the article the Jupiter's stock slicer options made it possible for us to get fast prints even with a completely full print bed.
Phrozen Sonic Mega 8K
The Phrozen Sonic Mega 8K is, in our minds, currently the pinnacle of large resin 3D printers and our favorite choice, even over the Photon Mono X. With its massive build volume, impressive resolution and ultra-competitive price, the Mega 8K will be more than a game changer for the large resin printer sector. If you need to print extra large without spending a fortune for the privilege then the Mega 8K should be at the top of your list.
With a build volume of 330 x 185 x 400 mm, it offers one of the largest volumes in commercial resin 3D printers, but it doesn't stop there. While there are a couple of printers of similar dimensions the Mega 8K emphasizes its print resolution with its monochrome LCD display with 8K resolution, a pioneer with its 7680 x 4320 pixels arranged on 15 inches of screen, the resolution it gives us is 43 microns. This is almost double what you could get with its competition. In other words, there is no need to compromise between large size and a high level of detail.
Peopoly Phenom Prime
The Peopoly Phenom Prime is the successor to the Phenom, boasting a 12.5-inch 5K monochrome LCD display that enables fast prints with a resolution (XY) of 51 microns in its 275 x 155 x 400 mm print volume. There is even a larger variant, the Phenom XXL, which offers a build volume of 527 x 296 x 550 mm, albeit with a resolution (XY) of 137 microns.
Peopoly has improved its noise level over its predecessor, the Phenom, by including a newly designed cooling system that reduces the noise level while dissipating the heat produced during printing. With the release of the Mega 8K and the Elegoo Jupiter, it becomes difficult to pay for the Phenom Prime for higher granularity and less print volume, yet it is still an excellent printer.
Phrozen Transform
The Phrozen Transform stands out in the low-budget resin 3D printer sector for its main feature, its changeable LCD panel. The entry-level model features a 13.3-inch RGB LCD display and 4K resolution, capable of producing prints with a resolution (XY) of 74 microns on its 290 x 160 mm build bed. Together with a Z-axis height of 400 mm, the Transform is certainly capable of making prints of considerable size.
Living up to its name, users can opt to change the dual LCD panel with two 5.5-inch LCD displays and an XY resolution of 47 microns. In addition, the manufacturer says the printer is equipped with a special connector that allows the LCD panels to be changed in as little as 30 seconds.
With monochrome displays and fast cure times becoming the norm, Phrozen has introduced new LCD panels to enhance the printer. There is a 13.9-inch 4K monochrome LCD panel, which allows you to increase print speed from 10 mm/h to 50 mm/h, as well as extending the life of the printer. And if that's not enough, the Transform can be equipped with an 8.9-inch 4K monochrome LCD panel which, while reducing the build area to 190 x 120, provides a resolution (XY) of 50 microns.
Where most resin 3D printers whether LCD or DLP are confined to a single panel size, the ability to switch between multiple options makes the Phrozen Transform distinct from other resin 3D printers in the low-budget sector.

Whether a user belongs to a company or is a self-employed professional who wants to invoice in this constantly evolving market, choosing a good approach to action can be the difference between the success and failure of your investment.
Here are 5 tips on how to enter this market by standing out from the competition:
Be creative:
Creativity is the main point for anyone who wants to make money in this market. Keeping up with market trends is another key to raising the billing ceiling by dedicating yourself to 3D printing.
Give training courses:
Being a relatively new technology on the market, 3D printing courses are scarce. Betting on making video courses and marketing them online, or offering face-to-face courses are also an excellent way to earn income with knowledge about 3D printing.
Learn to model and create your own 3D models:
Learning to use Blender or similar software is something almost mandatory in this sector, since that way you can create your own models and sell them printed in 3D or the models themselves online on websites like TurboSquid and CGTrader.
Promote your products on social networks:
Publicize your work. As ""a picture is worth a thousand words"", social networks like Pinterest or Instagram are ideal for promoting your business by posting eye-catching images of your models. In addition, by reaching a good number of followers, it is possible to sell your models and your courses through these channels.
Choose a market niche:
Choosing a niche market and specializing within the 3D printing market, instead of ""making and selling a bit of everything"", can be the key to success in this sector. The possibilities are very diverse and range from the sale of Action Figures to drone accessories.
Do not pigeonhole yourself in manufacturing:
In 3D printing, not only the people who manufacture the parts participate. Suppliers of consumables and spare parts also have an important role. If you know how to do maintenance you can also participate, if you know design too. The point is not to close yourself to the possibilities and the acquired knowledge.
· Maintenance:
Users who can maintain a 3D printer will be able to buy a cheaper printer, knowing what parts need to be changed and how to operate the printer. It is important to mention that a more expensive printer does not prevent the eventual maintenance of the equipment, and that it will not be a fully automated printer that with the push of a button will do all the work, although it does make the printing process a little easier.
If you are thinking of investing in a different business, trust the new technology sector. These have enabled the emergence of different job opportunities, which years ago would be unthinkable. The 3D revolution has generated a multitude of creative industries that play with the perception of the human eye, as in the case of cinemas. However, when reality surpasses fiction, 3D printers emerge, capable not only of simulating, but of materializing a part of reality. Now companies from different sectors can manufacture all kinds of objects in a different, profitable and useful way.
These are the main business models focused on 3D printing:
· Advisor, distributor or/and consultant for 3D printers:
This sector is relatively new, so if you train and become an expert, you will have a very profitable business. Taking into account that many companies require assistance to know both the operation and maintenance of them. You can combine this with the task of distributor, offering a complete service to the client.
· Design and production of personalized 3D products:
Today the world of customization is one of the most profitable. People need to know that you have an exclusive product. Take advantage of it, offering this service. Also, aside from personal use, many companies will ask you to print their projects.
· Sale of a specific product manufactured with 3D printing:
You can also develop a specific business idea, and sell that specific product. Find a need focused on any sector and exploit it.
Drone manufacturer and/or distributor:
Currently, these aircraft can be used in various cases, with an AESA authorization, you can specialize in their manufacture according to the sector. For example: hospitals and security forces can use them.
· Special repairs:
Sometimes we need parts to repair a device that are already discontinued.
· 3D model designer:
3D design continues to be a highly demanded market as many companies and organizations need new designs and improvements to their prototypes. Medium and large companies usually have in-house 3D designers, but small companies may require the services of a freelance designer.
· Maintenance and repair service for 3D printers:
3D printers are machines confirmed by many electromechanical parts and electronic components. At some point, one of the components may malfunction and servicing and repair services may be required.
On the other hand, the calibration task can be somewhat complicated at first, especially if you are a beginner.
You can take advantage of the opportunity to offer your services and cover this demand for 3D printer calibration and maintenance services. For them, you must have technical knowledge about the operation of the different brands and models and have expertise in detecting 3D printer failures.
You can also choose to subcontract specialist technical personnel to carry out calibration and maintenance tasks.
· Resale of 3D printers, materials and spare parts:
The classic method of reselling products also applies in this world. You can take advantage of the offers of AliExpress, free market and Amazon and then resell your products in a physical or virtual store.
Black Fridays or Christmas sales are good opportunities to complete stock and resell during the first half of the year.
Dropshiping is a good option that has become very popular nowadays. You just have to contact a manufacturer of one of the products and take care of all the sales management of said products.
· Printing of 3D objects on request:
One of the most common ways to generate income with a 3D printer is by printing objects at the request of clients. You receive the STL file of the three-dimensional model, load it into your Slicer program, configure the parameters of your 3D printer, place the required supports and start printing.
Under this concept, you are not responsible for the 3D design since the clients deliver it to you ready to print.
The printer and the printing material is within the costs of your work.
You could also offer your services online with systems similar to Cubify, materialize or shapeways. These companies receive the model in an stl file and print it with different types of materials and with different combinations that you request.
· Development of own products:
3D printing is an additive manufacturing process. That is, you can make things using your 3D printer and then sell them to a target audience.
At home, with 3D resin printers you can create dental prostheses, jewelry, hearing aids or decorative pieces. The FFF 3D printer is suitable for creating more resistant and functional plastic objects and parts.
Once you know how to design and craft these items, you can trade them using Amazon, Free Market, Gearbeast, etc.
· Manufacture and sale of Open source 3D Printers:
One of the revolutions in 3D printing occurred when Open source 3D printers were born with the RepRap project. Now everyone has free access to the plans and firmware of a DIY filament printer and everyone can make the modifications and improvements they deem necessary.
Best of all, the new printers that result from these improvements can be legally marketed.
You too can get on the ship and start making new DIY FDM printers and be a supplier in your city and country.
· Develop 3D Printing programs:
If you are a programmer and you know about 3D printing, you can combine this knowledge and create digital tools to meet the needs of the market at certain stages of the process.
I am not talking about creating a Blender or a simplify3D (unless you have your own company and have the resources to do it), but about small programs that are useful and that you can then commercialize in the medium or long term.
Many programmers have started their projects with small applications that have been improved over time. Obviously programming knowledge is necessary.
You can also choose to hire programmers to make the program. Today there are many freelancers who can offer you their services for competitive prices.
Provide some online service associated with 3D printing:
As 3D printing technologies evolve, we become more connected and continue to take things to new levels.
These advances are achieved thanks to the development of new tools and services that facilitate certain stages of the process. For example, today you can go to Thingiverse and download a print-ready 3D model, then you can mail that model or some file-sharing service to a print service provider, and then pick it up when it's printed.
In that process, you don't need to know 3D design, you don't need to have a design program installed, and you don't need to have a 3D printer. You just need to have internet.
Although this is an extreme case, it is totally real and possible to do today.
In any area of the 3D printer it is possible to create new elements that make things even easier and provide benefits that serve the users.
· Manufacturer of 3D printing materials:
3D printers need materials for the development of parts. Filaments, resins, powders, etc. are required. The provision of materials is a sector in constant growth both in sales and in competition.
Every day manufacturers look for new ways to improve their products. They make more flexible and less polluting filaments, they create resins for all kinds of uses, and thus, they cover more and more sectors that demand products. More and more sectors can take advantage of 3D printing.
Now you have the opportunity to be part of that group of companies that manufacture materials for 3D printers.
· 3D printing focused on construction:
Large 3D printers and programs for housing construction have been developed, whose technological development promises enormous benefits to cover decent housing needs at lower costs and in incredibly short times. In addition, they can be developed with personalized characteristics since it will be enough to change the architectural design in a CAD program to build a home according to the taste and needs of each client.
Projects have already been developed that are in the testing stage, for example, in China they are being used for offices so that once they have been verified, they will begin to be used on a large scale. On the internet you will find information and videos that explain the construction method. The most significant savings are in labor and materials, using concrete and recycled materials.
Technologies are also being developed for architectural finishes that would take years to develop using traditional methods and that with 3D printing will be a matter of months or days. Likewise, there are technologies for 3D printing of ornamental elements such as benches, fountains, pilasters, etc.
· 3D printing focused on the health sector:
The health field is always one of the first sectors to benefit from technological development and 3D printing is no exception. There are already many start-ups that are exploring the possibilities of this type of printing applied to health. Printing of splints, prostheses, implants...
3D printing fits so well in the world of health because each product can be fully customized, with the specific measurements and characteristics of each patient, the same implant or splint is not suitable for two different patients, no matter how similar their needs. Here it is good to emphasize that the areas where 3D printers add more value are those that require a high degree of customization.
But if we also want to delve into what until now was fertile ground for science fiction, the possibilities are incredible: printing of drugs and printing of tissues and organs are some of the options that are already being investigated. Of course, although this type of technology and business may still be a long way from an SME, technology is advancing so fast that no option can be ruled out, there are also opportunities with simpler elements, we can say that in the world There are over 3 million 3D printed hearing aids out there, and using 3D printing to create dental crowns is already an everyday occurrence for many dentists. These are two examples that clearly demonstrate the advantages: Before, to produce the prosthesis, the doctor took an impression with wax and then, based on this mold, the crown or hearing aid was produced. It was an expensive, slow and imprecise process. Today, the dentist scans the broken tooth, corrects it digitally if necessary, and sends it for printing. The whole process takes a couple of hours instead of taking weeks, as it used to be. In addition, the prosthesis is naturally much more comfortable because it has a very precise shape, the exact shape of your tooth or your ear.
Taking into account the main tips and models to start a business around 3D printing, the idea way to carry it out will be by following these steps.
The first step, therefore, is to consider these technologies as tools with diverse capacities and functions, whose applications in each specific industry will help us to find a first position in the market and, also, to identify potential clients of greater value to whom to offer. different production, research or prototyping solutions.
The second step is the choice of the ideal technology or technologies, it will depend on the production needs that we have and our business environment, since if we are, for example, in an area where the majority of our potential clients belong to the of metallurgy, it will be of little use that we are going to offer them a team that manufactures objects from thermo-plastic materials; and, if we do, we must know specifically what are the real uses that can be given to that equipment and its limitations.
80% of current 3D printing companies and businesses base their catalog of products and services on FDM manufacturing technology, which is affordable given the cost of this equipment compared to other printing techniques.
However, having a single technology turns out to be a great impediment when it comes to offering equipment or manufacturing on demand, since, sooner or later, we will find ourselves with the problem of not being able to serve potential clients who require other properties. physical mechanics and aesthetics.
Bearing all this in mind, the most important thing before starting will be to analyze our business environment and the possibilities it offers, without confusing our potential scope with the specific physical environment of the area where we live, since there are infinite options for performing online services. or it may even be interesting to move to more favorable areas.
The third step is to be constantly updated with information, in a technological sector such as 3D printing, new advances appear every day of which we must be well informed, because we have to take into account that our competition will be, and above all because There is no worse feeling than going to visit a possible client, and that he knows more about a technology, equipment or material than you.
But as we well know, most of the information we find will have been directed or focused by a printer manufacturer who will tell us how great their technology is and how great its advantages are.
Therefore, it is crucial to have accurate information about the real capabilities of one or another piece of equipment and its possible drawbacks, since our role is to become the reference informative, in such a way that they can fully trust that the equipment or solution that we indicate will be the best option for their company.
As a fourth step we must focus on a model, when we talked about the ideal technology, there is no solution that can meet the needs of all companies in this sector, so we need a business partner that provides us access to any technology of additive manufacturing, providing us with the appropriate training, material and infrastructure to be able to meet the needs of each client safely, thus avoiding costly errors that can affect the viability of our project.
One of the advantages with which this distributor starts is that it offers a wide coverage of advice, training and distribution of the main brands of professional and industrial 3D printing on the market, thus not having to choose exclusively between the solutions offered by one or the other. , but allowing us to access the most optimized solution for each sector.
But when it comes to applying 3D printing solutions to our potential clients, it is not only enough to have a detailed knowledge of the characteristics and possibilities of the various products available, but also the technical knowledge of each of the industrial areas in which we will apply our products: what processes can be improved, in what phase of production is it more profitable to implement them, what balances of investment and cost savings entails, etc. All of this applied to the sector in which we are targeting, to apply already existing solutions of high profitability, such as the medical, metallurgical, aeronautical, automotive, jewelry, toy manufacturing, or any other industrial sector. Well, each one requires completely different characteristics and development and implementation.
According to a study carried out by Markets and Markets, the 3D printing market will move about 32.7 billion per year until 2023, growing about 25% annually. Without a doubt, these figures are excellent and open doors for a series of improvements, improvements and innovations within this area, considering that it is a growing technology and that it is still far from its peak.
If you are thinking of betting on 3D printing, the best time to start is now, while the market is not yet well established. Thus, by learning and putting into practice the innovations that are emerging, you will be able to take advantage of the maximum present and future potential of this technology that will revolutionize many sectors.

The 3D printing market has grown exponentially during the last years, which has allowed the variety of materials and technologies to expand likewise. We’ll then discuss the common materials and their characteristics.
Filaments: filaments are the most popular materials in the 3D printing world due to its low cost, easiness of printing and versatility. For the printing with filaments, the most common technique is FDM that refers to plastic extrusion, however, the majority of printed parts with this technology are destined to prototyping. Other technologies that can be printed with plastic are Material Jetting and Multi Jet Fusion. The most common filaments are PLA, ABS and PETG.
PLA is a thermoplastic filament biodegradable that is extruded at an average temperature between 160 °C and 220 °C. This material emits odors when extruded, but, contrary to ABS, these are not toxic gasses to the user. It's considered an adequate material when you’re beginning in 3D printing due to its low cost and behavior during printing.
ABS is an affordable material, but for high quality printing, it’s necessary to include accessories to the printer, such as heated beds, an enclosed printing chamber and even a fume hood if it’s printed in poorly ventilated rooms, due to that some of the gasses that this material emits are toxic. The spool with the material needs to be stored properly in hermetically sealed containers in order to assure its properties, this is because the material it’s sensitive to humidity. It has an extruding temperature between 230 °C and 260 °C.
On its part, PET can be used in 3D printing, however, for this task it needs to be modified with glycol, which is known as PETG. This changes the material composition, it allows to obtain clearer finishes and less brittle. This material has high impact resistance, it’s flexible, resistant and can sustain moderate mechanical stresses. It’s commonly used for food grade applications.
Special filaments:
There can be found materials such as TPE, which stand out for their flexibility and elasticity. TPU filament it’s a variant that offers flexibility properties that are similar to rubber but modified to be more manageable for printing. Another variant available to use it’s TPC, which stands out for its resistance to chemical treatments and UV rays.
Nylon on its part, it’s a versatile filament that it’s commonly found in deep white color, it’s recommended a printing temperature of between 235 °C and 260 °C. Vapors emitted during Nylon printing don't present risks to health. Its specific properties vary depending on the type of Nylon used, it can be found, for example, that Nylon 645 it’s stronger than Nylon 618.
HIPS and PVA filaments are plastics commonly used for support due to their solubility in various substances. HIPS it’s the commonly used, specially for printing with ABS, due to its ease to be dissolved in limonene. In a period of 24 hours the part can become free of supports without requiring sanding or manual removal to improve part quality. For its part, PVA is water soluble, which makes it practical, but it’s not easy to handle it and deteriorate quickly.
M Aerospace RTC works with a variety of ABS filaments. In turn, we have available other polymers such as Nylon, Polycarbonate, Ultem and other rigid plastics, flexibles and light curables. Finally, we have a great variety of rubbers. We encourage you to contact us to obtain more information about the materials and process we have.
Powders: printers that use powder to build parts melt the powder and distribute it layer by layer until obtaining the thickness, texture and patterns desired. Among the most common non-metallic powders used are:
Polyamide: It’s a polymer made from many amide bonds, it’s biocompatible due to being made from materials such as corn starch and can be used in food grade applications and non alcoholic beverages.
Alumide: It’s a mixture between polyamide and aluminum powder, it’s a material which makes parts with great thermal resistance, but it needs post-processing. Alumide it’s used for complex parts, due to the printing technique having few geometrical limitations.
Resins: Resins are materials sensitive to UV rays that make them solidify using a light source. Parts made with these materials have great quality of details and smoothness. Common resin has properties similar to ABS, however, the mechanical properties it has are lower. It can be divided in two groups:
Standard resin: It has properties similar to ABS, good surface finish and moderate mechanical properties. It’s used in general use printings or for fast printings.
Advanced resins: Its main characteristic it’s that it offers functional mechanical properties. The main applications for this type of resin are engineering and dental.
Metals: Metals in 3D printing are the second most popular group in the industry due to the fact that this technology allows metallic parts that have designs up to 30 times lighter at the same time allowing less material waste. For metal parts it’s used DMLS (Direct Metal Laser Sintering) technology based in metallic powder, which allows end-use parts, however, the majority of parts need thermal post processing. M Aerospace RTC works with aluminum, stainless steel, bronze, gold among other materials.
In the same way, there exist metallic alloys, which work with a different technology called Binder Jetting. This technology uses a great variety of ceramics, polymers, sand and metals. Our company has available stainless steels such as 420 and 316, titanium and copper to work with this technique. If you need other material or require more information, please contact us with questions to give you the best attention.

In this article, metal powders and filaments used in additive manufacturing will be discussed in a non-exhaustive manner. Powders are the predominant material used in most additive manufacturing systems. On a small scale, filaments are used in DED (Directed Energy Deposition), foils in SL (Stereolithography), and metal particles in suspensions are used in ME (Material Extrusion) and MJ (Material Jetting).
Only a small fraction of the alloys available for conventional manufacturing methods have been optimized for additive manufacturing applications. The high sensitivity of additive manufacturing technologies to process parameters and the unique microstructure and properties of parts manufactured by additive manufacturing require the development of optimized process recipes and process property databases for many new alloys that could be suitable for additive manufacturing processes.
Most of the development in materials for metal additive manufacturing has been focused on ferrous and titanium alloys, followed by aluminum alloys, nickel and cobalt-chromium superalloys. Additive manufacturing of refractory metals (e.g. molybdenum and its alloys), precious metals (e.g. gold, silver, platinum, tantalum, etc.), tungsten, magnesium, copper, and intermetallic materials have been investigated by both academia and industry. The development of metal powders (and other forms) oriented to the various additive manufacturing processes is an active field of research. Growth is expected as additive manufacturing applications increase.

Given the numerous ferrous alloys such as stainless steels, tool steels, maraging steels, etc., employing them in additive manufacturing processes has always been at the forefront of R&D efforts. In a review of ferrous alloys used in additive manufacturing, the majority of paper publications are attributed to the PBF (Powder Bed Fusion) process (68% for LPBF (Laser Powder Bed Fusion) and 1% EB-PBF (Electron Beam Powder Bed Fusion) ), followed by LDED (Laser Directed Energy Deposition) (28%) and BJ (Binder Jetting) (3%), indicating the high popularity of PBF technology for additive manufacturing of metals. Among various ferrous alloys, 316L stainless steel, 300 martensitic stainless steel, H13 tool steel, 17-4 PH stainless steel, M2 tool steel, P20 tool steel, and 304L stainless steel stand out as the most studied alloys. The EB-PBF (Electron Beam Powder Bed Fusion) process has worked ferrous alloys in a reduced way, limited to H13 tool steel and 316L stainless steel. Applications such as the fabrication of porous biomedical implants, shaped cooling channels, tooling and lattice structures have been reported for ferrous alloys in additive manufacturing.
Titanium Alloys

Titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V is the most studied alloy in metal additive manufacturing processes. Titanium alloys that feature unique properties such as biocompatibility, high strength while being lightweight and high corrosion resistance have extensive applications in the biomedical and aerospace industries. Being available in powder and filament form, all three main categories of additive manufacturing (PBF, DED, BJ) can use titanium alloys as raw material. Titanium is well suited for additive manufacturing because of its difficult and expensive machining. In addition to Ti-6Al-4V alloy and pure titanium, other alloys of interest for additive manufacturing include Ti-24Nb-4Zr-8Sn, Ti-6Al-7Nb, and Ti-6.5Al-3.5Mo-1.5Zr-0.3Si. Even Ti-6Al-4V, Ti-48Al-2Nb-0.7Cr-0.3Si, γ-TiAl, and Ti-24Nb-4Zr-8Sn alloys have been used in EB-PBF.
Nickel Alloys

Nickel superalloys are another category of materials that have gained the attention of the additive manufacturing community for their excellent resistance to extreme conditions and high temperatures. These properties and the freedom of design and optimization that additive manufacturing offers provide a great combination for creative innovations in the aerospace, aerospace, aerospace, and tooling industries. Inconel alloys make up the majority of the nickel alloy R&D effort in additive manufacturing, with Inconel 718 and Inconel 625 being the most studied materials in this category followed by Hastelloy X as another popular alloy in this category for additive manufacturing.
Aluminum Alloys

Aluminum is a lightweight material with high thermal and electrical conductivity, high ductility and high corrosion resistance with applications in multiple industries such as aerospace, construction, and automotive. The weldability of an alloy is a good indicator of its compatibility with additive manufacturing processes. Aluminum alloys are not very weldable but are easy to machine. In addition, they have demonstrated low processability with lasers due to their high reflectivity and low viscosity in the melt phase. As a result, aluminum has not been a material of interest in additive manufacturing research compared to other alloy groups such as titanium, nickel and iron.
However, given the benefits that additive manufacturing of aluminum offers, such as lightweight structures for aviation, there have been increasing efforts to optimize the processing parameters in the PBF and DED processes. So far the main aluminum alloy used in manufacturing has been AlSi10Mg; however, the possibility of printing AlSi12, AlSi9Mg, AlSi7Mg0.3 and AlSiMg0.75 has been demonstrated. Al-Cu and Al-Sc filaments have been used with the EB-DED process.
Precious Metals

In the case of precious metal 3D printing there are 2 approaches, direct manufacturing and indirect manufacturing. Indirect manufacturing refers to the fabrication of a pattern that is then used to make a function mold, this roughly speaking. While in the case of direct manufacturing we refer to the fabrication of the final part from a reference model, we are going to focus on the latter for this section.
Precious metals are used in additive manufacturing due to their special properties. In addition to the jewelry industry, they are also important in the biomedical industry for the manufacture of implants due to their good biocompatibility. Their outstanding physical properties, such as high strength even at high temperatures and stable behavior at fluctuating temperatures, give them a predestined place in the aerospace industry. The precious metals used are the so-called noble metals among which platinum (Pt), Rhodium (Rh), Iridium (Ir), Palladium (Pd), Silver (Ag) and Gold (Au) as well as some customized alloys such as PtRh20, PtIr50, Sterling Silver (or .925 Sterling Silver) and Red Gold. They are usually processed by additive manufacturing printers using EBM (Electron Beam Melting) and SLM (Selective Laser Melting) processes."
https://www.maerospacertc.com/post/post-processing-methods-to-clean-and-prep-your-3d-prints,"Post-Processing Methods to Clean and Prep Your 3D Prints
Maybe you've printed something that has great bones, but you imagined a finished project with fine details and a different aesthetic than you currently have on your new 3D print. While you may be tempted to start directly to alter the appearance of your print, there are a few essential steps for post-processing 3D prints you should apply before you begin with the finishing touches. Not only will these methods provide a good base so that you can seamlessly apply the finer details, but they can also improve your print's strength and overall post-process quality.
Let's take a deeper look at cleaning up 3D prints to prepare them for finishing.
Removing Supports
If your print has insoluble supports (made of the same material as the central part), you must remove them manually. Often it will be possible to snap the supports off with your fingers, but if they are in a difficult-to-reach spot, try employing a pair of needle nose pliers to cut them away.
Soluble supports, on the other hand, may be simply dissolved, leaving virtually no trace of where they once were present. The two most-used soluble support materials are HIPS and PVA for those fortunate enough to use a dual-extruder 3D printer. PVA works great for PLA prints and dissolves readily in water. Likewise, d-limonene dissolves HIPS, which is your go-to choice for ABS.
Sanding
There are a few crucial points to remember when you're first learning how to smooth out 3D prints. First, sanding resin prints is the best way to prepare for later painting and polishing printed components, and although it can take some time, the finished product you will gain will be well worth the labor involved in 3D print smoothing.
First, use circular movements with lower-grit sandpaper (150-400) to start. Next, make several passes over the surface you are smoothing, using finer-grit sandpaper (up to 2,000) each time. The circular motion is critical with FDM parts because a back-and-forth motion could damage the appearance of the visible layers.
If your print has fine details or heat-sensitive filaments, use water to absorb any heat you generate with the sanding. Just dip the part in water and sand as before. This will prevent damage and keep the part cool.
Welding
In your journey to creating larger, complex objects using ABS, welding with acetone is a sturdy and inexpensive method for joining multiple ABS parts. This is a great and straightforward workaround when your printer's build volume is limited.
Apply a small dab of acetone onto one of the parts you want to attach. Use sparingly, or the entire part can be damaged or ruined.
The plastic will melt briefly, and you can attach the other part securely by holding them together for a few moments to let them set.
This method only works with ABS, and the weld will always be the weak link in your object, but this is an inexpensive and easy solution to keep in mind for your projects.
Gluing
If you use materials other than ABS for your prints, glue such as super glue or products like 3D Gloop! are easy to use for the same purpose as acetone welding. When finishing PLA prints or PETG prints, glue works very well to get around the size constraints of your printer.
Now your print is ready for the final touches of finishing! The extra time spent on the techniques described in this article will be visible in the excellent quality of your finished print."
https://www.maerospacertc.com/post/powder-waste-management,"Powder waste management
Additive manufacturing processes are distinguished by the type of raw material they require. The most widespread processes, such as FDM and SLA, use filaments and resins, respectively, as raw materials. These raw materials have their challenges when handled to avoid health hazards. But their risks are miniscule when compared to another type of raw material, powders. Metal powders, plastic powders and composite powders are available. Dusts are used as raw materials in SLS, DMLS, MJF and other processes. The following will outline the risks involved in handling powders as well as strategies to minimize them as much as possible.
Potential health hazards
What are the potential hazards associated with dusts in additive manufacturing?
Breathing and being in contact with dusts (especially metallic)
Skin contact may lead to irritation or allergic reactions (e.g. dermatitis)
Eye contact may result in mechanical irritation and cause damage
Inhalation of dusts may result in respiratory problems
Risk of fire, explosions, implosions due to static electricity
High-power lasers
The location of the printer, the use of dielectric protective equipment and the procedures for the reception and disposal of dusts must be taken into account.
Exposure during work activities
In order to correctly determine the risk to which the operators are exposed it is necessary to ask the following questions: Are the work activities likely to generate exposure to dusts, how are these dusts handled, how likely is exposure, can the way the activity is carried out be changed to reduce exposure (from high exposure to low exposure), and finally, be aware of other printing activities in the vicinity. To facilitate these questions, we have provided a table showing the activities involved in the various stages of printing and the exposure risk associated with them.
Process controls
Workplace recommendations
In general, the following is recommended:
Print in an enclosure with negative pressure and a dedicated ventilation system, in an area away from other work
An adequate fire protection system
Work policies
It is necessary to consider the current policies, as it is important to be prepared for the management of waste generated by 3D printing processes that use powders as raw material, as well as to have a plan for dust spill situations in the workplace, the following recommendations are offered, applicable to all stages of printing:
Incorporate additive manufacturing powders into workplace safety programs
Develop standardized operating procedures
Avoid consuming beverages and food in the work area
Restrict access to the work area to essential personnel only
Properly handles filters during replacement, removal and disposal, and checks and replaces seals when necessary
Use signs to warn workers of hazards and the actions they should take to protect themselves
Consider the reactivity of your raw material when choosing cleaning agents, equipment and methods
Clean work areas frequently, between printouts and at least once a day
Use wet cleaning methods (avoid using dry cloths or compressed air)
Ensure the handling and disposal of all materials (including PPE and cleaning materials) according to applicable regulations
Personal protective equipment
If all the above points are not sufficient to mitigate the risk of exposure, then what protective equipment to use, have you taken into account other risks, such as fire, static, explosions and lasers?
Always wear the appropriate PPE for the activities around you (e.g., if a dust change is taking place next to your workstation, you should wear the same level of PPE protection). While dust exposure levels during the printing stage are the lowest, work surfaces can become contaminated with dust. If printing is interrupted, it is necessary to wear appropriate protective equipment while the printer is open.
It is advisable to follow PPE replacement practices and not to use PPE outside the work area, the following PPE recommendations are applicable for all stages of printing:
Nitrile or chemically resistant gloves
Lab coats or coveralls
Safety goggles or face shields
Respirators for exposure mitigation
Safety Data Sheets
As a last point to discuss, as there are a variety of raw materials it is not possible to discuss them in this article, but as it is vitally important to know, we will explain below, all materials have a Safety Data Sheet (SDS). Broadly speaking, these sheets are documents that indicate the particularities and properties of each substance for its most appropriate use. Their purpose, therefore, is to protect the integrity of the person handling a particular material. That is why, before applying any of the points exposed in the article, you should search for all the data sheets of the materials involved in your additive manufacturing processes with powders.
As you can see, there are a multitude of measures that can be taken to protect operators from the hazards of working with powders, especially when it comes to additive manufacturing. Hopefully, you will be able to implement most of these measures and thus achieve a safe and efficient working environment."
https://www.maerospacertc.com/post/profitability-of-additive-manufacturing,"Profitability of Additive Manufacturing.
For the first three decades, 3D printers were limited by their complexity and cost to large companies and service bureaus. In the early 2010s, hundreds of companies entered the market and flooded it with 3D printers due to more advanced software, expired patents, and technology maturation. A bubble quickly appeared.
The first technology available for desktop use was Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). 3D printers that selectively melt and deposit plastic became affordable for consumers, but their capabilities were limited. Excitement over the emergence quickly turned to disappointment, and the dream that 3D printers would become essential tools in every home never materialized.
However, aside from the volatile consumer 3D printer market, additive manufacturing technologies will continue to advance rapidly. Printers geared toward professionals for use in engineering, prototyping, and manufacturing began to cross critical markers for quality, reliability, and cost.
The second technology to become available in a more affordable, compact, and easy-to-use format was stereolithography (SLA). Professional printers costing $80,000 were found on the market for as much as $3,300. With a wide range of materials, the development of the technology expanded the use of 3D printing into the fields of product design and engineering, as well as the dentistry and jewelry industries.
The third wave of 3D printers available for desktop use was based on Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) technology, which has been an essential technology for industrial use. Unlike other technologies available in desktop formats, SLS creates exceptionally strong parts from thermoplastics, such as nylon, that is nearly as strong as their injection-molded or injection-molded counterparts.
In 2016, the lowest priced SLS printer was around $200,000 (with some reaching several million dollars). In 2019, Benchtop SLS printers had an SLS printer in the $10,000 range.
The 3D printer hasn't become the appliance its most avid enthusiasts predicted as of 2010, but it is blazing a trail in mass markets. While the creation of CAD files is still the domain of trained and capable technicians, consumer-friendly 3D printing has been put to good use in schools. Finally, although most people are not printing their own 3D objects, the number of products manufactured with this technology is growing every year.
Creative culture.
In the last fifteen years or so, an interest in taking things apart (and possibly voiding the warranty) has resurfaced, as well as creating things at home or school. At a time when workshop classes in US schools fell in popularity, in part because the schools themselves emphasized more pre-college education, a “maker culture” emerged. This culture has flourished for many reasons:
· The possibility of creating physical products (whether scarves, robots, or decorative items) gives a feeling of achievement, which abstract symbolic analysis and manipulation cannot.
· Computers have declined in importance, and instead smartphones, tablets, and other tools have brought computing into everyday life instead of isolating it in a box or on a desk.
· The same impulse that gave birth to the culture of ""hot rod"" cars in the '60s and '70s can find expression, not in cars (which are much less intuitive to modify at the hardware level due to all the computational control systems) but if in the modification of drones, home brewing, and even life sciences (as in the field of DIY).
· Both crowdsourcing and crowdfunding allow users to bring their creations to the market and allow small-scale creators to find audiences for unique products like on Etsy.
The open source ethic has influenced many creators to adopt a similar attitude towards hardware knowledge and design: plans and advice are available, often in video format, making it easy for people to learn new skills or be inspired with intelligent thought.
·Physical instances of this culture, be it “maker spaces” or maker conventions (which draw thousands of people), contribute to the vibrancy of ideas and resources online.
Rep Rap Project.
The RepRap project began in England in 2005 as an initiative by the University of Bath to develop a low-cost printer that can print most of its own components, but is today made up of millions of contributors around the world. RepRap derives from Replicating Rapid Prototype.
Due to the machine's ability to create some of its own parts, the authors envisioned the possibility of cheap RepRap units, allowing the manufacture of complex products without the need for extensive industrial infrastructure. They tried to get RepRap to demonstrate the evolution of this process as well as its exponentially increasing numbers. A preliminary study concluded that using RepRaps to print common products resulted in cost savings.
Why use Additive Manufacturing?
Using traditional or conventional technologies such as machining or injection molding has many advantages. All subtractive techniques can achieve a mirror-like finish and can detail to within microns of tolerance in almost any material available. Injection molding can be time-consuming to set up, but once it is done, the production volume (productions of parts per unit time) will be very high, which is commonly the only way to reach mass production.
But the industrial challenges become more and more complicated, to a level that sometimes the necessary geometry cannot be achieved with conventional techniques. Sometimes this happens because of the accessibility of the tool or because the mold has to be opened to pick up the part without damaging it, or simply because the production is too low (a single prototype) to be cost-effective and justify the cost of production. the tool needed to make it.
Those blunt limitations mentioned above could prevent a part from being manufactured in a lighter, more efficient way, or without the possibility of producing the necessary number of prototypes fast enough to iterate and improve it. In addition, the capabilities of traditional technologies, relative to cost, can be loosely summarized in a single picture, in which the opportunities linked to additive manufacturing appear:
Cost-effective opportunities (Green Area) for AM compared to conventional manufacturing.
In the image, you can see what is preferable to do with conventional manufacturing (CM) and what is economically more attractive to do with additive manufacturing (AM).
Looking at the number of parts produced in the traditional way, it is well known that the more identical the parts produced by the machine, the lower the cost of the batch will be. If the batch size is too low, the cost of the tool could become too expensive to produce, which can become unproductive. This is represented by the blue curve, with the dotted line being the limit.
In terms of geometric complexity related to the cost of conventional machining, the trend is more like the red curve. Low complexity means low cost, and if the part is too complex for the technology, the part becomes too expensive or it is not even possible to build the part for technical reasons.
Advantages of Additive Manufacturing.
Additive manufacturing can have many advantages:
· With the optimal design, much less material will be wasted compared to machining.
· Thanks to the layer-by-layer construction, access to the interior of the part becomes easily accessible, allowing the designer to create much more complex designs (internal cavities, lighter structures, channels…) than with conventional techniques.
· One-step manufacturing does not require the use of extra tools during the manufacturing phase. No special mold or apparatus is necessary to position the part on the machine.
· A wide range of materials is currently available in the form of polymers, metals, and ceramics.
· Vaguely, one could say that geometric complexity does not increase cost, in other words, making a very light part, made of a 3D grid, with integrated channels and hinges, would cost about the same as a cube with the same size and volume of material. This is not at all the case for conventional technologies.
· It becomes possible to produce different pieces (in size, and complexity.) at one time when instead a mold can only produce the article for which it was designed. Particularly of interest for medical applications such as custom implants.
· Some technologies can produce parts made of different materials in one go.
· Some functionalities (springs, hinges, gears, rotary axes…) can be added to the design to be manufactured. This would require no extra post-assembly work, instead, they would be integrated right out of the printer
· The time needed to produce a standard volume part (300 x 300 x 400 mm3) is usually less than a week from draft to CAD to a final ready-to-use part. Very convenient even for early iterative development of a product that is to be manufactured by injection molding.
· Customization, labeling, texturing, cooling channels, weight reduction…, they become much more.
Disadvantages of Additive Manufacturing.
But there are, of course, some limitations to be aware of:
· The best geometric accuracy that can be achieved is 0.1mm on standard AM machines, for a part smaller than 100mm. For larger parts, 0.1% should be considered. This value can even reach 0.3% depending on the material, technology, and part.
· The maximum part size limitation can prevent the designer from manufacturing large parts, such as car bumpers or tables, in a single print. On average today, the maximum size possible on industrial grade machines is approximately 800mm. But some non-standard techniques can create a sand mold with dimensions of 4,000 x 2,000 x 1,000 mm or even houses with concrete walls.
· Many Additive Manufacturing technologies require a support structure. Roughly speaking, this structure connects the built part to the built platform. This prevents parts from moving during manufacturing and keeps them secure. This support is built at the same time the part is built. Unfortunately, this structure has to be removed after manufacturing and therefore will require post-processing to remove the support structure.
· Right after manufacturing, in some technologies, raw material is found everywhere, around the entire part, inside cavities, crevices, channels… And if the design does not take these facts into consideration, this raw material can be very difficult to remove, especially in small spaces.
·Some techniques produce parts with anisotropic mechanical properties, especially on low-cost machines and at “great” layer thicknesses (> 100 µm). But for most technologies, this anisotropic feature is not strongly marked.
What determines the cost of a 3D printing service?
Capital is the cornerstone in deciding on the right 3D printing service. Therefore it is important to know the factors that determine the amount of capital needed to print or hire a printing service.
The cost of 3D printers
3D printers are available in the market with different technologies, features, and sophistication that affects their cost as well as the quality cost, and quantity of the parts to be printed.
3D printing is an additive technology that involves manufacturing a 3D model from a CAD model. However, as 3D printers operate based on different technologies, both the operating scheme, production speed, compatible materials, post-processing, and most importantly, the cost of printed parts, vary from model to model.
Among the different technologies used in 3D printing, some stand out when comparing their cost and print quality. One of these technologies is Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), which involves the construction of parts through the melting extrusion and deposition of thermoplastic filaments. FDM process 3D printers are the lowest cost printers available on the market. Another of these technologies is Stereolithography (SLA) which uses a laser to cure resin and convert it into hard plastic. This technology is expensive due to its high detail, precision, and versatility. Other of these technologies include Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), Selective Laser Melting (SLM), and Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), all of which cost more than other technologies due to their rarity.
Cost of setting up a 3D printer.
Setting up a 3D printer can be a difficult task if you do it yourself. This is why many people wanting to avoid damaging their printer resort to the help of technicians, although of course, this entails an extra cost.
There is no average cost of a 3D printer set up as the price varies depending on the experience of the technician and the sophistication of the printer. For example, for FDM process 3D printers, the setup cost is around $200-$1000.
Operating cost of a 3D printer
To answer the question, how much does it cost to print in 3D? It is important to know how much the operation of a 3D printer costs.
Let's say you decide to buy a $2,000 printer that you plan to use for 10 hours every day for 2 years. Now, ignoring the cost of repairs, maintenance and electricity, let's calculate
10 hours X 365 days X 2 years = 7300 hours
$2000 ÷ 7300 = ~$0.27/hr
With this simple calculation, we can conclude that the cost of running this $2,000 3D printer would be $0.27/hr. Related to this, a 3D model that takes 3 hours to print will cost approximately (0.27 x 3) $0.81
Therefore, knowing the cost of printing a 3D model is a determining factor in the cost of the 3D printing service.
· Maintenance cost
3D printers are capable of producing parts of the highest quality and definition, but without maintenance, their performance and print quality will decline. Like other machines, a 3D printer needs proper maintenance. However, this comes at a cost.
Maintenance costs comprise the cost of replacing the parts of a 3D printer and cleaning those parts. Depending on the parts and the sophistication of the printer, this could cost a few hundred dollars. For example, for an FDM printer, the maintenance cost varies from $200 to $500. If an expert is required, the cost will go up.
Material cost.
The number of materials available for 3D printing continues to increase as knowledge of the process continues to advance. This increases flexibility in manufacturing products, their features, and the cost of 3D printing parts. The effect of materials on 3D printed parts and their cost is profound, as their accessibility, rarity, etc. makes it an important factor. The most common materials used in 3D printing are:
Powder and filament.
Powder and filaments are the two cheapest types of material used in 3D printing. They are thermoplastic, meaning when melted they can be reshaped until the desired shape is achieved.
3D printing enthusiasts prefer to use these types of materials (commonly PLA and.
ABS) because they are low cost. For example, filaments can be found on the market starting at a price of $20 dollars per Kg. However, although cheap, using these materials in the production of parts that require high quality is difficult, since it is necessary to invest time and money in the perfection of models made with these materials.
Resins.
Resins are possibly the best material for 3D printing because they are easy to work with. Although, unlike powders and filaments, they are quite expensive. Therefore, working with them will certainly drive up the cost of the printed parts.
high-end materials.
The cost of a 3D printing service tends to rise when high-end materials are used. High-end materials are not easy to get because they are not common, making them more expensive. For example, working with metals such as titanium, cobalt, aluminum, nickel, and steel alloys. This is also partly because of the need for specialized technology like DMLS.
The size and complexity of a 3D model.
When designing parts to be 3D printed, a 3D model of the part is essential for accurate 3D printing, as the model provides the details needed for production. After getting the 3D model it is easier to estimate the cost of a 3D printed part or printing service.
The complexity and size of the model affect the final price of 3D printing. Complex designs may require more sophisticated printing technology and thus increase the cost of the part. Understanding the complexity and size of a 3D model will avoid wasting both capital and time."

There are many types of 3D printers, many types of materials with which we can print our objects. That's why he decided to create this 3D printing resin types article. To help you in the wonderful world of 3D printing so you don't go crazy on this path. Resin is a kind of material used for 3D printing with polymerization technology. It is formed from thermosetting polymers and its form is liquid. We understand as thermosetting polymers all those materials that have the form of a fluid but that can be cured and hardened until they become a solid object, thanks to light or heat. When we have the solid objects already created in the 3D printer, these objects cannot be melted back to the shape they had before.
Although it is true that a bad placement of this, it can seem to melt, and it is due to a bad placement of the holes of the model, leaving liquid resin inside.
When we buy a pot of resin, we can see that the bottles they are sold with are different. These bottles are specifically designed with UV protection, as the resin inside is sensitive to the sun's UV rays. To correctly choose the resin for our 3D printer, we must know the printer to know what type of resin our printer supports. We also have to take into account what UV wavelength is in the printer we have. The normal thing is that this standard value is 405 nanometers in length or These resins are the most used if we want to have a high-quality finish on our models, in addition to the fact that we can find this resin in four different colors. These colors are: gray, white, black and transparent.
Before handling any type of resin, you have to bear in mind that the use of masks for respiratory protection is of vital importance, in addition to the use of nitrile gloves at all times during the printing process, and especially when handling a piece of resin without prior curing.
What types of 3D Printer Resins are there? Among the types of Resins for 3D printer we can find:
-Standard resin.
-Dental resins.
-Biocompatible Resins.
-Flexible Resins.
-Industrial resins.
-High Temperature Resistant Resins.
-Castable resins.
-Water washable resins.
Standard resins.
Standard resins are the most commonly used resins for creating prototypes that are quickly printed on resin 3D printers. They are very generic resins, since they are usually used by various users to start in the world of 3D resin printing.
The use of this type of resins is intended for the manufacture of:
-Miniatures.
-Prototypes.
-Decorative elements.
-Household appliances.
It is one of the types of resin where you will find more varieties in brands, types of SLA and DLP technology as well as a greater variety in colors.
It has a great level of detail; it is smooth to the touch and in terms of post-processing it is easy to paint and sand. Although you have to be careful as it has a certain fragility to break and crack.
Standard 3D printing resin. Standard type resins for 3D printing leave us with a smooth finish and a hardness in our parts. They are the cheapest resins that exist and the easiest to find on the market. We have to bear in mind that this type of standard resin is the one with the most brands available, but we always have to verify that they are suitable for SLA, DLP or LCD. Transparent 3D printing resin. The transparent type resin for 3D printing has similar characteristics to the standard type resin. This has as its main difference, that it allows to print the objects transparently. The transparent type resin, are water resistant resins and allow the printing of parts with greater precision. This resin is also widely used to create a crystal effect in our pieces. It is also used so that it can be painted more easily, since, by not having uniform color throughout the piece, it makes the colors adapt better to the object. This resin is undoubtedly ideal for smaller models that need a smooth, high-quality surface.
Castable 3D printing resin (Castable Resin) . These resins are designed in cases where casting of the part is required. When this resin burns, since they are designed to do so, they define themselves in gas. When this resin burns, the process is clean, leaving no ash or residue. This resin reaches a high level of detail in the models and a good surface finish. In addition to the fact that the curing of the piece is faster than other resins. Hard 3D printing resin. Dura-type 3D printing resin offers strength and flexibility with characteristics similar to ABS filament material. This resin is usually used for objects that require greater efforts or stress. This resin also supports high impact resistance, so if our piece falls, it is unlikely that it will end up breaking. High temperature 3D printing resin. High temperature resins are resins that deform at a much higher temperature than standard resins. This is due to their high deflection temperature. When we use these resins, we must use supports and the required power will be greater than for other types of resins. This resin is used for the creation of functional prototypes, parts that require greater detail, precision and high thermal stability. This resin is resistant up to 238º, when it exceeds this number, it is when the piece begins to deform. Resins for dentistry: They do not have toxic components and are very resistant. They have made a strong entry into the dental industry as they are also very adaptable and quick to make. Flexible 3D Printing Resin Most flexible resins present a soft and pleasant touch in the pieces with properties similar to rubber, having finishes very similar to the soles of shoes or tires. Most flexible resins have a hardness of around 80A, but we can classify the elasticity or flexibility of our parts according to the Shore scale. For this reason, it is advisable to print with flexible when we want to reduce costs, make prototypes and obtain high-quality final parts such as shock absorbers, flexible or ergonomic parts more quickly. Flexible printing resins do not allow the creation of parts with rubber-like properties similar to, for example, phone protectors. This material allows us to bend and twist any object we create without worrying about its shape, since it then returns to its original shape. The disadvantage of flexible resin is that it is not recommended if we want to achieve high-precision objects. We have to take into account that the flexible resin is not elastic, but it has a low elongation, thus allowing the flexibility of the piece once printed and cured.
Dental Resins The Guide on types of 3D resins to print Dental Resins in dentistry and orthodontics is relatively new, but it is constantly growing and developing. Thanks to this technology, new patterns and technologies have been developed for 3D dental applications, allowing the creation, among other things: -Retainers. -Final models. -Surgical Guides. -Dentures. -Crowns. -Soft tissues for permanent or temporary implant models. -The use of this technology and these materials implies greater productivity, shorter times and lower manufacturing costs. High temperature resistant resins. Within the industrial resins, there are also resistant resins, designed to create parts with high wear resistance, capable of withstanding high temperatures, that is, mechanical parts with which we can create objects that do not crack with stress. Therefore, it can be used for applications such as the production of injection molding tools, the testing of channels designed for hot air or fluids, and the creation of tools for thermoforming and casting. Castable Resins Castable resins are often used by industrial manufacturers for the dental and jewelry industries, due to their ability to make parts that can be cast as metal.
These resins are capable of burning without ash or residue, resulting in sharp details and smooth surfaces. They are very simple resins to use directly from a 3D design to a real jewelry model. The key to these castable resins is that they have a high degree of burn-in, so that when the object is cast from a 3D printed part, all of the polymer is burned away, leaving only the perfectly formed design with the metal that we have cast. . If not, any plastic residue will lead to blemishes and warping in the casting. water washable resins. These resins do not need to be washed with isopropyl alcohol, but with water. Therefore, it greatly facilitates the post-processing of the parts. These resins are characterized by having a lower viscosity, low odour, a dry and less sticky finish. These resins tend to cure a bit faster, so may produce a bit less resolution, but adjusting exposure times can help. How to print different types of 3D resins? When printing resins, whatever the type, you must take into account a series of steps and key points, such as: -Where to place the 3D printer for the best results. -How to store the resin. -Printing speed. -How to properly peel off prints. The plastic filament of the FDM printer is not the same as the resin of the DLP LCD printers, also known as MSLA -Mask Stereolithography-. If the filament required certain care, the 3D printing resin also needs pampering and knowing how to handle it. To begin with, it's like the Gremlins, if you don't use it, never leave it exposed to light. This is a drawer, since it is a photosensitive resin, that is, it reacts to ultraviolet rays -between 395 and 415 Nm, if it is conventional-, hardening.
Basic tips for your resin: -Store it in an opaque and closed container, safe from light. -It is better that you do not keep it in storage for more than a year. -Do not mix different resins (except those that allow it). -Do not leave it in the printer tray for more than three days. -If you have left resin in the bucket, stir it well before printing. -Before adding resin to the bucket, shake the bottle well, vigorously. -They recommend not mixing leftover resin from a print with the new one. -When you save the leftover resin in its container, filter it with a fine strainer. -Do not mix resin and alcohol as it dissolves and corrupts it. -There are resins that are cleaned with water; dries the piece well before curing it in the UV oven. .Murphy's Law says that there can be defective resins; if you have too many failed prints, try another one. -The hardest resins are the ones that offer the most detail, but they are also the most brittle. -Tricks for your resin. -Keep her warm; a resin below 25º can cause problems. -In winter if the room is less than 20º, do not print. -You can keep the resin warm with a USB bottle warmer. -To better remove the resin, you can use an electric magnetic stirrer. -Adding pigment to the resin varies the exposure time; pay attention to this. -To find the best exposure time there are ""print tables"" on the Internet. -You can vary the properties of a resin by adding small amounts of others, but this must be indicated by the manufacturer. Hopefully these tips make your life easier as you transition into the world of resin printers.
Apart from the clear uses of each type of resin (dental, castable, flexible, high temperature resistance and etc.), some specific resin for one application is also valid for other applications. In this case, there are dental resins (Dental Model Formlabs, zDental Model Sand, Dental Resin HARZ Labs), which show high mechanical properties and a high-quality surface finish, ideal for printing final functional parts. Why buy a resin 3D printer? The appearance of 3D resin printers has meant a very significant technological and utilitarian advance. Also, the manufacturers of these machines have been able to reduce prices. In this way, they are beginning to conquer the market, both for domestic and professional use. The decision to buy a 3D printer that works by stereolithography requires that you know how to use it well. The resin that makes it work is a more complex material than the plastic used in other types of printers. In addition to the fact that the resulting piece needs a post-processing process. However, the great advantage of this technology is its precision, quality and detail. In fact, objects printed with an SLA are being used in industries such as engineering, jewelry, and dentistry. Even, also to make prosthetics. A standard pot of resin usually contains between 500 and 1000ml. Actually, the duration of it will depend, to a large extent, on the number of pieces you make. Also of the complexity of the same. The material that you have left over from a print can be saved for the next piece. Therefore, you will not waste anything. In addition, the resin is a chemical product, so it does not have an expiration date and it does not spoil. This means that as long as you store it properly, without exposing it to daylight, you can continue to use it until it's gone. Function First of all, you should ask yourself what use you are going to give your printer. Will you use it at home or do you need it to do professional projects? The answer to this question will depend on the type of 3D gadget you will buy. For home use. You need a machine that prints in good condition, but whose cost is low. You seek to make objects and figures for your personal use and enjoyment. To do this, all you have to do is find an LCD. The manufacturing materials are simpler and will give you a very acceptable quality. For professional use. What you are looking for is an effective, precise and detailed science. One with which they can create objects for specialized use. We recommend SLAs or DLPs. You will get soft and smooth finishes, with great thoroughness. Despite their higher price,
these machines are the best in stereolithography technology on the market. For educational use. Resin 3D printers are totally discouraged for a pedagogical function. These are devices that require a certain skill to be manipulated. In addition, they have potentially toxic and dangerous components. In this case, it is best to use other types of printing technologies, such as the FDM or filament printer.
Space
The volume that a resin 3D printer occupies is quite substantial. Also, you need good ventilation. It is that you will be working with irritating materials. That is why you must make sure that you have the necessary space to install your machine.
Similarly, carrying out an SLA print requires many materials, both for the process and the final cleaning. Make sure that the place where you install it has enough space for all of them. Finally, the work must be carried out at temperatures between 20 °C and 30 °C. Therefore, you will need a warm location.
Accessories
Making a figure by 3D printing with resin is not a quick or easy task. In part, it is due to the number of external materials and accessories that you must prepare. When the work process is finished, cleaning is carried out to remove excess resin. To do this, you will need a container with solvent or a similar product recommended by the manufacturer.
Also, after cleaning, comes the post-curing process. The final piece needs this treatment. The easiest way to do this is to leave the object in the sun. Or under a UV lamp. The latter is ideal, since you will be able to control the process and the light exposure. There are professional post-processing devices, although they are less affordable.
These are all types of 3D printing resin, which are currently used for printing parts. Remember that not all 3D printers allow all types of resins, there are even 3D printers that only accept filament material. Now that you know what 3D resin is and how you should choose the right resin for the 3D printer you have at home.

3D printing is a very attractive world because, compared to traditional two-dimensional printing, it allows us to create the objects we imagine (although we will discover later that there are limitations). On an industrial level the applications are multiple, but on a domestic scale it has meant a revolution in the maker culture on a par with free projects.
Ease of assembly and use, proper documentation, and good overall print quality are all things we take into account when choosing an ideal 3D printer for beginners. You should be able to make good impressions and it shouldn't be difficult to get familiar with the process.
In the domestic market we find two types of 3D printers: those that we buy ready to use and those that come in a kit that we will have to assemble ourselves.
The advantage of the commercial ones is that you don't need to have much technical knowledge to start them: just take them out of the box, plug them in and we can start printing. Being closed and commercialized models, we can always resort to the manufacturer's support in case of problems. Of course, for the same specifications, they are usually more expensive than DIY ones.
Plus, setting up your printer offers some assurance that you at least know how it works, which is essential for such a necessary task as calibrating it to print properly. Mishaps in 3D printing are the order of the day and sooner or later they will happen, so it doesn't hurt to be able to remove and replace parts. Precisely another of the advantages of DIY is the ease of finding compatible parts and assembling them. Or to expand your printer.
Before purchasing a 3D printer, you have to know what specific use it will be given. It seems a useless approach, however, it is vital to be clear that it really is what is needed and thus choose the one that best suits, not only our needs, but also our pocket. The following aspects must be considered:
Printing frequency
If a high demand and a lot of use is expected, then a powerful and highly durable equipment is required. Its cost may be higher, but in the long run it will be a better investment than equipment that breaks down shortly after purchasing it.
Print volume
Most home 3D printers do not print objects larger than 10 – 12 cubic inches. The size of the print is related to its price, so it is an aspect to take into account. There are some cheap ones on the market that print smaller objects between 5 and 7 inches. The larger the size, the higher the cost.
Compatible Materials
According to what we have planned, we must consider what type of material is compatible with the printer. Much of it uses a material called PLA and other polymers. However, if you plan to make objects that are more resistant to high temperatures, you should check that the printer is compatible with the special materials that are on the market, such as TPU or ABS. The material most used by a 3D printer is thermoplastic. It is the most common for domestic use because it is the cheapest. Although, there are other types of materials, to be able to modify them at will. It all depends on the needs of each one. Likewise, there is the possibility of caring for the environment with PLA filament. Since it is a biodegradable material derived from products such as sugar cane, cornstarch or potato starch. It is the most ecologically viable solution, if we refer to materials to design 3D objects.
Quality in finishes
There are teams that offer a very good level in this regard. It is necessary to consider that to print an object in 3D, layers are superimposed on layers, these are printed one by one. The thinner these layers, the better the quality of the object. For optimal quality, it is suggested to look for equipment that offers at least 0.1mm to 0.05mm thickness. If you want to print complex objects, it is important that the equipment has two or more print heads.
A large part of the economic and domestic models only have one, the most professional ones have totally independent heads. As in the case of print size, the higher the quality and the higher the specifications, the higher the cost.
Beware of printer noise
Something you should never forget is that printers make noise when printing and, depending on the model, it can be quite annoying, since in some cases that noise can exceed 60 or 65dBs. Keep in mind that for a relatively small print, it might take 3-4 hours to complete very easily, so the noise it makes and the location of the 3D printer is very important.
If you are going to have it in your living room or in an office, keep in mind that it can make an annoying noise or even make a noise above a normal conversation.
Filament cost
Some printers use generic spare parts that are quite accessible and of considerable durability. However, others require original spare parts, that is, only the manufacturer sells them and obviously this increases the value and the difficulty in finding them.
Investigate the software that the machine will carry
Although the design program is on our own. The printer software will basically prepare the part for printing, and through various functions it will allow everything from selecting the part position to the printing speed. Before purchasing a certain 3D printer model, it is advisable not only to find out about the printing software that the equipment has, but also to ask for a demonstration, so we can test and visualize the process and it will allow us to have a clearer and more realistic opinion.
Take a good look at the size, weight and shape of the 3D printer
Surely when looking at printers you will have seen the variety that exists in sizes and shapes. It may seem silly to look at something like that, but the truth is that it is not so silly.
There are currently many models of 3D printers and each one has a size and shape that you will have to adapt to and that you will have to fit into a hole in your home or office, warehouse... Keep in mind that there are printers that they are tall, others that are wider, some squarer and others more asymmetrical; so, the final shape and size of the printer will affect the space you need to place it.
In addition, the size of the printer is closely linked to the volume of printing and the larger it is, the larger its size can be. That is why pay special attention when you see the specifications of the model since the printing volume is not the same as the final size of the 3D printer and generally the size it occupies will be larger than the printing volume.
If size is important, weight will also influence your choice. The weight will depend on the materials in which the 3D printer is made and they will be specified in the card of the same, so do not forget to look at it well and think that, at a larger size, it is very possible that the weight will be greater, so that you should not forget to take it into account either for placement or transport.
Where to put a 3D printer?
If you are thinking of placing a 3D printer at home, you have to assess several aspects. The main one is the noise they make. Although some are relatively quiet, it is not recommended to place it in a bedroom. In addition, avoid areas of the home that have humidity to avoid unwanted breakdowns.
Make sure you have free space around you so you can work comfortably. As you will have to load the filament, to place it, you will need space above the printer. Also, to calibrate it and perform maintenance you will need space around it. Make sure it is not in a closed place so that it heats up as little as possible.
Below, we mention some of the printers that we consider to be good options if you want to integrate into the world of 3d printing.

The monochrome LCD screen is also thermally stable and has a much longer lifespan than conventional LCD screens. You can print with it for more than 2000 hours!
Furthermore, thanks to the larger LCD screen, the Photon Mono SE also has a slightly larger installation space of 130 x 78 x 160mm.
Anycubic App Remote Control
Photon Mono SE has a Wifi module, so it has much more convenient connectivity than conventional 3D printers. You can also connect your Photon Mono SE using the Anycubic app, where you can monitor your printing process or adjust print settings.
High stability
Anycubic Photon Mono SE has a metal casing and stable dual linear rails to significantly improve printing stability and success rate. In addition to a built-in cooling system for the UV exposure unit to increase print performance and shelf life, it's definitely a great choice.
Anycubic Mono X Resin Printer
The Mono X is a resin 3D printer with LCD technology. It has an 8.9-inch 4k Monochrome LCD screen. Thus, the 3D printer achieves incredible speeds of 1-2 seconds per layer. The Anycubic Mono X's new screen increases lifespan compared to traditional LCD screens, allowing you to print even more hours before you notice even the slightest wear.
Its large volume of printing does not imply lower quality. Rather the complete opposite! The Mono X offers quality down to 50 microns, the machine also has anti-aliasing, for incredibly detailed parts.
Printer Volume
Build Volume: A large build area for your 3D prints: 192mm (Length) * 120mm (Width) * 245mm (Height)

assembly
If you have experience with Anycubic machines, you will know that they provide clear and detailed instructions and even plastic gloves so your fingers don't get dirty during the assembly process.
To get started, you'll need to mount the spindles and control box to the frame, then put the two color-coded multicore cables in place, knowing it'll be ready to print in 30 minutes max.
Bed leveling
Good news: Anycubic Chiron 3D printer has a self-leveling function. The machine performs the leveling process by checking 25 points on the print bed. As far as we know, no other 3D printer performs a calibration checking so many points. Some 3D printers, like the Lulzbot TAZ 6, check all four corners of the bed, and many others, like the Prusa i3 MK3, don't go above 9 points. Checking 25 points on the print bed won't automatically result in a perfectly flatbed (it will probably take longer to calibrate), but we'll look into this in depth as soon as we get our hands on one of these printers.
Titan Extruder
According to the specifications, the Anycubic Chiron comes with a Titan extruder. The info sheets don't detail if it's Anycubic branded or if it's the original open source E3D Titan extruder (less likely).

This blog post will start by discussing the differences between the typical desktop printer and an industrial grade printer. Broadly speaking if it is the same printing technology a desktop printer and an industrial printer will be similar, but their capabilities differ and that is the key to being able to identify if an industrial printer is right for my 3D printing needs.
Accuracy
Generally, geometric tolerances and part accuracy are dependent on the calibration of the 3D printer and the complexity of the model to be printed. Typically industrial cutting 3D printers produce parts with higher accuracy than desktop printers, this is due to the more detailed control of the processing parameters during printing. Industrial 3D printers run calibration algorithms before each print they make.
Production Capabilities and Costs
A key difference between a desktop 3D printer and an industrial 3D printer is the associated cost. The rise in popularity of desktop 3D printers has dramatically reduced the cost of acquiring and using a printer as well as increasing the availability of consumables.
The production capabilities of an industrial slicing 3D printer are typically greater than its desktop counterpart, meaning that an industrial 3D printer can complete a large order much faster than a desktop 3D printer. Industrial 3D printers have a much larger printing surface, which means they can produce parts of considerable dimensions in a single print or print more smaller parts at the same time.
Industrial cutting 3D printers are specifically designed for repeatability and reliability. They can usually produce the same part over and over again. Desktop 3D printers require a higher level of user maintenance and regular calibration.
One of the main benefits of additive manufacturing is the ability to print – in a single action – huge objects that are traditionally made up of multiple small parts. Joints, seams and assembly points can be weak areas in any finished product and require designers and engineers to make adjustments to their designs. Large-scale printing frees designers from these limitations. From furniture to molds to sculpture, 3D printing enables complex geometries and unique functionalities that give designers and engineers a blank sheet of paper for innovation.
There are large industrial printers that can take up an entire room and cost hundreds of thousands, and robotic 3D printers capable of printing houses and boats, but we're going to see a growing niche in large-scale printers - those that can print something the size of a chair (1000 mm or just over 3 feet) with great detail, speed and quality.
We have taken the task of collecting a selection of printers that are part of this segment for the consideration of our readers, below is a table with a summary of the printers to see.

Voxeljet
With a build volume of 4,000 x 2,000 x 1,000 mm, voxeljet describes the VX4000 as the ""world's largest industrial 3D printer for printing individual molds and sand cores."" In addition, the printer can produce small components in series and has a resolution of up to 200 dpi.
The VX4000 uses Binder Jetting technology, which works by depositing droplets of a bonding agent to fuse powder material. In contrast to many other systems, the VX4000's build platform is not lowered after each layer is completed; instead, the printhead and coater are elevated. This allows the printer to support considerable weights on its build platform. The system also promises virtual continuous production thanks to interchangeable build platform elements. Suitable for cast metal molds, the printing platform has proven to be a boon to the foundry industry as well as companies that use casting or molds in any way.
On interchangeable construction elements, the VX4000 was designed with construction platforms that are alternately inserted into the process station allowing for continuous 24/7 operation.
Remarkably, the VX4000 printer can print a 4 meter by 2 meter layer in just two passes, as a result the system not only ensures fast manufacturing of large objects but also enables efficient production of small batches of parts.
By using standard casting materials, 3D printed shapes can be seamlessly integrated into existing value chains. The VX400 uses Furan resin optimized for 3D printing and standard silica sand.
To recap, among its highlights:
Continuous operation with multiple construction platforms (arranged alternately)
Variable use of construction volume for individual applications
Effective and continuous operation due to robust design and high quality components
Fast and cost-effective manufacturing of large components and batches
Fully automated production based on CAD files
One thing to keep in mind, however, is that the VX400 comes with a price tag to consider, at around $1,500,000. But if making an investment of this nature is impossible for you, voxeljet's 3D printing services give you the opportunity to take advantage of this printing platform.

The price of 3D printers in Mexico tends to go from 3500 pesos onward. Taking note that this is the starting price, finding printers for up to 10 million pesos. These printers are focused on other markets of industrial leanings. To give your first steps on 3D printing this brought to us some important points to account, even before even starting to acquire a printer.
There exist many entry barriers which are going to be viewed next. At this point we all think that with acquiring a 3D printer we’re going to start printing and I think we all be a bit misinformed about this point.
Buying the cheapest 3D printer in the market, is nothing more than long and strenuous hours, days, weeks, and even months for some to make it work, and this is because quality is directly proportional to the printer price. What you’re not paying in price, you’ll have to pay it in time. Gather data or information, a bunch of repairings and part substitutions.
However, there are relatively cheaper printers that do excellent printings. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend an Ender 3, Mega i3s, Anet et4, in that order. Due to their being pre-assembled in about 30 minutes you’ll have it assembled. A Prusa Mini is also an excellent equipment to consider, much easier to assemble than its bigger sister MK3S.
On the other hand there are the printers with an elevated price, depending on what is elevated to you, everyone has distinct purchasing power. There are printers such as BCN SIGMA D25, Ultimaker S5, which are focused on the entry level to the industrial sector. This sector is focused on getting to print sooner as possible. Being expensive doesn’t mean it’s going to print better than a cheaper one, but that the difference lies in being focused more to being plug and play, there’s no 3D printer exempt for maintenance. You always want your 3D printer working at 100%, don’t forget that preventive maintenance it’s better than corrective and cheaper. Don’t try to save money, these printers are made to work in their own ecosystem, that means, if you start to use other types of materials, brands, accessories, your printer can start to give you problems, because these ecosystems are made to work in harmony with all their components. You can use non official accessories, other materials, but you will get configuration problems, tests and errors until you find the correct parameters. It can even happen that if you return to the original materials, these don’t give all their performance due to modified parameters. If your intention is learning, then any entry-level range printer can be a good choice to start. These entry-level industrial printers are truly starting options and are recommended to companies that don’t want to experiment but work quickly with 3D printing.
3D printing is magic, more so the first time. But in this magic exist many variables, disciplines and technologies that give life to tridimensional objects. Because of this 3D printing associated with a 3D printing price tends to be complex as of today, of course over the years it has been found the way to improve and make this technological discipline cheaper. Which is giving enormous steps month to month. However, let's be cautious and take with a pinch of salt the merchandising about it.
3D printing is complicated to someone that doesn’t come from engineering, someone that absorbs knowledge easily will find it simple. Everything is relative to the point of view taken. As any discipline it takes time and effort to learn. But it is gratifying and fun. Careers related to engineering will be the first to dominate these fields, that’s because this technology is a mix of various, and includes mechanical, polymers, electronics, etc.
We’re looking at the first part of this process (hardware), we barely start to scratch the surface, you don’t notice all that’s not seen on 3D printing. Just as the hardware is a fundamental part, so is the software. Nowadays, there exists a variety of slicers, as they’re known as 3D printing software, since they slice the 3D part in layers with the finality to build your part in that way.
The more popular options are:
CURA from Ultimake and community: Free and powerful. Possibly the most used by estimates. It’s a software design by the company Ultimaker for its printers, but it has supported the community, so you can add any 3D printer you desire. This software was becoming private some years earlier but the community rose against it, due to the fact that the community has created a lot of technology with no profits. Maybe Ultimaker will try it again later, but meanwhile it’s still free.
Simplify 3D: It can be yours for 149 dollars. It's powerful and stable. I recommend you to acquire it if you’re going to make a business out of 3D printing. This software can work with complex 3D parts without a hitch. It makes heavy files or with lots of polygons wonderfully.
Prusa Slicer: Free and based on Repetier. It has evolved with their printers, however, it needs polishing on some aspects, it’s still powerful but the problem is that it’s not user friendly.
One of the main questions is what is the best 3d printing software. It always depends on what you’re looking for. Some slicers work better with certain figures, others optimize the trips that a 3D printer must do, getting better part finish, having lower printing times, etc.
Taking the price range that these 3D printers tend to have, also taking in account the characteristics that the user could ask, these can be divided in tiers depending on its quality and price.
The market of 3D printers grows yearly with a variety of models, something logical if we think in the huge potential it possesses and its growing quality with more competitive prices. Because of this it can be hard to choose or decide for a specific model, looking at the variety available with different technical characteristics between them, also it’s fundamental with what criteria is utilized to choose a printer, because not taking in account such things can make for a bad experience or a loss of capital.
Just a decade ago, a standard 3D printer was an industrial tool that cost thousands of euros. Nowadays, the typical printer can be on your desk and we would dare to say that it costs less than the device you use to read this article. Today it’s easier than ever to find an excellent cheap 3D printer that adjusts to any budget. For only 200 € you can get an excellent machine that allows you to start in the world of 3D printing in just a matter of minutes.
Despite the great variety of quality printers available for less than 1000 €, we have opted for the Creality Ender 3 V2 as our best choice: a printer that, for a relatively low price, offers great performance, numerous functions and a huge community that probably will continue to grow. Basically, it’s an Ender 3 Pro improved for almost the same price.
If you have more money to spend and you don’t mind giving up a little work space, it’s hard to find arguments against the Original Prusa Mini+. With a price superior to 400 €, the Mini+ offers to the user an excellent printing experience backed up by the great customer support from the company and its flourishing community. Its user interface, the printing bed, the wire mesh bed leveling and its ease of use in general make it a pleasure to work with, this makes it the choice for enterprise users.
The Original Prusa i3 MK3S+ starts from the great benchmark for desktop 3D printers that is the MK3S (the company has recently updated the model MK3S+, with small changes in the design). However, its price of almost 800 € makes it almost inaccessible to many being from a high range. In any case, if you can allow it yourself, don’t doubt it. There is no other equal printer in the market.
We will now analyze some of the low cost printers with good performance that go from 200 € to 500 € respectively.
Voxelab Aquila is a cheap 3D printer that has impressed us enough to relegate the Anycubic Mega Zero and Creality Ender 3 in this list.
First, it’s an affordable 3D printer, with a price lower than 200 €. Depending on the moment it can be purchased for approximately 190 €. It’s accessible to work with it, thanks to a brilliant user interface and ease of use, with simple menus. The same can be said about the slicing program VoxelMaker. It’s a redesigned version of Flashprint and it’s adequate for beginners. Nevertheless, there also exists the option to use other slicer software.
This printer gives us excellent printing quality with little effort, thanks to its carborundum crystal tray, that works perfectly with ABS and PLA filaments. You might want to have a glue stick handy when working with PETG. The cooling process is particularly good on the Aquila, so you might not need great efforts to get the desired results. In short, it’s easy to recommend this printer, whose amazing performance surprises on an affordable machine.
Biqu may have created a cheap printer capable of unseating the Ender 3 V2 from Creality. It shouldn’t surprise us that the B1 it’s basically a clone of the Ender 3, but with some delightful improvements that make it more attractive.
This also shouldn’t surprise us, due to the fact that the company behind Biqu is BigTreTech, a brand whose reputation is based on the development of modifying Creality printers during the last years. Knowing that, it’s no wonder that the company developed the B1 as a new start, a blank page, for the experienced users.
The B1 adds a SKR 1.4 motherboard of 32 bits, completed with <<plug-and-play>> connection ports for future updates, such as automatic bed leveling probes and other similar elements. It also has a terminal function, that allows you to introduce G code directly in the printer, allowing you to make changes in the machine in its own languages, if you wish to do so.
B1 also has an excellent touch user interface, but it also offers you the option to change between a modern and elegant system and the Marlin system, which is older and controlled by the use of a dial.
With a greater printing volume than the Ender 3 V2, a superior kit and very tempting price of approximately 195 €, the B1 is a great alternative to the Creality Ender 3 V2, although perhaps it would be more adequate to experienced users in 3D printing.
Creality Ender 3 V2 it’s not a revision from an older model, but rather an improvement. Taking the simple design from the Ender 3 original, and sophisticating it with useful additions that make it more reliable and comfortable to use, the Ender 3 V2 keeps the balance between high quality printing and a competitive price, in its case of about 220 €.
The building volume keeps being the same as the Ender 3, that is, 220 x 220 x 250 mm. Also, it keeps the Bowden style extruder and its capacity to print with the common filaments, such as PLA, PETG, and if handled carefully TPU. A novelty with the Ender 3 V2 is the addition of belt tensioners, updated electronics that include a 32 bit board and stepper motor controllers with printing silencer, an integrated tool storage drawer, a touch user interface, and a number of improvements.
If we have to compare the Ender 3 V2 with any older model, perhaps the more just will be to do it with the Ender 3 Pro, the one with more in common, and, for a price of barely 50 € above, it’s worthy to make the leap.
Despite its name, the CR-6 SE from Creality is, in essence, an Ender 3. The characteristics from the CR-6 SE are a display of power. Among them, is notable the exclusive automatic leveling system of the printing bed with a tension meter (that works really well), the real time displacement on the Z axis during the printing process, the personalized aluminum extruders, the dual Z axis motors, a touch screen that responds very well, a personalized extrusion assembly and an almost skeletal hotend.
Print quality also borders on excellence. This and the range of features of the machine, combined with a construction volume and price similar to the Ender 5 Pro, make the CR-6 SE unseat the Ender from this list. Its price it’s around 320 €.
i3 Mega from Anycubic is a reliable printer, easy to use and that offers excellent impressions. In the case of the Mega X, Anycubic kept the characteristics that worked well (basically, all of them) and tripled the size of the machine.
As a result, the Mega X it’s a type of tank (not in vain it has to accommodate a construction volume of 300 x 300 x 305 mm), it’s benefited from small changes to improve the general experience, including stepper motors on the Z axis and duel leveling rods on the Y axis. The printed parts adhere correctly to the huge Ultrabase printing bed and a Titan type extruder helps to the good functioning of the extruding system.
What is certain is that, being a novel incorporation to the Mega line of Anycubic, we hoped for more radical changes, such as WiFi connection or automatic leveling of the printing bed. In turn, it’s a XXL version of the i3 Mega, although it’s not bad either, it doesn’t stop being a huge reliable printer. Its price in the market is 360 €.
It might not be perfect, but the Prusa Mini+ is up there with some of the best 3D printers. With a fantastic printing quality, an effortless functioning and class-leading features, the Mini+ is the type of printer we’ll take everywhere.
Among its more useful and interesting characteristics are that it comes with an extractable magnetic printing bed with PEI coating and a developed firmware with a series of hallucinating hardware based functionalities, such as wire mesh bed leveling. It can be said that the best of the Original Prusa is the uninterrupted customer support by the brand. Periodically, it launches firmware updates that correct errors, introduce improvements and even add new functions. Nonetheless, it’s still pending to incorporate WiFi connection.
When we’ve problems with the printer Bowden tube (which seems to be a common problem with the Mini series), we contacted the technical customer support anonymously and they solved our problem quickly with new tubes.
Another disadvantage is that the Mini+ is, undoubtedly, with a maximum work volume of 180 x 180 x 180 mm. For the 415 € tag, we understand that it’s users want a little more slack. In any case, unless this is an absolutely vital aspect of your business, the Mini+ keeps being a good recommendation.
The Artillery Sidewinder X1 is a 3D printer with a huge construction volume, that not only impress with its power and reliability with PLA filament, but also with its inclusion of features well thought out in relation to their potential for large-scale printing, mainly, a Volcano styled hotend.
The X1 has a construction volume of 300 x 300 x 400 mm, with a direct action extruder positioned above its Volcano hotend. This hotend melts and lets a great quantity of filament at all times, which will allow you to increase the printing speed or the layer height (as long as you have the appropriate head) without any risk of extrusion problems. However, the great crystal covered bed moves on the Y axis, so its max speed it’s limited by all the mass in movement.
This huge crystal printing bed is coated with a Ultrabase-like texture, it holds the printed parts when they’re hot and frees them when they cool down. The ordered belt wiring gives the X1 a neat appearance, though between the user base there are few advocates for this type of cables, due to the extended tension that are exposed due to printer movement. During tests, we observed wobbling along the Z axis on the superior part of the construction space, but if you remove the spool holder above the structure, the wobbling should wind down. Its current market price is 435 €.
The Monoprice Voxel is a recreation of the Adventurer 3 3D printer from Flashforge, but the differences and improvements are not merely aesthetical, and the experience in terms of software and printing that it offers contribute to an easy use of the machine, with a soft learning curve. With its extractable bed, its printing control chamber and its WiFi connectivity, it differentiates the Voxel from the majority of models in this list, though the small construction volume and the rigidity of the slicer that it uses can make it seem inflexible to more ambitious users. In any case, if you wish a quick setup and effortless maintenance and management, this is an excellent choice. Its current price on the market is 465 €."

https://www.maerospacertc.com/post/the-best-ways-to-3d-print-metal,"The best ways to 3D print metal
All that has changed now that metal 3D printing is available on desktop FDM printers and a wider range of professional machines that produce better quality parts at a more affordable price.
There are about 10 ways to 3D print metal parts. These fall into tech categories loosely based on whether you're printing with metallic filament, metallic powder, or metallic wire. There are even metal-infused resins, metal rods, and metal pellets as material options, all of which produce parts with different attributes. Selecting which metal technology to use is a balance of needs. Consider the importance of details and shape, size, strength, metal type, cost, print speed, and volume.
In 3D printing, it is necessary to choose your priorities as all current technologies have pros and cons when it comes to these considerations, and unfortunately, no 3D method prints super strong parts quickly, cheaply, and perfectly.
Parts like this mouthpiece that are 3D printed with metal filament require post-processing usually at a third-party vendor (Source: BCN3D)
This small steel nozzle above is an example of a metal filament printed replacement part. A part like this is perfectly suited for metallic filament because it could be quickly 3D printed on-site (in a shop or office) using an affordable FDM printer and then shipped to a third party for post-processing. In total, the process could take only a few days. Other manufacturing methods for a single replacement part would have been too costly and time-consuming.
Sample of orthopedic implants 3D printed in titanium by Zenith Tecnica using GE's electron beam fusion technology (Source: Zenith Tecnica)
These sample hip and knee implants (above) were printed using electron beam melting (EBM). Parts, like these, are intricately detailed, made from expensive titanium, and built with extremely high material quality and tolerance to meet government standards for medical implants. The vacuum environment of EBM 3D printers ensures clean and controlled build conditions, and the high-power electron beam allows the printer to produce multiple parts per build for high productivity.
3D printed crane hooks using WAAM 3D printing (Source: Huisman)
This huge earlier crane hook was printed using Wire Arch Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) and then machined. An extremely large and heavy part like this is ideal for WAAM because the technology is faster than any traditional method of metal fabrication, such as forging or casting, and just as strong. Additionally, this part can be produced at a facility closer to the point of need or even on-site, for example, on an oil rig.
Cobra Golf introduced the 3D-printed King Supersport-35 putter in 2020. It is 3D printed using HP Multi Jet metal binder jetting (Source: Cobra Golf)
These golf clubs from Cobra Golf were 3D printed using a metal binder jet from HP. The unique shape could not be made with any other manufacturing technology. Because thousands of identical parts were required, the manufacturer chose binder injection for its speed and performance. The technology also produces an excellent surface finish. Cobra Golf was also able to reorient club manufacturing to a US-based additive manufacturer, saving on environmental and actual shipping costs from its manufacturing center in Asia.
FDM and extrusion
Metal parts 3D printed with stainless steel filament from forwarding AM on an FDM printer (Source: Ultimaker, IGo3D)
There are some technologies for 3D printing that are included in extrusion. One is the familiar fused deposition model (FDM) which uses a filament made from a plastic base with metal particles uniformly infused within it. Metallic filaments for metal parts must contain a high percentage of metal powder (around 80%) and go through post-processing steps to remove the plastic component and condense the metal part. Several desktop FDM printers on the market can print with current metal filaments available in stainless steel (316L, 17-4 PH), copper, and titanium.
Another technology uses what is essentially a filament with a much higher concentration of metallic energy. So much so that it's practically a solid bar of metal, but it can still be heated and extruded. These materials are often exclusive to a particular 3D printer, such as Markforged or Desktop Metal, and are more expensive than regular FDM but less than other metal 3D printing methods.
The third method of metal extrusion to mention (although there are more in the industrial sector) is extrusion using metal pellets, which can be the same material used in injection molding and therefore less expensive, or pellets manufactured especially.
Laser Metal Powder Bed Fusion: Selective Laser Fusion (SLM)
Powder bed fusion machines like these from printer manufacturer SLM use lasers to fuse metal powder and come in a variety of sizes (Source: SLM)
3D printers that use high-power lasers to selectively melt a metal powder make up the majority of metal 3D printers. The technology is often referred to as selective laser fusing or powder bed fusing along with printer-specific terms. The melts are fused layer by layer on a molecular basis until the homogeneous pattern is complete. Printer operators may use ""pure"" metallic materials, although alloys are also in regular use.
An LPBF 3D printer houses metallic raw material powder. The printer pushes the powder into the chamber where a coating sheet (like a windshield wiper) or roller spreads it in a thin layer onto the substrate or build plate. Next, a high-power laser fuses a two-dimensional cut of the part by selectively melting the powder material. The build plate is then lowered to the height of a small layer, and the coater spreads another layer of fresh powder over the surface. The printer repeats these steps until the part is finished.
SLM can have a better initial surface finish and higher accuracy than EBM.
metal binder blasting
Metal binder blasted metal parts from 3D printer maker ExOne, now part of Desktop Metal (Source: ExOne)
Metal binder jetting can print parts with complex pattern fills instead of being solid, the resulting parts being dramatically lighter while still being strong. The bond jet porosity feature can also be used to achieve lighter end parts for medical applications such as implants. As with other additive manufacturing processes, binder injection can produce complex components with internal structures and channels, eliminating the need for welding and reducing part count and component weight. Redesigning your metal parts for binder injection can lead to a drastic reduction in material used and wasted.
In general, the material properties of metal bond jet parts are equivalent to metal parts produced with metal injection molding, which is one of the most widely used manufacturing methods for mass production of metal parts. . In addition, the parts of the binder jet exhibit a smoother surface, especially in the internal channels.
Arc Wire Additive Manufacturing (WAAM)
MX3D WAAM Steel Parts (Source: MX3D)
Wire arc additive manufacturing uses metal wire as the material and an electric arc as the energy source, much like welding. The arc melts the wire as a robotic arm deposit it layers upon layer onto a surface, like a multi-axis turntable. As with welding, an inert gas is used to prevent oxidation and improve or control the properties of the metal.
The process gradually builds material into a complete 3D object or a repair of an existing object. There are no support structures to remove, and finished parts can be CNC machined to close tolerances if required or surface polished. Printed parts are typically heat-treated to relieve residual stresses.
Laser Directed Energy Deposition (DED)
3D printed metal parts using directed energy deposition technology involving lasers and metal powder on DMG Mori machines (Source: DMG Mori)
Directed energy laser deposition uses a laser to melt a metallic material that is simultaneously deposited through a nozzle. The metallic material may be in the form of powder or wire. Despite its ability to build complete parts with DED techniques, this technology is generally used to repair or add material to existing objects. When combined with CNC machining, it can produce a precise finished part.
DED systems may differ from PBF systems as the powders used are typically larger in size and require a higher energy density. This results in faster build rates compared to the PBF system. However, this leads to poorer surface quality which may require additional machining. Support structures commonly used in PBF systems are rarely if ever used in DED, which often uses multi-axis turntables to rotate the build platform to achieve the different features. Without the need for a powder bed, DED systems can repair or print existing parts.
Metal Lithography
Metal prints made with a metal-infused resin material are typically found in micro 3D printing (Source: Incus)
Metal lithography, also called Lithography-based Metal Manufacturing (LMM), uses as a mixture of photosensitive resins and metal power, called slurry, as feedstock. This light-sensitive slurry is selectively polymerized layer by layer with light. Metal lithography boasts excellent surface quality and is mostly, but not exclusively, used in micro 3D printing, so it has extremely high detail.
Cold Spray
Cold spraying is a manufacturing technology that sprays metal powders at supersonic speeds to bond them together without melting them, resulting in almost no thermal stress. Since the early 2000s it has been used as a coating process, but more recently several companies have adapted cold spraying for additive manufacturing because it can apply layers of metal in exact geometries down to several centimeters at speeds between 50 and 100 times larger than typical metal 3D printers. .
For additive manufacturing, cold spraying is used to rapidly fabricate metal replacement parts and for on-the-spot repairs and refurbishments of metal components, such as military equipment and machinery in the oil and gas industry, allowing companies to companies potentially save millions on remanufacturing and disruptions to workflows. . Repaired parts, in some cases, can be better than new.
Electron Beam Metal Powder Bed Fusion - Electron Beam Melting (EBM)
Electron beam melting is a 3D printing technology that uses an electron beam as the energy source and is primarily used with conductive metals. All EBM 3D printers consist of a power source capable of emitting the electron beam, a powder bin, a powder feeder, a powder coater, and a heated build platform. It is important to note that the printing process must take place in a vacuum. That's because the electrons in the electron beam would collide with the gas molecules, which would ""kill"" the electron beam.
EBM can be faster than SLM due to the higher power of electron beam energy and product parts with lower residual stress than SLM."

https://www.maerospacertc.com/post/what-to-consider-when-buying-a-3d-printer,"What to consider when buying a 3D printer?
If you are looking for a printer, it is important to know how 3D printers differ from each other, so that you can choose the one that best suits your needs. A wide variety of styles can be used by a particular audience or type of print.
Before buying a 3D printer, some specifications should be considered. If you already know the features you want in your printer, you don't need to know this information, but it will be helpful if you're a first-time 3D printer owner.
Getting an optimal printer will depend on how you plan to use it, that is, you must first have established the project for which you will use it. For example, for a school purpose, you would purchase a printer that is easy to set up and use, requires minimal maintenance, and has average print quality. In design and other professions, it would be best to get one that provides surface-quality prints. In companies involved in short-run manufacturing, a printer with a large build area will be necessary so that several objects can be printed at once. Now that you have the project set up, here's what to consider:
printer type You must first choose a printer where your printing process fits the plan you have in mind. There are different printing processes, among them, there are three most common types, which are suitable for users with different levels of experience. The first is Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), which is based on heating and extruding a polymeric filament, this process is the most economical and suitable for amateurs. The second process is stereolithography (SLA), where ultraviolet light is used to photo-polymerize a photosensitive liquid. The third type is powder layer melting (SLS), in which powder is melted into a flatbed using lasers.
supported materials Each type of printer handles different materials, it is important to choose a machine that can print the material you want to use in your projects. The most common materials in 3D printing are PLA (polylactic acid) and ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene), they are thermoplastics and are known for their low cost, ease of use, and versatility. You should know that while many 3D printers will accept generic spools, some companies' printers use proprietary spools or cartridges.
Other materials used in FDM printing include materials, such as TPU, TPE, HIPS, PC, NYLON, ASA, PP, PETG, and PVA. Each material has a different melting point, so the use of these materials is limited to the printers designed for them. If you want to use non-metallic powders such as polyamide or alumina you should choose a printer with an SLS process. For metallic powders, DMLS technology is used. Another type of material would be resins where technologies such as polyjet and stereolithography (SLA) are used.
Resolution The resolution of a 3D printer is an indicator of its print quality. A lower resolution results in better details in the print. Resolutions of up to 50 or 70 microns can be found in high-quality printers.
Printing area
Confirm that the build area of a 3D printer is large enough for the type of parts you want to print. The build area determines, in three dimensions, the most prominent part size that can be created on a given printer. The build area on most common 3D printers varies between 6 and 9 square inches, but on some axes, it can vary by a few inches.
platform type It is considered a good platform when the part adheres to it during printing but allows the part to be easily removed after printing is finished. a prevalent configuration is a heated glass platform covered with blue painter's tape or a similar platform. In this configuration, the part sticks reasonably well to the tape and is easy to remove when printing is finished."

Updated: Feb 11, 2022
Nowadays, there’s a variety of options to purchase a 3D printer according to the desired manufacturing process. Retailers like Amazon, Chinese online stores and retailers focused on 3D printing are some of them. In this article we will be discussing in depth a selection of retailers and their strengths and weaknesses, to ensure our customers make the right choice.
Amazon
On Amazon, you can find commercial printers with fair prices and their shipping service is fast, and you can always count on Amazon’s reliable and complacent service. Amazon also offers ease of use across its platforms, and the majority of Amazon customers are already familiarized with the buying process.
Chinese Online Stores (e.g. AliExpress, Gearbest and Banggood)
These stores offer printers at much lower prices, but it’s important to take into account that your printer can get detained in customs, depending on the shipping destination, and it’s highly probable that you’ll pay custom taxes for it. In order to avoid extra charges due to customs it’s recommended to check the warehouse locations these vendors utilize, in order to ask for shipping from a warehouse nearby, although this can represent an extra cost.
AliExpress may have lower prices than Amazon or other stores,but you should always keep in mind those hidden added costs. As for the platform usability, AliExpress is sometimes hard to use because the translation of the products from the Chinese language is not always accurate. Moreover, its return policy allows you to ask for a refund in a period of 15 days after the shipping has been done, but in some occasions the return cost is greater than the product price.
Gearbest is best known for its wholesale of electronics. This site offers various sales and discounts frequently, but customs should also be taken into account. Its website is easy to use and shipping can take anywhere between a couple of days up to 20 days or more depending on the shipping destination and the warehouse location. It offers a refund period of 30 days, but the customer has to cover the shipping and refund fees.
Banggood offers a variety of products and international shipping. They constantly do sales on printers, so it's a good option to compare and choose the best price. It offers ease of use, although the product descriptions can be confusing. The shipping can take between 5 and 50 days, depending on the warehouse. You have up to 30 days to request a refund, but you need to cover the refund fees. In case of product defects you have up to 7 days for a full refund.
3D printers retailers
Besides the aforementioned online retailers, 3D printer retailers offer professional grade printers. If you plan on buying from a retailer, keep in mind their warehouse locations because even if they offer international shipping, it’s calculated depending on your location. It’s important to take this into account since it can mean longer shipping and higher costs.
Because of these reasons, M Aerospace RTC has been focusing through the years on advising enterprises and individuals that are looking for a 3D printer either for personal, professional or industrial use, offering a grand variety of technologies available and prices that fit every budget (ranging from $5,000 MXN up to $500,000 USD). If you are not sure about which printer is ideal for you or your company, do not hesitate to contact an advisor at contact@maerospacertc.com. We’re happy to answer your questions and make sure you make the best decision in terms of price, materials and technologies."

https://www.maerospacertc.com/post/your-essential-3d-print-quality-troubleshooting-guide,"Your Essential 3D Print Quality Troubleshooting Guide
Just ran into 3D printer problems? Looking for ways to simplify 3D printing? Well, you have just come across the perfect 3D print quality troubleshooting guide! Through this guide, you will learn about the most common 3D printer problems and how to solve them in some quick, easy ways!
First Layer Issues
When learning how to 3D print, the most common printing issues stem from a poor foundational first layer. The most important layer is the first layer, as it provides the proper adhesion to the build plate. Some common issues when tackling the first layer are that the nozzle is too close to the print bed, or that the nozzle is too far away from the bed. You can adjust the nozzle to the bed by:
Try to tighten some of the leveling screws on your printer or use a thicker paper stock to manually level your printing bed.
Adjusting your z-offset value if using a print bed leveling sensor (avoid pressing down on the bed when leveling).
By using either of these two steps you can easily fix your initial printing problems before you get started on your quality 3D print!
Print's Not Sticking
Your print not sticking to the bed is hands down one of the most common 3D printing problems, but not to worry, this will help you prevent any 3D print fails you may have already faced! These are some of the various causes and solutions to your bed adhesion failing:
Platform is warped
○ You can fix this by printing a very thick first layer or printing with a raft.
You need to clean your bed
○ De-grease your bed surface using isopropyl alcohol or pure acetone regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Print temperature is off
○ Printing colder will decrease adhesion, while printing hotter (to an extent) will increase adhesion. Follow the recommended print temperatures for your specific printer.
These are the 3 main reasons as to why your print is not sticking to your bed. Try out these solutions to avoid any future 3d print errors you might encounter when your print isn't sticking!
Warping
Although warping is fairly easy to resolve, we know it is one of the most common 3D print problems that is the most frustrating during a print. Here are some different ways to fix your print from warping:
Balance the printing and room temperature. Try printing at a cooler temperature depending on the initial print temperature to improve your 3d print quality.
Print thinner layers to reduce stress on your part during the printing process.
Avoid setting your bed temperature in close proximity to the filament’s glass transition temperature.
If you take these tips to prevent warping into consideration and give them a try you should be able to fix your warping 3D print issues!
Overheating
One of the worst and ugliest forms of bad 3D prints is caused by overheating. When the filament becomes too hot and isn't cooling enough, overheating occurs. Here are ways to fix and prevent overheating as becoming one of your 3D printer issues:
Increase the part cooling fans.
Try printing at a cooler temperature to begin with.
Print slower to give the print time to cool down.
Set a timer per layer to ensure cooling if you have the ability to do so."

NOTA IMPORTANTE
Agitar bien antes de usar
ALMACENAMIENTO
1) Mantener alejado de la luz y sellado a temperatura ambiente. (Sunshine contiene una cierta cantidad de luz UV que solidifica la resina fotosensible. Dentro de la máquina, las resinas ANYCUBIC no se verían afectadas durante más de 48 horas si no es luz UV).
2) Se recomienda almacenar la resina por debajo de 15 C – 35 C en un recipiente sellado.
Evita cualquier ambiente húmedo o polvo.
3. Impresión DLP para elegir la resina UV correspondiente.
Antes de elegir las resinas anycubic para su propia impresora 3D, por favor confirme que la longitud de onda UV de su impresora 3D es de 405 nm. Podemos no ser responsables de daños causados por el incor.
USO
1) Agitar bien antes de usar. Evitar cualquier luz solar directa durante el uso.
2) No poner en la boca. Mantenlo alejado de los niños.
3) Lleve los guantes antes antes de su uso para evitar el contacto directo con la piel y mantener la habitación ventilada.
4) Para contacto accidental, por favor, lavar con agua de forma inmediata. Busca asesoramiento médico si es necesario.
5) Los modelos terminados son necesarios para limpiar con alcohol de alta concentración (>95%) unos 30 segundos y el proceso de postcuración puede ser necesario para una mayor dureza.
6) Por favor, filtra la resina residual en la parte trasera del recipiente si no se utiliza más de 48 horas. La resina residual contaminada causaría problemas de impresión.
