As a result, there is a growing demand for cybersecurity. However, with so many different vendors available for IT security, it can be difficult for businesses to know where to start and which vendors to trust.
The Top 4 Mistakes IT Leaders Make When Hiring IT Security Vendors
- Not understanding the big picture: Securing your business is more than good antivirus. To have all your budget tied up into the best antivirus, but not have a solution for other areas like email phishing, is a mistake.
- Not starting with the end in mind: You must identify “what data are we trying to protect, what would our financial liability be if we are breached, and would this threat most likely come from internal employee, an outside criminal, or both”.
- Purchasing the best cybersecurity products: The best cybersecurity product might sound good, but adding multiple vendors, each responsible for their own area, creates a complex system with expensive integrations into a SIEM.
- Getting sold on features instead of outcomes: Salespeople will get you hooked on how their product has the best feature, but if that feature does not integrate with the rest of your cybersecurity stack, you are creating manual processes that will lead to a slower incident response.
5 Challenges Having Too Many IT Security Vendors in Your Cybersecurity Stack
As we learned the hard way, having too many IT vendors can be problematic for several reasons.
First, the more vendors you have, the harder it is to prove compliance. Being able to prove each mailbox, server, and computer has the appropriate protection across all vendors is time consuming.
Second, installing and updating different products across thousands of computers takes time. Fixing installation issues is a nightmare and is cumbersome on your engineers.
Third, having multiple vendors is more expensive. With each vendor getting a smaller piece of the pie, you have less leverage and are less important which makes it harder to negotiate better pricing.
Fourth, your vendors do not work with each other. Instead, each vendor sends you the alerts, and it is up to you to triage and know what to do with it. IT become the router between vendors, and no one talks to each other.
Fifth, dealing with vendors is not always easy. We service customers across the United States, and our point of contact changes depending on what city or state the customer was located.
What Our IT Security Vendor Consolidation Looked Like
Using a formula, we downsized from ten to three vendors. This took us 57 days and a lot of research, webinars, and hands on trial licenses. While some may argue that there are better products in specific areas, overall, we have simplified our security offering, provided a learning path for engineers, and have gained efficiencies through product integrations.
Conclusion
In conclusion, consolidating vendors helps to reduce costs, streamline processes, and improve security. If you want to learn the specifics of our vendor consolidation process, keep an eye out for a new post that will review exactly what products we were using and the changes we made."
12,https://etsworks.com/cybersecurity/bloomington-normal-illinois-ransomware-protection/,"Ransomware is one of the most dangerous cyber threats, and it affects people, businesses, governments, and critical infrastructure around the world. This article outlines what we learned about the 2020 Ransomware Attack against Baltimore City School District and what Bloomington Illinois and Normal Illinois can do to protect our critical infrastructure.
What is ransomware?
Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts a victim’s data and demands a ransom payment in order to unlock it. It is one of the most dangerous cyber threats and it has become increasingly prevalent in recent years.
Ransomware can be spread through malicious websites, malicious email attachments, and malicious software applications. It can also be spread via infected USB drives, malicious links, and other malicious code.
Once a ransomware attack has been launched, the attacker will demand a ransom payment in order to unlock the encrypted data. The ransom payment is usually paid in the form of cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin.
The danger of ransomware is that even if the ransom payment is made, there is no guarantee that the attacker will actually unlock the encrypted data. In some cases, the attacker may even increase the ransom amount once the payment has been made.
The history of ransomware attacks against municipalities
Ransomware attacks against municipalities are becoming increasingly common. In 2020, there were a number of high-profile ransomware attacks against municipalities around the world, including a major attack against the City of Baltimore.
The attack against Baltimore was the most damaging ransomware attack against a municipality in U.S. history. The attackers encrypted the city’s data and demanded a ransom payment of $75,000. The city refused to pay the ransom and instead resorted to restoring its network from backups.
The attack caused significant disruption to the city’s operations and cost the city an estimated $18 million in recovery costs. It also highlighted the vulnerability of municipal networks and the need for better cybersecurity measures.
Other municipalities have also been targeted by ransomware attacks, including the cities of Atlanta and Greenville, North Carolina. In both cases, the attackers demanded ransom payments of $51,000 and $1.2 million, respectively.
The dangers of ransomware against the Bloomington/Normal community
The Bloomington/Normal community is not immune to ransomware attacks. In fact, the community is at an increased risk due to its reliance on critical infrastructure such as water and electricity.
If a ransomware attack were to be successful, it would have a devastating effect on our community. The attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive data, disrupt essential services, and cause financial losses.
The attack could also have a psychological impact on the community. Residents of the community could be left feeling vulnerable and uncertain about their safety.
Therefore, it is essential that the Bloomington/Normal community takes steps to protect itself from ransomware attacks.
Protecting critical infrastructure from ransomware attacks
The first step in protecting critical infrastructure from ransomware attacks is to ensure that all devices are patched and up-to-date. Regularly patching devices will ensure that any known vulnerabilities are addressed and reduce the risk of a successful attack.
The second step is to ensure that all users are aware of the potential dangers of ransomware and are trained to identify suspicious emails and websites. This will ensure that users are less likely to fall victim to phishing attacks, which are often used to spread ransomware.
The third step is to use a robust managed detection & response (MDR) to protect against malware. This will ensure that any malicious software is detected and removed before it can cause damage.
The fourth step is to ensure that all backups are regularly updated and securely stored. This will ensure that in the event of a successful attack, any data that has been encrypted can be quickly restored. Leading edge backup solutions like DATTO can scan your backups for ransomware, ensuring ransomware does not infect your recovery strategy.
The fifth step is to implement anti phishing email security which can spot emails that are pretending to be from a known vendor or internal employee. Phishing is top way cybercriminals gain access to municipality networks to spread ransomware.
The sixth step is to remove your critical infrastructure from the internet. Being disconnected from the internet is the most powerful way to keep critical infrastructure protected. If this is not possible, having a controlled access point into the network, one that can fully scan encrypted traffic, provide sandboxing, and covers 100% of the MITRE Attack framework is an absolute must.
Finally, it is important to ensure that the community has a robust incident response plan in place. This will ensure that the community is prepared to respond quickly and efficiently to any ransomware attack.
In addition to the steps above here are ways to protect our infrastructure from ransomware attacks:
- Vendor consolidation: Having fewer but more capable IT security vendors will simplify your operation and create stronger alignment around your cybersecurity objectives.
- Managed Detection & Response (MDR): MDR is proactive in nature and constantly monitors for potential threats, while antivirus is reactive and only detects known malware after it has entered your system.
- Network Detection & Response (NDR): NDR is proactive in nature and scans east/west traffic (connections already passed your firewall and moving within your network) and leverages artificial intelligence to identify what the traffic is and is it malicious.
- Multifactor Authentication: Requiring a second form of authentication, such as a fingerprint or a code sent to a mobile device, makes it more difficult for cybercriminals to gain access to an account.
- Conditional Access: Restrict access to sensitive data based on specific conditions, such as device type, location, and network.
- Penetration Testing: Regular penetration testing identifies vulnerabilities and weaknesses in your security defenses. By knowing your weaknesses, it allows IT leaders to secure the budget needed to close security holes.
- File Encryption: Classify data to only be accessible by specific individuals. If information leaves your network, whether it was stolen on a thumb drive or sent digitally through email or a file sharing service, that data cannot be opened because it is encrypted on the file level.
- Cybersecurity Taskforce: A cybersecurity taskforce is crucial for protecting against new and emerging threats. The importance of identifying changes in the cybersecurity industry is critical to staying ahead of cybercriminals.
Our top list of municipalities which experienced ransomware attacks
- The ransomware attack on the city of Baltimore in 2019 caused significant disruption to city services, including the city’s 911 system and email servers.
- The ransomware attack on the city of Atlanta in 2018 resulted in the city having to pay a ransom of $51,000 to regain access to its data.
- The ransomware attack on the city of Newark in 2020 caused disruption to the city’s email and phone systems, as well as other online services.

The community also has access to a number of excellent local IT service providers who specialize in protecting against ransomware. By taking advantage of these resources, businesses and individuals can ensure that their systems are secure and their data is safe."
13,https://etsworks.com/cybersecurity/cybersecurity-laws-car-dealerships-must-follow-to-avoid-legal-action/,"As cybercrime rises, more business are being required to meet cybersecurity compliance, and car dealerships are no exception. This guide will explain three cybersecurity laws car dealerships must follow to lower your financial liability if a security breach was to occur.
Enforceable Cybersecurity Laws You Need to Know
- The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA): Enforced nationwide by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
- Regulatory penalties: The FTC and any other regulatory agency can investigate and fine up to $11,000 per violation.
- Customer lawsuits: Customers whose data is leaked from a breach of your systems can file a lawsuit for damages.
- Criminal charges: If proven institution knowingly violated the GLBA, criminal charges may be filed, resulting in fines and imprisonment for responsible individuals.
- The Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA): Enforced by the Illinois State Attorney General.
- Regulatory penalties: The Illinois Attorney General can investigate and impose penalties up to $50,000 for each violation.
- Customer lawsuits: Like with the GLBA, customers reserve the right to file for damages.
- Illinois Personal Information Disclosure Act (PIDA): Enforced by the Illinois State Attorney General.
- Notify customers: Car dealerships must notify customers of a data breach and pay for a minimum of one year of credit monitoring.
- Notify state: If the data breach includes over five hundred Illinois residents, the car dealership must notify the Attorney General.
- Lawsuits: Your customers can file lawsuits against you for not protecting their personal data.
The Biggest Mistake Care Dealerships Make Trying to Meet Compliance
- Not approving the entire solution: If IT recommends a solution, and you only allow them to implement part of it, and then you are breached, who is responsible?
- Not holding employees accountable to new ways: Compliance is equally about the technology deployed as it is the employees following your standards. You must have proper training and hold staff accountable if business processes are not followed.
- Not consolidating IT security vendors: Check out our blog article on the challenges of having too many cybersecurity vendors.
Our Advice for Illinois Car Dealerships Not Knowing Where to Start
- Start with the basics: Implement essential cybersecurity practices such as updating your computers, installing endpoint protection software, and backing up your data.
- Expand to email protection: Implement an email security solution that protects against spam and phishing attacks. Deploy two-factor authentication and setup security awareness training for your staff.
- Perform a security assessment: Identify which employees and computers access sensitive information, confirm if any computers do not meet security standards, and put a plan together to resolve security holes.
- Replace legacy hardware and encrypt: Computers running “Windows Home” need upgraded to “Pro”, computers without TPM chips/end of life need replaced and encrypt all computers to protect from physical theft.
- Build compliance documentation: Create documents outline your business processes that also meet cybersecurity requirements.
Conclusion for Illinois Car Dealerships
With cyber threats such as ransomware on the rise, car dealerships are at risk of losing customer trust, financial loss, regulatory fines, and legal lability. It is critical for car dealerships to increase their cybersecurity posture and protect customer data from theft."
14,https://etsworks.com/cybersecurity/email-security/importance-of-protecting-company-data/,"In 2022, nothing is more important than keeping your company data safe.
Breach vulnerability is at an all-time high. Protective measures need to be put in place to set up a safety net against breaches, unauthorized access, and data spills.
What is a data spill?
According to wikipedia,
” A data breach is a security violation, in which sensitive,
protected or confidential data is copied, transmitted,
viewed, stolen or used by an individual
unauthorized to do so.”
A small or large company needs to protect its website, database, and computers. It’s important to have these safety measures in place to avoid company loss or corruption.
Implementing data security solutions is critical so that you can protect your company assets from potential cyber attacks.
Everyone Is At Risk
There are so many factors that come into play when it comes to data security. It is hugely important for all companies out there to protect themselves.
Small companies: You may think you are too small to be at risk. This is simply not true. Hackers attack everywhere, from inside and outside company walls. Sneaky hackers target all kinds of companies. In fact, a small company that is growing can potentially suffer the most from cyber attacks. They are at risk due to not having enough immediate resources available to resolve attacks.
Large companies: You might think that your large company can handle the fall-out of an attack due to stronger financials. However, financing isn’t the only thing at risk-data breaches are a massive issue. Cyber attacks can cause major damage, and they should not be ignored. It is important to have strong data security solutions in place for your company’s protection.
Data Is A Company Asset You Can’t Afford To Lose
All companies also have wealth in the very information about their business itself.
This can include information on the services and products you offer. It also includes:
- Financial plans
- Business plans
- Design plans and concepts
- Client information
- Customer information and data
- A data breach would directly hurt your revenue, future benefits, and affect the overall plans for enhancing your company.
It is of the utmost importance to protect your business’s confidentiality and to secure company data in order to protect the assets of your company.
Avoid The Breach
Your company is responsible for any data loss that you may suffer. This could include protecting the financial details and confidential customer information files. It also includes your employee’s information.
You want your company to be reliable and trustworthy. You want to continue to develop growth opportunities.
So, what can a company do?
They can take a few steps, like:
- Improving business mobile security by maintaining an accurate record of company-owned mobile devices
- Protecting business assets with technology business solutions
Employees are using personal laptop for work, so they must be protected, too.
Attacks Are Automatic
Hackers are smart, unfortunately. They can remotely automate huge cyber attacks.
These are called “bot attacks”. It’s a way in which the attacker can utilize an automated system of web requests to quickly manipulate data, break into personal devices, steal, control, or disrupt a company’s website.
Hackers have ways of distracting your security to get into your system undetected. This is why you need real pros to come in with a data security solution for your company.
Integrity and Value
Your company wants to provide the best services and products out there. You want to take pride in your company and honor your customers.
Your customers trust you with their credit cards and personal information. While no one would risk their customer’s private information intentionally, by not having a protection in place you are in fact opening the door to risks of dangers that exposes data. Data leaks are real and they will negatively affect your company’s reputation – and leaks only take a second to occur.
Staying Safe
Data should be as free from computer breaches as much as possible, from both inside and outside sources. Employers can use firewalls to restrict employees’ access to sensitive data.
ETS can provide breach prevention by developing a security system that is as protected as possible.
This includes these steps towards preventing data breaches:
- Developing a protection strategy against a data spill
- Cloud service and protections for all types of data breaches
- Employee safeguarding through training and background checks
- Company laptop policies and employee app data security
- Data storage to protect sensitive information
- Disposal of data that is safe
- Malware protection to keep emails safe
- Strong encryption settings to protect your company’s wireless networks
- Password management and strengthening
- Device protection for you and your employees, and smartphones security
- Constant software updates and security back ups for complete protection
In Closing
Your company must make preventing a breach of security the highest priority.
ETS can add extra layers of sensitive information protection to keep you and your company safe from unauthorized access to your company data, systems, and equipment. With so many employees working remotely, mobile security for business is a top concern, too.
Every size company is at risk of being a target of hackers. Do not allow your company to have a vulnerable security system – you need protective measures in place asap. compared to big companies.
So, reach out to ETS – we are here to help you stay safe from damaging data breaches because your data security means everything to you – and us."
15,https://etsworks.com/cybersecurity/how-to-setup-cisco-meraki-with-implicit-deny/,"How we setup firewalls for small business and what you will learn in this article
This article applies to all Cisco Meraki firewall models and will teach you how to setup an implicit deny rule (and explain why all small business IT setups should be configured this way).
What is implicit deny and why should you care?
Implicit deny means all network traffic is denied unless allowed by your firewall rules. By starting with implicit deny, IT admins can protect against improper firewall configurations that will lead to unauthorized traffic traversing through your network. The challenge is Cisco Meraki firewall rules use the “ANY” object for both internal and WAN, so without ANY, that VLAN is unable to route to the internet.
What traffic would an implicit deny firewall rule block?
The answer is everything is blocked unless explicitly allowed. But when doing your firewall setup Cisco Meraki does not support default denied, so your IT admin probably creates the rules with something like this:
This creates two main issues:
- New VLANs automatically inherit the “ANY to ANY” rule, giving it unrestricted access to your network.
- You always have more deny rules than allow, sometimes many more making it difficult to audit.
Now when a customer asks for a new guest WIFI network to be created, that network has access to everything unless the IT team remembers to create a deny firewall rule. This is considered a very weak security posture and will lead to a human error which could cause a data breach.
How to setup Implicit Deny in Cisco Meraki MX firewall rules (step by step guide)
- Login to Meraki dashboard and head to “Security & SD-WAN” and “Addressing & VLANs“.
- Under “Routing” enable “VLANs” and create 3 VLANs that cover the RFC1918 private address subnets.
- 192.168.1.0/24
- 10.10.1.0/24
- 172.16.30.0/24
- Note: You can have as many VLANs as you want, just as long as 3 VLAN’s cover class A, B, and C subnets.
- Go to “Organization” and “Policy Objects” and under “All Objects” create the following:
- Class A: 10.0.0.0/8
- Class B: 172.16.0.0/12
- Class C: 192.168.0.0/16
-
- Now select “Groups” and click “Add New” and create the following:
- Give it a name (Implicit Deny) or (RFC-1918)
- Add the Class A, B, and C objects into this group.
-
- Go to “Security & SD-WAN” and “Firewall” and set the following rules:
- Top rule is Meraki to ALL (this enables dashboard tools to work as expected).
- Note: Make sure you set Meraki switches and wireless to use your Meraki infrastructure VLAN.
- Configure the VLANs you want to communicate with each other.
- Examples: Private to Private, Private to Printers, Private to Servers
- Then set your implicit deny above the default rule “Allow ANY to ANY”.
-
These basic firewall rules empower your security posture in a few ways:
- You now have less rules for your firewall to process, increasing throughput performance.
- When a new VLAN is created it will have internet access but cannot reach any other VLAN.
- You have a stronger security posture against human error.
- It is easier to audit/test firewall rules.
Things to consider when doing implicit deny
- Meraki support operates with the assumption you have implicit allow (default rule).
- When setting up the client VPN for Cisco Meraki remember to add an allow rule on your firewall or it will not work.
- Make sure you configure your switches and WAPs to use the VLAN which has access to the entire network so the dashboard tools work.

16,https://etsworks.com/cybersecurity/insider-threat-cybersecurity/,"Do you know what internal cybersecurity threats are?
Internal cybersecurity threats are acts that have the goal of disrupting computer systems with harmful intentions. They are often caused by the careless actions of company employees, or by the actual malicious intent of an employee -past or present.
A disgruntled employee can cause a massive internal cyber threat that can involve theft of data or intellectual property. This can damage a company’s reputation.
So how can your company protect itself from employee cybersecurity threats?
Internal Threats Are Real
Internal cyber threats are very common, unfortunately. In fact, most cybersecurity threats originate within a company’s own organization.
Internal threats are very difficult to locate and detect. The insider is aware of the ins and outs of a company and has legitimate access to data and property. This makes it especially difficult to detect insider threats. Employees are often quite careful about being caught, and can in fact cover up their activity easily for a long period of time.
Internal actors can wreak pure havoc on your organization, leaving your sensitive data at risk.
Identifying Internal Actors
Often internal actors are current employees or previous employees that may have a reason to cause harm.
These insiders have authorized access to your organization’s data and resources. Things like your company facilities, equipment, systems, networks, and your sensitive data are all at risk.
There are many cyber insider threat examples to be aware of.
Example of insider threats:
- A former employee or department leader with insider knowledge about business plans. This may be due to an employee seeking revenge for their termination.
- Current employee with log on info to be able to access sensitive information, like employee’s personal info.
- Product developers or service providers. They have had enough access to understand some of the internal workings of your corporation.
- A contractor that your organization has given authorized access to data, networks and systems. This could include technicians or repair people.
- Sometimes the threat is from an inside agent that is working as a spy. The sabotage actors attempt to steal vital company information for the competition. (corporate sabotage)
Types Of Insider Threats in Cybersecurity
There are many different kinds of insider threat indicators to be aware of. While some threats are from a dishonest actor, sometimes unintentional insider threats occur.
A careless employee making an error can account for a huge percentage of internal threats. They may have mishandled some company data or were reckless with security or applications. They may be lazy or refuse to follow your company’s cybersecurity protocols.
Another insider threat can occur when an employee accidentally exposes your corporation to a risk by clicking on a malicious link or by opening a dangerous attachment in an email unknowingly.
How To Prevent Insider Threats
To lower the risks of internal security threats, your organizations can implement a proactive mitigation program to identify potential insider threat indicators.
The focus for your organization should be to first identify a potential threat, and then to assess how to manage that risk. You can implement insider threat training for employees – that is also crucial. This can help to prevent dangerous attacks before they occur.
Your organization can focus on several points for insider threat management and prevention:
- Identity: Your organization should utilize an IT professional to locate and identify potential risk areas.
- Access: A surefire way to prevent insider attacks is to secure the internal access controls. You should have strong encryption for data protection.

17,https://etsworks.com/cybersecurity/is-zero-trust-just-another-buzz-word-for-cybersecurity/,"Zero Trust is one of the hottest cybersecurity buzzwords out there these days. So what exactly created the buzz behind this cyber term, and is it just a passing fad?
First, let’s define what zero trust is…
What Is Zero Trust?
Zero trust is a cybersecurity term that refers to a specific security solution, designed as a complete security framework.
John Kindervag, a Forrester research analyst, was the person who coined the phrase. The term zero trust became more popular when he introduced the idea that an organization should create safe cybersecurity models – and not trust anyone inside or outside the organization’s perimeters.
This new framework uses zero trust encryption. It requires that all users of an organization’s network be authenticated and authorized. It continuously monitors the connection for the best security configuration possible. It provides trust and security for accessing an organization’s data and applications.
Is Zero Trust The Future of Cybersecurity?
Zero Trust is more than just a hot term. It’s really a complete cyber mindset.
The zero trust security model tightens up any existing weak points in an organization’s perimeter. Zero trust is a cybersecurity architecture that protects access for users, their devices, and systems. This allows an organization to easily isolate cyber traffic until a proper level of trust is established.
These days, companies are being overwhelmed by messages from IT vendors offering Zero Trust solutions. But, is this access model and level of security needed? Is it a passing trend, or is it here to stay?
The reality is that zero trust is here to stay, and completely necessary for protection.
When COVID-19 hit, companies soon realized that they needed to quickly modernize their cyber infrastructure. Some companies improved their existing remote access framework by adding licenses and capacity. What was really needed was a completely new approach.
Facts on cybersecurity:
- Hybrid working is here to stay, and companies need to protect this – by creating a user-friendly experience that is both safe and accessible.
- Cyberattacks have not gone down, in fact, the numbers of cyberattacks continue to rise
- Outsourcing proper IT security is in high demand, and absolutely needed for the safe access of a company
- Educating employees on Zero Trust is key to success and safety
Zero Trust Challenges
There are many challenges with implementing a trust and verify system. Utilizing an IT company with zero trust certification will give you the opportunity for guidance from experts.
An organization needs assistance to provide a proper model for zero trust identity and access management and best practices.
Zero trust best practices include:
Improving employee experience and reducing difficult operations
Create clear trust systems with cyber visibility
Tighter security around the increase in remote security issues
This required model for security creates a huge amount of work and responsibility for an organization’s IT department – and not all smaller companies have their own IT department.
That’s where ETS comes into play. When a company’s traditional security models aren’t working, ETS sharpens your security with trust models that create a safe zero trust situation.
When a company has employees working partly from home, the highest trust model safety must be implemented. A network must assume that it is at risk at all times from internal and external threats.
The Zero Trust Way
Zero trust is not just a buzzword. Zero trust is a cyber security best practice for all new and existing companies. Zero trust vendors can ensure that the proper individuals are accessing your organization’s resources safely.
Our government has placed high weight on user trust networks, too. The Biden Administration’s updated its cybersecurity strategy for federal agencies and executive departments with an executive order on improving our country’s security.
This strategy builds a trust network architecture for company defense against “increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.”
How to implement zero trust:
1. Hire an IT firm like ETS to create a cybersecurity architecture diagram for you – for complete protection. They understand trust tech, and they can set up a protection model with zero trust implementation that works for you.
2. Provide secure trusted cloud principles with a multi-factor authentication network for top-notch, zero trust security.
3. Create a user-friendly system that gives users quick access to the needed systems and applications that they will utilize – in and out of the office.
4. Educate staff and users on zero authentication and best practices to reduce risky security behavior. Give them a streamlined system that implements an easier sign-on system with no-click access for use of cloud apps.
Network security models with zero trust segmentation of data centers and cloud environments can strengthen your security while being compliant with current regulations. This can minimize potential data breaches.
ETS And Zero Trust Assessment
With guidance from ETS, you will be able to maintain a zero trust security system by building a cyber architecture that is right for your organization.
Together, we can help you embrace network security architectures that protect the integrity of your company, as well as secure your data and access for your employers and users. They entrust you with personal info and deserve to be safe.
A solid IT framework from ETS will get you to a place of zero trust and security excellence."
18,https://etsworks.com/cybersecurity/managed-detection-response-mdr-vs-antivirus/,"With cybersecurity a top priority for lawmakers, one industry has decided to start pushing for change today. Insurance companies, tired of paying out costly cyber insurance claims, are requiring businesses to have Managed Detection and Response (MDR). This blog will examine the differences between MDR and traditional antivirus software and why MDR is a more effective solution for your business.
Key Differences Between Managed Detection & Response (MDR) and Traditional Antivirus
- Detection: Signature based antivirus needs updates to identify malware. But 35% of malware is unknown, so this solution has huge detection gaps. MDR is software installed on computers that analyzes behavior, giving it greater capabilities to identify malware not detectable by antivirus.
- Response: MDR has human threat hunters monitoring your IT systems 24×7. They act on your behalf to eliminate threats and provide a root cause analysis. Antivirus on the other hand sends email alerts to your IT team.
- Remediation: Attacks outside of business hours go un-noticed until IT reviews the alerts, giving hackers time inside your systems. This is why targeted attacks start Friday after hours while everyone is away.
- Capabilities: Antivirus has a narrow focus and is only concerned about the computer. MDR does the same, but also looks at the logs from your firewall, internal network, email service, and third-party applications.
- Investigation: MDR goes far beyond malware detection and can monitor things like impossible travel logins, connections passed through your firewall to malicious domains and IPs, and suspicious lateral movement on your network like ransomware.
- Ransomware: Antivirus might block ransomware if it knows the signature, but a great MDR can detect a process encrypting files, take a backup of that data, remove the ransomware from the system, and then restore the files from the backup.
Standard Features Your Managed Detection & Response (MDR) Should Include
- Complete Solution: All systems monitored 24x7x365. Malware removed until threats fully eliminated with a root-cause analysis. MDR is compatible with all versions of Microsoft Windows, Server, Mac, Linux, and mobile device operating systems.
- Breach Warranty Protection: $1,000,000+ breach warranty included to cover any out of pocket expenses caused by a data breach.
- Advanced Detection: Proven to block known threats, stop unknown threats based on behavior, has technology to eliminate ransomware, and ability to block fileless attacks such as malicious PowerShell scripts.
- Sandboxing: Unknown executables launch in an isolated sandbox to analyze processes before executing on computer.
- Server Lockdown: Identify running processes and applications on server, and nothing new can run on that server unless removed from lockdown mode. Very powerful to protect web servers from malicious attacks.
- Web Filtering: Computers have web traffic and downloads filtered to only allow work related information.
Advanced Features Your Managed Detection & Response (MDR) Should Include
- Phishing Protection: Monthly/quarterly phishing simulation against employees to train your team how to better spot phishing attacks.
- Email Security: Inbound and outbound email is scanned for malicious links and attachments. Attachments are detonated in isolated sandbox prior to opening on computer.
- Security Awareness Training: Quarterly/Annual security awareness training for all employees.
- Email Log Analysis: IP addresses accessing company email, impossible travel logins, and sent/received emails with malicious attachments or links are sent to the MDR provider for analysis.
- Firewall Logging: Websites and domains passing through your firewall are monitored by the MDR team.
- Network Detection & Response: Network traffic moving laterally between devices (on your network) is monitored for suspicious behavior.
- Zero-Trust Posture Checking: Devices cannot access company resources unless a minimum security baseline is established with the MDR provider. This powerful feature ensures devices have 100% compliance before it can access company data.
- Cloud Security: Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, and online code repositories are scanned 24×7 for top attack vectors including over privileged accounts and unsecure open ports.
- Device Control: Block external hard drives, prevent applications from being installed, and control physical hardware components like CD drives and Bluetooth adapters.
- Endpoint Encryption: Full disk encryption deployed to computers to prevent data theft from lost or stolen device.
- Third Party Logging: Ability to ingest logs from 3rd party providers like Duo, Okta, and Mimecast.
Real-World Examples of Enhancing Security by Standardizing with a Single MDR Security Vendor
By consolidating IT security vendors, the follow enhancements were unlocked which we can share the following stories:
- Impossible Travel Login: Mary in Accounting starts work at 8am PST and logged into her email, but 45 minutes later her email was logged in from Florida. This is an “impossible travel login” which an investigation proved was a malicious attack that bypassed MFA.
- Malicious Outbound Email: An email containing a link to a malicious website is sent from the CEO’s email to the accounting department. The MDR vendor detects the malicious link, pin-pointed the computer it came from, opened an investigation, and resolved the security threat on that device.
- Duo Password Spraying Attack: The MDR team receives from a password spray attack from Duo. An investigation is started, and it is discovered an IT team member opened an RDP port on a server on the internet which was resulting in the attack. The MDR vendor reports the incident, and the RDP port is closed, fully eliminating the threat.
- Outbound P2P Traffic: MDR team detected a connection from a file server doing encrypted outbound P2P traffic to an IP not known to be malicious. But outbound P2P traffic was out of character for this server, so an investigation was opened. It was determined an internal IT admin was utilizing the file server for personal purposes and syncing data from this system through a P2P application.
Conclusion
In conclusion, it is essential to protect your business from cyber threats. But where most companies go wrong is they hire multiple IT security vendors, delivering a clunky solution that doesn’t scale and creates IT headaches and inefficiencies. If you want to win in the game of cybersecurity, start by consolidating your IT security vendors and take baby steps to implement a great MDR solution for your business."
19,https://etsworks.com/cybersecurity/protect-from-spam-and-phishing/,"You know that phishing and spam attacks are a massive security challenge for your company. We constantly hear about the consequences of these kinds of attacks in the news.
What can a company do to
keep their information secure?
Hackers Are Everywhere
Hackers will do everything and anything they can to steal your valuable information. Your company’s credit cards, passwords, and sensitive data are prime targets for today’s latest phishing schemes.
Hackers are smart, unfortunately. They try using many different methods to steal this important info. From spam emails to social media – your info is at risk.
All forms of communication provide an open window of opportunity to a hacker to reach your private data, and take it.
This is why your businesses must do everything possible to be safe.
Common Types Of Phishing And Spam
Phishing and spam are both common forms of what is called “social engineering”.
What is social engineering?
Social engineering utilizes and exploits our human psychologically to find unique ways to manipulate a person into accidentally giving access to their personal or company information.
It’s ruthless and all too common.
Some common forms of phishing and spamming are:
- Phishing Email: What is a phishing scam? Well, have you ever accidentally clicked on spam link? A hacker creates an email address that looks just like a legitimate email address for your company (or from a person you trust). Within this email, the hacker will request that the reader clicks on a dangerous link that gives them access to information, data, or systems. They sometimes also ask a reader to change their passwords – or even send money! Dangerous files may be attached and clicked on.
- Executive phishing: This form of attack involves a company email takeover. It has your entire company (executives and management, too) put in real danger. Essentially, a phisher finds a way to acquire an email address and password of a higher up person in your company. They then use these credentials to do an “email bomb spam” or “snowshoe spam” to target all of your company members, colleagues and customers – in one swift shot.
- Clone Phishing: what is clone phishing? For clone phishing (also called spear phishing) a hacker creates a completely fake company name. They use stolen information and data to make things seem very real, then they target an individual in a pitch email that they send to their target. Their spam emails are so incredibly compelling – a victim can easily fall into their trap. Take swift steps to prevent spear phishing and learn what helps protect from spearfishing.
- Barrel Phishing: What is barrel phishing? Barrel phishing is a very common form of attack. With this, the scammer targets a victim with two or more emails. The first email is simple and created as a bait to gain the trust of their victim. They then may think that it came from a trusted source, and be scammed by the second email they receive.
- Phone Phishing: Phone phishing takes advantage of VoIP (voice over internet protocol) technology. Using this technique, the ruthless scammer finds a way to impersonate an individual or a company for their benefit. Their grand scam utilizes confidential data they have hacked, and uses it to scam their target. (For example: a criminal might impersonate your internal tech support to trick your staff into handing over their passwords or data).
What Can You Do To Prevent Phishing And Spam?
A business is especially vulnerable to nasty slam method phishing. Your company image, financials and more can be damaged. It is incredibly important to prevent these phishing and spam attacks as swiftly and effectively as possible.
So what can you do to protect their business email security from these attacks?
Steps to protect you and your company via email:
- Do not open emails from unknown senders. Confirm that the email address is “real” by actually seeing the full address an email is coming from – do this by hovering over it to see the full address. Avoid opening anything from weird email addresses.
- Be cautious with all attachments and do not click links. Links should be a major red flag.
- What is a common indicator of a phishing attempt? Do you see misspellings or strange grammar? These are both common signs of a hack. Report to your IT department immediately.
- Is the email asking for urgent action? Is there a threat of some kind? Avoid all emails like these. Report immediately.
Most of these steps seem like common sense. Take your time with your email. Read through them thoroughly, and in general, if you are concerned, report it.
It’s better to be safe than sorry.
More Steps To Protect Your Company:
- Keep your company passwords safe by using longer/case sensitive passwords. Change your passwords frequently for safety. Insist your employees regularly do. Use authentication for an added step of protection.
- Set up phishing ransomware and spear phishing protection to help you and your employees deal with the risk. It will filter out much of the “junk” email and help to prevent email hacking.
- Regularly have phishing and social engineering training for your employees and staff to train them on measures that they can take to prevent phishing and spamming. This will help them to identify what is a phishing scam. This training can (and does) prevent a large amount of attacks.
- Carefully vet all of your current and new employees. Internal spamming is also a real threat, so you want to be cautious inside and outside of your company walls.
- Utilize a reputable IT security company, like ETS, to add protective phishing filters and software on all of your company devices and websites, This will help to keep your company as safe as possible. This really is your safest bet against dangerous attacks. Many IT companies can also train your employees for you to keep your data extra secure.
Overall Protection
Today’s cyber criminals are ruthless!
These hackers are always finding new and creative ways to access your private company data. They use increasingly sneaky tools – beyond simply opening spam – to convince unknowing individuals to innocently divulge their personal and company information.
Your systems are very vulnerable and can easily be compromised by these spam risks. That’s why it is critical to utilize phishing prevention best practices.
It’s critical to focus on the human element of phishing and spam, while backing this with the latest anti-virus software, phishing ﬁlters and security measures.
Train yourself and your employees on a regular basis, and hire an IT firm like ETS to take the worry out of security. ETS can help give you the highest protection for your company’s confidential and sensitive data.
Let’s keep you safe, together."
20,https://etsworks.com/cybersecurity/what-is-mdr/,"It’s 2023, and cybersecurity has never been more important.
Cyber threats and attacks continue to grow in our workplaces and homes. Hackers seem to be everywhere, and they are relentless.
This is why it is super important that you are aware of all of the technology that is available to protect you and your employees.
Future attacks are preventable, and MDR can be a solution.
What Is MDR? Do I Need It?
Cybersecurity threats to business network security are indeed a huge problem. They need to be constantly monitored. Response must be swift.
So, how can a small company or startup
be constantly aware of threats?
How can a company have a solid resource of people
(and quality technology in place)
to face these threats?
Cybersecurity can be overwhelming, and even confusing. However, it doesn’t need to be. It’s important to try to see beyond the terminology.
Cybersecurity can be less daunting with the aid of real protection. There are protocols and learning processes, like MDR, that can greatly reduce your company’s risk from threats – in a fairly straightforward way.
What is MDR in cyber security?
MDR stands for “managed detection and response”.
What is managed detection and response?
It is a kind of cybersecurity that monitors, finds and responds to threats through the use of both top notch technology and human response. The goal with the employment of security MDR is to rapidly identify and lessen a threat without the use or costs of additional staffing.
The MDR security suite provides protection by a unique use of outsourcing of services of protection. This can allow your business to limit the impact of many cybersecurity threats. These services can be utilized without a huge expansion of your existing security operations, or your number of staff members.
Why MDR Is A Solution
The reality is that most companies do not have the know-how or the resources or budget to face the massive cyber threat challenges facing our world today. Unfortunately, this can lead a company to falling prey to dangerous attacks.
A solution is needed, and mdr cybersecurity is the sensible choice for a company to stay safe against growing threats.
So how does MDR work exactly?
- MDR application: MDR solutions apply the needed technology and expertise to your core network and endpoint systems.
- MDR will deploy: MDR will shield your entire network and its endpoints to block incoming threats and to minimize your vulnerability.
- MDR will detect: Through the use of continual monitoring, your company’s networks and endpoints are secured with mdr tools. Use of an EDR tool protects endpoints. Data identifies cyber incidents with immediate notification.
- MDR will respond: Mdr cyber security will quickly identify and respond to any potential and found threats.
- MDR will fix: MDR allows for swift remediation and response to a threat. Swift action is taken through trigger responses that are automatic. These will eradicate a high-priority threat and reset your system to a safe status.
- MDR will report: An automatically generated report from your MDR service provider will provide the needed details for you in a report for each and every cyber event. This will help to identify your threat, give you info on how and when it occurred, and give you a breakdown of the response that was taken. MDR performance engines will also tell you how the issue was properly resolved.
What Are The Benefits Of MDR?
MDR is a security service that is comprehensive. It gives your company complete protection for your network and endpoints, with top solutions. There are very real benefits for you and your valuable clients and customers.
5 Benefits of MDR:
- Expertise: MDR provides the needed security expertise for your company. Your mdr provider protects your company by identifying threats and dealing with the response to threats, free from the costs of creating your own in-house security operations.
- Frees Up Staff: With MDR, the responsibility is reduced from your employees to solo monitor your systems. It will help you identify, chart and respond to all kinds of cybersecurity threats.
- Cost Reduction: With MDR you do not need the increased expense of employing or training new cybersecurity employees. It saves you from the unbelievable costs of an attack.
- Its A Real Solution: MDR provides pure protection against threats. The constant monitoring and remediation gives you 24/7 protection, which is invaluable.
- It Can Grow With You: MDR is scalable, meaning it will grow with your company to meet your ever-growing and changing needs. It continually improves and expands for you and your customers.
MDR v. MSSP
What about MSSP?
MDR vs MSSP: Simply put, MDR is a more complete security system. MSSP (Managed Security Services Providers) can not cover everything that MDR does.
MSSPs can only provide the detection and alert services of a threat, while MDR also provides the needed response and remediation of those threats. With MSSP, a company must respond by themselves to the business internet security alerts and provide future protection. It is not as thorough as MDR.
MDR is the way to go.
The Cyber Security Reality
In 2023, you absolutely need your company to be fully protected against the incredible sophistication of global cybersecurity threats. They are real and they are constantly growing and evolving.
Alerts to these threats or attacks are not enough. You must be ahead of the game with solid security against instigators, through the use of MDR.

21,https://etsworks.com/cybersecurity/why-your-business-needs-cyber-insurance/,"Did you know that cyber attacks on small businesses are on the rise? Both large and small companies can be affected.
More than 75% of companies have reported being attacked this past year – making this a very real threat:
“During the third quarter of 2022, approximately 15 million data records were exposed worldwide through data breaches. This figure had increased by 37 percent compared to the previous quarter. Since the first quarter of 2020, the highest number of exposed data records was detected in the fourth quarter of 2020, nearly 125 million data sets.”
Small businesses require an online presence to remain relevant, as well as need proper communication with their customers to be conducted on a daily basis. This is why it is vital that you are prepared for cyber attacks.
This is where cyber insurance comes in.
What Exactly Is Cyber Insurance? Why Do I need Cyber Liability Insurance?
Is cyber insurance worth it? How much does cybersecurity insurance cost?
Nothing is more important than protecting your business and seeing it thrive. Every security that is needed should be put in place.
You probably have small business insurance, however, you still should also have cyber insurance. There are very real benefits of cyber insurance.
Cyber insurance (also called cyber liability insurance) is a type of insurance sector security that protects your business from the potential financial and legal issues and liability that could affect you from a cyber incident.
With businesses now so heavily online, you are more susceptible than ever to dangerous cyber attacks and data breaches. The effects of such an attack could destroy your business and your reputation. In fact, it could be a huge legal (and emotional) mess.
“As of 2022, the average cost of a data breach in the United States amounted to 9.44 million U.S. dollars, up from 9.05 million U.S. dollars in the previous year. The global average cost per data breach was 4.35 million U.S. dollars in 2022.” – Statista
The potential loss from an average data breach is massive. Maybe a larger company or corporation could handle this, but most companies of small to medium size cannot. It usually results in complete closure.
Kinds of cyber attacks:
- Hacking
- Phishing attacks
- Malware /ransomware
- DoS or DDoS attacks
- Spyware
This is why data breach insurance coverage is crucial to the success and longevity of your business. It will keep you covered if a security-compromising cyber incident hits your business.
Sensitive customer, employee and client information may be accessed or stolen in an attack. Your cyber insurance will help you to recover and repair.
The Kinds Of Things That Cyber Insurance Protects
The main benefit of cyber security insurance: cyber insurance will cover a huge range of expenses that occur with a cyber attack.
The following costs and services are typically covered:
- Lost or transferred funds
- Recovery Data
- Restoring compromised Data
- Informing those affected by the breach
- Credit monitoring for those breached
- Repairing damaged services
- Computer forensics
- Costs to repair reputation
- Lawsuits expenses
All of these criminal actions are covered by your cyber insurance.
The Kinds Of Things Cyber Insurance Does Not Protect
What does cyber insurance not cover?
There are a few items that are not covered by cyber insurance. These include foreign cyber activity, risk lawsuits from before the attack, reimbursement of any future lost income from an attack, theft of your intellectual properties, and future protections put in place.
The benefits of cybercrime crime insurance coverage make the investment in insurance worth the investment.
Is Cyber Insurance Costly?
Because attacks are so prevalent, security protection is a huge business. The prevalence of breaches is driving up the costs.
So, how high are cybersecurity insurance costs, and how much cyber insurance do I need?
Cyber insurance costs vary based on several factors, like the size of your company and your location.
Main factors that affect the price of your premium:
- Size of business and industry
- Number of employees
- Annual revenue
- Level of desired coverage
- Your deductible costs
- Location of your business
A smaller deductible will raise your insurance premiums.
Ways To Save On You Cyber Insurance And To Increase Protection
There are many things you can do to keep your small business safe which in turn will lower your small business security costs for insurance. Network security for business should be a top priority.
How to prepare for cyber attacks and protect your business:
- Know how to secure a network.
- Identify all potential risks to your business network security and be prepared for any potential issues before they occur.
- Have secure business networks in place. Your insurance provider will reward you for strong security by lowering your premiums.
- Identify how to secure your computer from unauthorized access.
- Protect your company data with employee training and security in place. Store a limited amount of customer data, and use data security best practices.
- Keep your company software and hardware updated, and monitor it regularly.

43,https://etsworks.com/microsoft-365/8-ways-to-secure-your-microsoft-365-email-system/,"Last year Sandy, a 26-year accounting veteran at a large manufacturing plant in the United States, called to figure how her team accidentally wired $460,000 to a fraudulent vendor. You could tell Sandy was very upset and under a lot of pressure from the board of directors. To make matters worse, her team was just moments away from sending a second wire for $172,500, but thankfully the real vendor called just in time asking why the first wire for $460,000 was never received. That is when Sandy realized they might have fallen victim to wire fraud.
Here is how the attack unfolded:
- The accounts payable email had been compromised as follows:
- The attacker had full access to the accounts payable mailbox and was reading all email.
- A known vendor sent an invoice for $460,000 asking for payment.
- Immediately after a second email came in asking to update the bank information before wiring the $460,000.
- Unfortunately the accountant didn’t realize the email had an S on the end (jim@myemail.com vs jim@myemails.com)
- Because the account did not catch this, they updated the payment information and wired the funds to the wrong account.
- The hacker then created a mailbox rule that any emails from that vendor were deleted as to not tip off the accountant.
- Almost 30 days went by before they realized what happened and it was to late for the bank to get the money back.
You might be asking yourself, is phishing illegal? How can someone get away with this? The short answer is yes it is illegal, but most phishing attacks come from outside the United States and pursuing legal action is nearly impossible. But hope is not lost. In fact, there were many things Sandy’s company already owned but the IT team never configured the security settings. This was a hard lesson to learn so please use this guide to save you some heart ache.
For those who prefer video, here is the YouTube link to 8 ways to secure your Microsoft 365 email system, otherwise read on!
Steps To Keep Your Increase Your Microsoft 365 Email Security
Do not set up common department mailboxes: Avoid common Microsoft office business mailboxes like accounting@yourcompany.com, ap@yourcompany.com, hr@yourcompany.com. These are easy for attackers to guess and will lead to more phishing attacks. Instead try 801ap@yourcompany.com, sunflower@yourcompany.com, or something unique that a hacker cannot guess.
Reject external email forwarding: Make sure your Microsoft 365 business email is set to not allow your emails to automatically forward to an external mailbox. A common attack is sending HR a fake resume with a virus, or accounting a fake invoice. This installs a virus which creates a rule that all your emails have a copy sent to hackersemail@gmail.com. Once done the hacker waits for the right moment to strike, which is what happened to Sandy.
Email Phishing Protection with IronSCALES: You might be asking, what is IronSCALES? Simply put, it puts a layer of protection between hackers and your employees. IronSCALES would have displayed a bright red banner that reads “CAUTION: You usually email Jim at jim@myemail.com, but this is coming from jim@myemails.com. This might be an attack, proceed with caution!” IronSCALES would have done more analysis, and without about 12 seconds, flagged it as fraud and immediately removed it from the accounts payable mailbox.
IronSCALES also sends out security training tests to all staff each quarter. If a staff falls for the trick it brings them to a quick training video to learn how to better spot these type of attacks.
Brand your Microsoft 365 Login Page: A branded page with your logo gives your team a visual identifier that they are in the right place. And while a sophisticated attacker could clone your login page, it can help prevent the one-off random attacks and save you a lot of headache.
Enable two factor authentication: When an employee logs into an email for the first time they must use a second factor. This could be a text message (least secure) or the Microsoft Authenticator application (most secure). If your employee falls victim and an attacker gets their password, they still cannot login without the second factor. This is one of the best methods to prevent unauthorized access into your email system.
Configure your SPF record: SPF is a “sender policy framework”. With SPF, 365 can verify that email your employees receive came from a trusted source. This helps prevent fake emails hitting your team and reduces the total amount of times you need to rely on IronSCALES to defend you.
DKIM signatures: DKIM signatures (domain signing) adds a digital signature to the headers in your emails. The signature is validated with the organization’s domain system records. This safety feature also gives your own email a much higher chance of hitting an inbox. It’s a win-win.
Microsoft default settings: There are several go-to settings that are built into Microsoft that your organization should make sure are set up properly within the admin center. Go to the protection setting, then malware feature, and make sure that is “on”.
Also, make sure that the “enable common attachment type filter” and the “enable malware zero autopurge” are both enabled to make sure that those emails are coming through 365 to scan for spam.
You can also change your default setting for “bulk”level to 2 to stop junk mail from getting through, but at the risk of good emails going to junk. In all fairness, if a vendor sends you an email and it does go to junk, it is mostly because they are not setup properly.
General Security Strategies
Keeping your email secure raises so many questions. Everyone – not just organizations – wants to feel safe from scams. Here are some common concerns:
- How to protect my email account from hackers: Use a unique password and do not store this password on any publicly used device. Always log out fully, and use two factor authentication. Be careful logging into public computers and do not click on suspicion links.
- What to do if you open a phishing email: Close the email and mark is as spam. If you are using IronSCALES, use the IronSCALES report phishing button. Do not click any attachments or links and simply delete the email. If you accidentally clicked on anything contact your IT department immediately.
- Can you get hacked by replying to an email: You cannot get a virus from replying to an email. But responding is dangerous because it gives the hacker additional information about your email security, and gives them a window into your mind which could make you targeted in the future. Never egg-on on attacker, it is best to just ignore them and make your IT department aware.
- What to do if you respond to a phishing email: If you accidentally respond to a phishing email, immediately change your passwords and usernames. An attacker can steal your usernames and passwords, your money, your credit card info, and even your bank accounts. Set up new pins and start fresh for safety.
- I opened an email from a hacked account, now what: These days, viruses are everywhere. They are activated when you open attachments or click links. Just opening the email cannot give you a virus, but if you did anything else please let make your IT department aware.
- Ironscales vs Proofpoint: what are they? IronSCALES and Proofpoint are both email security platform tools. Many users think that IronSCALES is easier to use. It’s easy to set up and administer, too.
- I heard that Microsoft will soon block theft. True? Microsoft will be releasing a safety feature soon that will enable a “Microsoft Defender Attack Surface Reduction” (ASR). This rule will be by default in settings. We recommend thorough coverage through multiple layers for complete security for your company.
- Is there a report phishing email Outlook button with IronSCALES? Yes, and when you submit a phishing email, IronSCALES does an investigation and stops the attack from going any further.
- What is the more secure alternative to the smtp mail protocol? Basic authentication from Microsoft 365 is very unsecure as it can bypass multi factor authentication. It is best to use TLS 1.3 along with modern authentication across the board.
Email Security Final Thoughts
You might be asking, are emails secure, or how secure is email? The short answer is, no. Because email relies heavily on humans to make the correct decision, attackers will continue to evolve to take advantage. Anyone can simply Google “how to hack an email address” and be returned with office 365 phishing email examples, email hacker tools, and different ways to try and get into m365 exchange online. It is no wonder why securing email servers have become a full time job.

45,https://etsworks.com/mortgage-firms/easy-tips-for-client-communication/,"Security Service Mortgage Loans
Did you know that almost 75% of mortgage firms are operating their business with severely compromised communication with clients?
Sensitive financial and personal information is being sent in a rather risky way.
Both small and large mortgage firms are utilizing unsecured email accounts to send files. This is a huge problem for everyone involved. It puts the consumers at risk, and it puts the mortgage firm and their online business security at risk, too. Not to mention, it is also a violation of the FTC Safeguards Rule to send secure loan documents and files in an unsafe way.
The FTC Safeguard rule states that a firm can only send sensitive materials when encrypted. Lenders need to utilize a secure portal to transmit sensitive documents.
So how can lenders send the sensitive information that they need to send at the rate needed in a secure and safe way?
How can they prevent a data breach?
Sharing Mortgage Loan Documents
Mortgage paperwork seems endless, right?
Faxing and emailing is a thing of the past. Your applicants probably don’t even have a fax machine. Asking them to hunt one down is inconvenient. It also takes too much time to scan and then store sensitive documents.
So, an obvious quick solution for a loan officer is to email their clients, right? Not so fast.
Emailing seems like a super fast way to send files, like a client’s application, title, closing work, or appraisal documents. But, the reality is that emailing documents isn’t always safe.
Email is too easily accessed by multiple servers and individuals. It’s compromised.
Encrypting seems like an obvious choice, and many providers like Gmail or Outlook have HTTPS or SSL as their default setting. However, these settings do not encrypt the sensitive contents in an email, which in turn compromises lender confidentiality.
You need a secure small business network, backed by a top-notch IT team to keep things running safely and smoothly.
The Risks Of Mortgage Document Management
When a client is applying for a mortgage, a massive amount of private information is being sent back and forth to their lender. This info is all needed, but highly sensitive.
A client’s application could require that the following private info is sent:
- Name
- Addresses
- Driver’s license/photo ID
- Social security number
- Employment info/Pay-stubs
- Bank statements/Asset info
- Tax returns
There are many people in the lending process services that see this info, from the main loan officer – all the way to the closing department team.
Applicants may give their permission for this info to be sent because they know that it’ll speed up the process – it feels convenient – but no one feels safe.
The reality is that consumers feel less and less safe, and feel dissatisfied with how their personal info is being transmitted and protected.
What About The Cloud?
There is always the option of using a private Dropbox for sharing these sensitive documents. Uploading sms mortgage info to a Dropbox account is relatively simple.
But is it safe? Could it be considered a violation of compliance rules?
This method lacks the protections required by most IT departments to keep the client and their information safe. Unauthorized use of private cloud accounts can happen, too.
Did you know that some of the worst culprits of data breaches in business network security are a firm’s own employees?
It’s not always from malicious intent that causes breaches – it’s usually just basic human error. It’s unavoidable.
A lender needs a secure portal for effective client communication, that allows for a secure way to send and store sensitive documents.
How to Speed Up Mortgage Applications Safely
A mortgage approval process that is smooth and fast for a client keeps the customer happy and it also benefits the lender. It can help to build a profitable bottom line.
Happy borrowers = happy homeowners in less time.
So how can sending secure loan docs be done safely? By developing a network security for business.

46,https://etsworks.com/mortgage-firms/microsoft-teams-is-future-for-voip/,"Choosing tech tools is always a hot topic, and today there are more options than ever. When it comes to communication, Microsoft Teams, paired with VoIP, is a safe and wise choice.
The Key Is Communication
Mortgage lending requires constant communication. Businesses find it easiest to connect as a team through the use of Microsoft Teams with Microsoft Teams voice, for collaborating and communicating online.
VoIP Microsoft Teams is quickly becoming the number one choice for internal communication in a business – for businesses looking to connect their virtual workers from multiple locations.
Conveniences of Microsoft Teams for VoIP
So, what exactly is VoIP?
VoIP is “Voice over Internet Protocol”. Simply put, VoIP is a technological tool that allows you and your team to make voice calls. These calls use a broadband Internet connection, not a traditional phone line.
So, why is this important?
VoIP allows for simplicity. At virtually any given moment, a business colleague can quickly send a fellow worker a message, and then follow it up easily with a call on Teams.
It’s easy to use, and fast!
With VoIP, communication with internal agency personnel is a breeze.
What Are The Benefits of VoIP and Microsoft Teams?
There are many clear benefits to utilizing VoIP. Your employees are able to take a simple one-on-one phone call and turn it into a team call – in seconds – with integrated voice, video, and screen sharing, with the share screen on Microsoft teams.
More incredible benefits include:
Overall lower call costs
Less equipment needed
More control over communication
Ease of use of the Microsoft teams web browser
No lost time by using multiple portals
App for use on-the-go with mobile phones
Increase productivity – no more internal barriers to communication
Secure calls with high quality
Auto attendants available
The flexibility and ease of use with VoIP and Microsoft Teams is ideal for mortgage lenders. It easily connects all the players from their landline, their mobile device, or their Teams app.
With Microsoft teams, everything is easily organized and connected, such as Microsoft teams conference calls, messaging, chats, videos, etc. Voicemail is now available for all VoIP-enabled users in Microsoft teams, too.
Microsoft teams shifts all internal communication plans into one spot. Everything can be easily tracked in one unified location, which allows a company to have improved productivity and control.
What About Zoom? or Skype? or Google Meet?
With so many options out there, it is natural to have questions about which products to use for your organization.
Zoom vs Microsoft teams vs Google Meet:
Microsoft teams vs Skype: Both Teams and Skype were developed by Microsoft. All communications (voice, video, file transfers, and instant messages) are encrypted on both. However, when considering Microsoft teams vs Skype for business, it is important to note that Teams has stronger security features – critical in mortgage lending.
Microsoft Teams vs Google Meet: Microsoft Teams has a better overall value for the price than Google Meet. Microsoft 365 subscriptions give you access to both web and their mobile app, in addition to their Microsoft Office products.
Microsoft Teams vs Zoom: Zoom is generally preferred for external meetings. Teams is preferred for connecting internal meetings. The integration that Teams offers with its Office 365 products allows for one-stop-shopping.
The Microsoft teams VoIP integration seems to generally be the clear winner for small businesses looking for ease of connection with quality for the price.
How To Use VoIP With Microsoft Teams
So, your team has decided that they’d like to put this technology to the test with a Microsoft teams test?
Your mortgage company could benefit from the Microsoft Teams Exploratory license trial.
This free trial that is offered through Microsoft can give a new business or startup a chance to try out the internal communication tools. This gives you temporary access to the powerful features of Microsoft Teams, for a limited time and for a limited number of users.
Then try VoIP out. Connecting to colleagues through Teams could not be easier!
Simple steps to make a call in Teams:
- First, go to your chat list.
- Select “New chat”.
- Add the names of those you’d like included in the “To” field at the top.
- Select “Video” or “Audio” call.
Common concerns:
- How to create a meeting in Microsoft teams: Go to “Teams”, then “Calendar”. Select “New meeting”. Name your meeting. Choose desired date and time. Then, simply add the names of attendees or your team.
- How to record on Microsoft teams: Join the meeting. Go to “meeting controls”. Select “More actions”. Select “start recording”. Everyone will be notified that a recording is starting.
- Changing background in Microsoft teams: Join the meeting. In your pre-join screen, select the “Background filters” or “Background effects” button. From there, add new backgrounds and filters/effects. Then select “Join now”.
- How much does it cost Microsoft cloud VoIP? Most tech choices boil down to costs for a company. The Microsoft 365 Business Voice Plan is affordable, at roughly $20 per user/month (for up to 300 users).
VoIP And Microsoft Teams Is The Perfect Combo
Integrating Teams and VoIP allows a user to utilize all of the wonderful Microsoft applications, while also storing company data in one organized place. Connection and communication will be improved for improving business – in a simple integrated way.
Employees can make and receive calls within Microsoft Teams, while enjoying screen share features, calendar integration, and ease of use.

47,https://etsworks.com/mortgage-firms/scaling-your-lending-firm-with-microsoft-365-cloud-pc/,"As a managed cloud services provider, we intend to share the basic education and benefits of the new Windows 365 enterprise cloud PC. This series is specific to the mortgage and lending industry on how we can leverage the benefits of Microsoft 365 to scale your operation without purchasing expensive computer hardware.
The Challenge
Traditionally firms would recruit a team of 20 loan officers, write a check for $30,000 to purchase computer hardware, and then have an IT team assemble and ship the equipment. If the loan officers leave, the firm has to pay for return shipping labels and has hours of work to retrieve the equipment. Once returned the IT team wipes and rebuilds the computers for another deployment, creating an endless cycle of admin work that cuts into profits and makes scaling that much harder.
The Solution
Thankfully new tools have become available in the Microsoft 365 small business suite, including the new Windows 365 enterprise cloud PC. This solution turns the $30,000 hardware investment into a $700 per month operational expense. When paired with Microsoft 365 apps for enterprise, power tools like AzureAD and Intune allow us to automate the onboarding of new loan officers. Automation strategies can include:
- Automatically installing OneDrive, Teams, Encompass, Adobe, and the Microsoft Office suite.
- Setting the default browser with favorites to commonly used websites.
- Saving training guides on the desktop.
In this model, all the cloud managed services provider needs to support is the loan officers ability to connect to the Cloud PC. And because the IT team can update Microsoft 365 remotely, the loan officer will always have the latest and greatest each time they connect to the Cloud PC.
The Loan Officer’s Experience
- Users goes to a website and logs in with their email and password.
- They are logged into their Cloud PC with up to 3 monitors.
- Once inside the cloud PC they can access all their tools and software.
Final Thoughts On Cloud PCs and Microsoft 365
When you look at the big picture there is no doubt that integrated cloud services like Microsoft 365 is a complete solution for your business. You can even make Microsoft Teams your phone system to further streamline your operation. And don’t forget, reporting services are one of the cloud characteristics that make Microsoft 365 for small business worth it. For example, you can run reports on Cloud PC, email, Teams, and phone call usage. This gives management data to analyze when discussing the right time to hire additional operations staff. It also gives sales leaders tools to identify winning behavior from your top sales associates and easy talking points when loan officers are not hitting their numbers."

Let’s look into the VoIP softphone for business further…
Why VoIP Is Better Than Traditional Phone Services
A company starting out can not overspend on its small business phone system. Luckily, on average, VoIP phone services can cost a firm (large or small) 68 percent less than traditional phone services.
Quality is just as critical as an expense.
VoIP benefits include:

- Portability, flexibility, and scalability: You are able to port your existing phone number between landline, VoIP, and wireless providers. In addition to this, your mortgage company team can travel to any number of locations, just plug in their IP-enabled laptop, and can make and receive telephone calls. This allows your employees to be unlimited and fully connected – helping with scalability.
VoIP is a financially smart choice. It eliminates the very real worries of the costs of long-distance and international calls. Toll-free numbers are also cheaper per minute with a cloud phone system than with a softphone provider.
VoIP serves as a built-in phone answering system for small businesses, allowing for 24/7 connectivity. The primary benefit of VoIP as phones for business offices is connectivity. With a VoIP phone, you can make calls over the internet through VoIP services.

Cyberattacks are on the rise, and cybercriminals continue to leverage increasingly sophisticated techniques to infiltrate systems and steal data. For example, just last year, we saw the fourth largest loan-servicing company in the US, Florida-based Lakeview Loan Servicing, fall victim to a data breach that affected more than 2.5 million consumers[1].
One way mortgage lenders can safeguard their data is with encryption. That’s what we’re going to be diving into here.
Great data security management starts with a team that maps out sensitive information accessed or transmitted within your company. This team should be able to report on a moments notice the latest audit of all files that are considered sensitive, the encryption status of those files, and a report showing which employees have accessed this information. One strategy with Microsoft 365 enterprise licensing is sensitive labels which does exactly that while encrypting the data.
Encryption is a digital form of cryptography that converts data into an unreadable format using mathematical algorithms. This means that if an unauthorized party intercepts the data, it would appear as a scrambled mess, and they wouldn’t be able to extract any meaningful information from it. However, when authorized recipients want to access the data, they can do so with their own key that unscrambles the information back into readable text – this is called decryption.
Data encryption is a vital part of data security in the modern world and is especially important for companies that deal with sensitive customer personal information, like mortgage lenders.
Today, massive amounts of personal information are managed in the cloud or on servers connected to the internet. For example, it’s nearly impossible for mortgage lenders to do any form of business today without customer personal information ending up in a networked computer system. And when dealing with cloud communication, keeping data safe is paramount.
Moreover, successful data breaches cause significant harm to mortgage lenders in the form of costly fines for non-compliance, other financial impacts, and reputational losses. This is the main reason why encryption is important.
Beyond the obvious personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, and social security numbers, mortgage lenders also must meet data security compliance. This data includes customer personal information relating to income, credit score, family member PII, loan or deposit balances, and more.
Mortgage lenders must ensure the security of customer records, protect against anticipated threats to data security, and protect against unauthorized access to information that could harm customers. Encryption plays a key role in data security management.
Companies can deploy encryption at many levels within their infrastructure. For example, data encryption at the database level has some unique advantages, including better integration with other database access controls and encryption key management. This results in fewer security gaps and makes managing data security more straightforward. However, organizations can also encrypt data at the application level, essentially encrypting data before it enters the database. Application level encryption provides a more granular level of control, and many experts consider it the more secure way of protecting data.
Email is a huge part of communication with mortgage applicants, and that is unlikely to change anytime soon. However, email poses some significant security threats. Email can be intercepted in transit, unsecure connections to mail servers are common, and hackers can impersonate legitimate parties with relative ease. One alarming study found that 70% of loan officers allowed applicants to send tax documents and other financial data via unencrypted email attachments[2].
To stop unauthorized access to your computer you must enable BitLocker. BitLocker comes with Microsoft Windows if configured correctly encrypts everything on your computer. Without this feature being configured anyone with physical access to your computer can copy all your data, even if you have a password. That’s because I can plug your hard drive into a $20 device you can buy on Amazon which lets me see all your information. The only way to stop this is if your computer is encrypted.
Encryption isn’t a nice-to-have data security feature but a necessity for mortgage lenders in the digital age. Encrypting your computer systems helps prevent data loss and keeps nefarious actors locked out.
