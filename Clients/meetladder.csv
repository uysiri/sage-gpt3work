Let’s say that you run a small electrical contracting firm, My Electric, LLC and you’re looking at manpower requirements for a single project: a commercial tenant improvement project for a Five Guys Burgers that begins April 13 and is projected to end the week of June 8, about a 2-month project. For simplicity, we will assume that there is a ramp up in the middle of the project schedule to a peak manload of eight electricians, then a ramp down after that, as seen here:
Now let’s assume that you have a steady supply of these projects starting at regular intervals, all with the same manpower requirements. Each project would be ramping down as the other starts to ramp up. In an ideal world, this would result in a constant number of electricians on payroll, in this case, 12 workers at all times (represented by the straight blue line at the top of this graph):
This makes your project managers very happy because you have consistent manpower to assign to projects and there’s never a rush to hire enough hands to be able to staff a project.
But let’s say that your company with an ideal project backlog has just one project start date delayed because of complications with permitting approvals (we’ve all been there). Look how delaying one project by just two weeks changes the blue line representing the company's overall manpower:
Having just one project delayed by two weeks doesn’t sound like a big deal, but look what it does to your company’s manpower requirements. Because of the ideal operating scenario, you have 12 electricians on payroll, but only enough work to support 7 electricians in June. Then in July, you will need 17 electricians to cover all your needs!
And, if you’ve spent any time in construction, you know that projects are never actually distributed this evenly in the first place. Projects have much more complex manload requirements because of the need to do underground work early in the project and come back later to finish rough-in and finishes. Or a project falls through that you were sure would be starting next week. Or a project takes a few more weeks to wrap up than anticipated. So let’s add in a few more variables to the project schedules to more closely resemble real world scenarios.
So now the time that you thought you would be spending building projects that you could be proud to add to your portfolio, you are spending juggling manpower, onboarding new employees, sifting through resumes to fill open positions as quickly as possible, and managing customer expectations and a deteriorating relationship because of schedule delays.
Many contractors who have recognized this problem have chosen to resolve it by partnering with a staffing agency. The benefit of staffing agencies is that they can provide extra hands quickly when you need them most. They can be an effective solution when your needs are for temporary, low-skill labor. But staffing agencies are taking more and more of the construction industry's labor market share because of the time and money that it takes to hire full time employees.
The problem is that staffing agencies provide little or no training to employees, so you should only work with them for a temporary group of helpers who will be able to work under the direct supervision of company journeymen or foremen. And if you're forecasting needing those helpers for more than a couple of months, it makes more financial sense to hire them directly. Plus, all the hours your company employees put into training staffing agency employees are for nothing once they're no longer assigned to your company.
That means the right answer is to hire more employees directly. But between reviewing resumes, scheduling interviews, holding interviews, putting together offers, drug tests, and background checks, the process can be grueling. Then after you finish all of that and the new hire doesn't show up to work on day one, staffing agencies seem very appealing again all of a sudden.
But what if you could put that whole process on auto-pilot? Ladder has created a platform that will automatically find qualified candidates, schedule phone or video interviews, and process all the paperwork for you. That way you can spend less time on job boards and more time building great projects.

As we talked about in our Construction Workforce post, managing your construction workforce can be tricky because of fluctuating project needs, high employee turnover rates, and how long it can take to find quality candidates. That's why, for decades, construction companies have repeatedly turned to staffing agencies to meet their manpower needs. But there are many reasons that you should be hiring workers directly, instead of through a staffing company.
The staffing agency model has been around for decades in the US, but really became popular during WWII and immediately afterwards. One major reason that companies have used staffing agencies throughout time was to fill a large number of positions in a short period of time. So when over 16 million Americans were called to serve in WWII, there were a number of jobs that needed to be backfilled by those not going to war.
Staffing agencies stepped up to the challenge by compiling filing cabinets full of as many open jobs and as many resumes of available workers as they could find. They provided both temporary placement (known as staffing) and direct-hire, full-time placement (known as recruiting). And having companies who were focused full time on replacing employees who went to fight in the war was a huge relief to companies who were suddenly without much of their workforce.
Following the war, there were a number of large, engineering-heavy projects (many of them private-public partnerships) that required hundreds of engineers, such as the Apollo Lunar Module, Boeing 747, and Hubble Space Telescope to name a few. And because of the way that government spending would be approved suddenly or the way federal projects were awarded, these projects often required a quick ramp-up in the workforce to meet a tight deadline.
So again staffing agencies would step in to recruit as many qualified engineers as possible in as short a time as possible. This helped the US government and companies working with the government to develop new military and aerospace technology at speeds unmatched in the rest of the world, all without having to commit to employing these engineers after the projects were completed.
All that makes staffing agencies sound like a great benefit to America's development, which they were. But there were a number of drawbacks as well, and a number of reasons why the model is outdated today.
During those times, engineers were able to make decent money designing for the war effort or for other military and aerospace projects. But their contracts were short-term, often provided little to no job benefits, and caused engineers to live a transient lifestyle away from their families. On top of that, engineers received little to no additional training to progress them in their careers. After all, why would a company spend extra time and money training an employee who won't work there in a few months?
The hardest part came at the end of a contract, when employees would call the staffing agencies who helped to hire them, asking where their next assignment would come from. And if the agency didn't have another position available, those employees would end up back home with gaps in pay, looking for their next opportunity.
So if you're a contract employee who travels more, receives less training, no advancement opportunities, isn't working towards a pension or other savings plan, and has less job security than a ""company man,"" you can see why you would gravitate towards being hired as a full time employee instead. That means staffing agencies over time had access to fewer and fewer candidates who truly met the needs of their clients.
For all of those reasons, we see the same effect today in the construction industry, in which staffing agencies are great for no-experience, temporary needs. But as soon as your needs call for a skilled workforce, you should be looking to hire directly. If you've worked with a staffing agency for skilled positions in the past, you have probably felt this yourself when a worker shows up who doesn't exactly meet your needs.
But we get it. The reasons to turn to a staffing agency for help have existed in construction for far too long. It's difficult to reach quality workers, even harder to evaluate quality through the outdated resume process, and cumbersome and expensive to interview and onboard them once you do find them. We shortcut all that so that you can get the best of both worlds: directly hiring full-time employees significantly faster than you could by just posting to online job boards.
Ladder specializes in filling your workforce needs with high-quality, experienced workers. Think of us as an automated construction recruiter. We provide the benefits that staffing agencies provide, matching your openings to the qualified candidates. The difference is that you provide the company culture, job security, advancement opportunities, and company benefits that employees wouldn't get if working a contract or temp job.

One of the biggest challenges trade contractors experience with hiring and retaining workers is when workers don't communicate why they're leaving the company or declining an offer. Often times, especially during the application process, candidates will simply stop responding after they receive an offer. We asked over 2,000 electricians across 36 states what their pay expectations were, what benefits they most desired in a job, and other questions to better inform employers about the expectations of the electrical workforce. Below is the summary of what we found.
If you're a trade contractor other than electrical, or a general contractor, there are parallels in this data to other trades that you will find useful as well.
We asked electricians across the country how many years of experience they had in the electrical industry and their hourly rate expectations. After removing the outliers and averaging the responses by year, the resulting graph is below.
What we found was that pay expectations in earlier years was pretty consistent, but that they varies much more with more experienced electricians. That is likely for two reasons.
First, abilities and job titles vary much more later in careers than they do earlier in careers. For example, an electrician with 20 years of experience may be foreman, master electrician, or content to be an electrical installer. All three have significantly different job expectations and associated wages, whereas most electricians with fewer than 4 years of experience are typically either apprentices or helpers with relatively little differentiation in job expectations.
The second reason pay rates vary more widely at higher levels of experience is that there's simply fewer electricians with that much experience, which means that differences in pay rates have a larger impact on the overall average.
Following the trendline of expected wages, the largest increase in wage occurs in the earlier years, with the expected wage leveling off in later years. For example, the expected wage between years one and two grows by over 17%. Then the expected wage from years two to three grows by just under 10%. By the time electricians are in their 12th year, the expected wage growth with each year of experience is less than 2% per year. Below is a chart of some selected wages.
We also grouped the responses by job title to get a better understanding of what electrical contractors can expect to pay when hiring for a specific position. The results can be seen in the graph below:
As expected, entry-level positions (helpers, apprentices, and lighting retrofitters) were the lowest earners. Once an electrician moves from the apprentice level to the journeyman level (where they're expected to be pretty self-sufficient), there's almost a 40% increase in wage expectation ($21/hour vs. $29/hour).
One surprising finding was that master electricians expect to earn higher wages than foreman or general foreman, but much less than a superintendent. The dramatic increase in wages between foreman and the superintendent is likely due to the difference in expected project type or size between the two titles. Often times, we have seen foreman or GF running small commercial projects with a dozen electricians or fewer, whereas superintendents may be running large commercial projects with tens or hundreds of electricians onsite.
Pay isn't the only determining factor when it comes to construction workers accepting or declining an offer. We also asked what benefits were most important and the results can be seen below:
Unsurprisingly, the most important benefit to the electricians polled was health insurance, with almost 70% of respondents saying it was important for a company to offer health insurance for them to accept a job. Dental insurance is also relatively important at 56%.
The remaining benefits desired were more surprising. Paid time off (including holiday pay, vacation pay, and sick pay) were all relatively important to the group.
One benefit that we have often seen overlooked by contractors, but which we have heard is important to many workers, is being paid weekly (as opposed to bi-weekly). Close to half of respondents think of weekly pay as important to them in a job. And anecdotally, we have seen a number of candidates turn down job offers because the company pays bi-weekly.
If you're a trade contractor, consider these wage expectations when posting a job opening. If you're posting a wage rage below market value for a certain job title or years of experience, you're likely to get fewer responses or job acceptances. If you're looking to increase your retention of your workforce and don't currently offer health & dental insurance, paid holidays, or weekly pay, look into offering those options to employees. Those benefits can be costly upfront but pay off in the long run by decreasing the number of workers who leave to chase better job offers.
If you're a worker, make sure that you're getting paid your worth! Labor unions obviously negotiate this on behalf of workers, but non-union workers should keep close tabs on their own market value to ensure they're getting a fair deal.
Finally, if you're a general/trade contractor, get in touch if you have questions about the data we've collected or to turbocharge your recruiting. If you're a trade worker, create a profile with us today so that you can receive job updates that you're qualified for to ensure you're getting the pay and benefits you deserve.
