1,https://www.sampoll.co/blog,"Whether you are offering discounted or free samples of one or several products, you will see an increase in sales almost immediately at the beginning of your campaign. You may be thinking, “how will my sales increase, if I am only receiving half or none of the profits?” Sales doesn’t always correlate to money. When it comes to retail sales, the goal is to move your products on and off of retail shelves as swiftly as possible.Read More...
One of the most challenging aspects for marketing consumer packaged goods is building and maintaining customer loyalty. Many CEOs of CPG brands focus their marketing strategies on attracting new consumers, but fail to implement a tactic to keep them. According to SalesCycle, “returning loyal customers spends 67% more than new customers”. Instead of putting most of your marketing dollars in lead generation, you should consider investing in a customer loyalty program.Read More...
Who would have thought? Honestly… Who would have thought how much impact COVID has changed the retail space in 2022? From contactless curbside pickup to groceries delivered onto your doorstep, retailers are making it easier for their consumers to shop using technology. When it comes to retail sampling, consumers aren’t seeing in-store demo products as they have in the past. Since there aren’t many brick and mortar retailers doing store demos anymore, many CPG brands are moving towards using retail sampling technology.Read More...
Almost everyone in the world now owns a cellphone. It’s no surprise that people check their phones up to 160 times a day, or once every 9 minutes, to look at text messages, social media feeds, emails, and more according to Findstack. The question is who would have thought a simple text message could help bring in more sales for your CPG business?Read More...
Did you know that in 2021, “the highest share of consumers in the United States would discover coupons or promos through emails from followed brands or online searches”, according to Statista. Before you jump on the coupon app bandwagon, let’s explore other coupon programs you can use to up your CPG sales.Read More...
The phrase in store promotions is in the CPG brand bible, so if you don’t know it, here is your chance to learn. According to Retailmenot, “promotions spark in-store purchases for 91 percent of shoppers who use in-store promotions.” For most consumer packaged goods brands, in-store marketing is a way of connecting with their customers, while striving to give them the best experience in the retail stores.Read More...
When was the last time you made a purchase without looking at the reviews first? According to Qualtrics, 93% of consumers say online reviews determine their final buying decisions. If your brand is lacking product reviews, how is that affecting your business? For CPG food and beverage brands, it could be tough receiving reviews from your consumers.Read More...
According to a study done by XP2, the Food and Beverage industry has an average shopping cart abandonment rate of over 55%. That means that 1 out of every 2 shoppers that are ready to check out of their shopping cart, suddenly get cold feet and leave your online store without making a purchase that day! What can you do to reduce shopping cart abandonment? You should implement an e-commerce sampling strategy and de-risk the buyer journey for your online store.Read More...
Customer experience for CPG brands is the new battlefield in grocery retail! 86% of consumers are willing to pay more for a great customer experience, according to a study by PwC. There are a million products for consumers to choose from, so how do you plan to stand out against the competitors? It’s simple, you need to invest and implement a shopper marketing strategy for your CPG brand.Read More...
Dr. James Richardson cites in his book, “Ramping up Your Brand”, that “roughly 80 percent of premium food/beverage brands fail to make it past $1 million in retail sales.” It goes without saying that most emerging CPG brands are having a more difficult time with sales velocity than their more established competitors. That may seem like a no brainer, but there are many factors that contribute to this. Lack of awareness, a marketing strategy, and not knowing how to measure their sales velocity in retail stores.Read More...
The stakes are high for the CPG industry, as the potential lost revenue from brand switching is estimated at $1.6 trillion USD, a 29% increase from 2010 according to a study done by Accenture. In addition, Deloitte recently came out with a study that shows brand loyalty in several major product categories has declined over the years. The problem that most CPG brands are facing now is brand awareness and a failure to implement redemption programs into their marketing strategies.Read More...
In-store demos come with inherent obstacles. For example, limited customer reach due to limitations of daily foot traffic per store. Also, a possibility of exposing your product to uninterested audiences which doesn’t equate to more retail sales. Chances are that a good portion of shoppers that walk by your in-store demo may not necessarily fancy your superfood bars or veggie burgers.Read More...
In store sampling has always been the gold standard when it comes to immersive experiences to create awareness and drive initial sales in brick and mortar stores. This type of instore advertising allows potential customers the chance to engage one-on-one with promotional events staff aka brand ambassadors to create more personable and memorable experiences.Read More...
CPG marketers must look beyond using food demonstrators in supermarkets and find new product sampling ideas to reach new shoppers, and drive consumer packaged goods sales. This apparent shift in consumer behavior has produced a few alternative cpg strategies starting to garner interest in the retail CPG market and one is gaining a lot of momentum, the use of contactless product sampling.Read More...

Our virtual brand ambassadors will share local Instant Sampling events that are happening near you! These events typically run for 60-90 days, and in some cases a limited supply so we encourage you to redeem your Instant Samples as soon as possible.Read More...
Consumer shopping behaviors are changing faster than ever before! The global pandemic has pushed consumers onto the internet to get their dopamine rush from online shopping. In fact, over 4 trillion dollars was spent buying goods online in 2020, which is almost 30% more than the year prior.Read More...
We have been hearing about Big Data, data this, and data that for years. But data is nothing more than units of information, most often numeric, that are collected through observation. More technically put, data is either qualitative or quantitative, that measures sets of variables about one or more persons or objects.Read More...
According to e-commerce platform, Shopify, conversational commerce is a term coined by Uber’s Chris Messina in a 2015 piece published on Medium. It refers to the intersection of messaging apps and shopping. There is an increasing trend toward interacting with businesses through messaging and chat apps or through voice technology, like Amazon’s Echo product, which uses voice commands to connect to your favorite companies.Read More...
Picture this - you developed your target list of potential stores and cross out the stores that don’t fit your criteria such as discount grocery outlets since you are selling a premium beverage product. Why should this store carry your CPG product? Did you bring anything other than some print materials?Read More...
If you put yourself in the shoes of a typical shopper it’s all about sight, touch, sound, smell, and taste when evaluating an item for purchase. That’s why retailers like Costco lure customers in with free samples, and stores like Ulta Beauty allow customers to try on certain makeup and fragrance products.Read More..."

9,https://www.sampoll.co/faq,"Sampoll makes it super easy and fun to find and try new/unique/differentiated CPG (consumer packaged goods) products.
We partner with all sorts of amazing brands so you (the consumer) can try their products absolutely risk free! Sometimes we're even able to throw in a little extra $$ or other incentives.
And we don't just send you a little single serve sample size like some of the other guys...we always make sure you're able to redeem a FULL-SIZE product so you have enough to take home and share with friends/family as well (if you want to)!
It's incredibly simple actually. All you need to do is chat with our friendly AI-powered brand concierge ""Sam"" anytime you see the Sampoll logo on an advertisement or product that you want to sample and you'll secure your FULL-SIZE product.
Once you chat with Sam and share a valid email, you'll receive instructions to redeem a rapid rebate. Typically this means you go and buy the product from any convenient retailer near you, and then upload a receipt of your purchase. We'll then reimburse you (often 100% of the value within 72 hours of receipt approval)! We send the money directly to your preferred Paypal or Venmo account. You'll always know the rebate dollar value before you buy the product, and most times we can cover the full cost of the product!
Soon you'll also be able to explore our virtual sample marketplace (coming soon) and earn rewards just for exploring offers!
Sampoll is free to join, and free to use as a consumer! The brands we work with cover the cost so you can always try their products risk-free!
If you're a brand that's interested in pricing please contact us at support@sampoll.co and use subject line ""learn more"".
We work with all sorts of CPG brands, primarily food and beverage at the moment, but we're always expanding!
To give you a sense, we are currently offering samples for (or have offered samples in the past) in the following product categories:
The best part is, you can always chat with Sam to request a new product on the platform anytime!!
Three things you can do:
If you're itching to try a product we don't currently have, just let our digital brand concierge (Sam) know, and we'll work tirelessly to get it for you!
Also - don't forget to share Sampoll with your friends! We'll enter you in a monthly giveaway to win $$ when you do!
We are very serious about protecting your information, and will only share your information (email and responses) with the brands you sample products from if you give us permission.
You will never receive any unsolicited marketing material (emails, promotions, offers, etc) from brands that you have not engaged with, and you can always opt-out of any further communication from brands that you have previously agreed to communicate with.
At Sampoll, we operate with the overarching vision that most consumers are interested in having more natural interactions on the web. Conversational AI technology has come a long way recently and we believe more and more of our interactions online will be conversational over the next several years. The data backs this up too, as nearly 8 out of 10 consumers say they prefer to chat with a conversational assistant over a traditional web form or survey.
As we continue to grow, we see a future where Sam can be accessible to chat with wherever and whenever you'd like via SMS, Google Home, Amazon Echo, web chat, Facebook Messenger, etc. Our goal is to make Sam (our AI powered conversational assistant) as helpful as a highly trained real life brand ambassador and smart enough to anticipate your needs and preferences when it comes to product sampling opportunities!
We pride ourselves on white-glove customer service. If you ever have a problem with our services please don't hesitate to reach-out to support@sampoll.co and we'll get back to you ASAP!
We're backed by the support, networks, and funding of some truly amazing people/companies! We've received early funding from a small but diverse set of investors including Gordon Food Services (the 5th largest food distributor in the U.S.) and Gener8tor (named one of Fast Company's most innovative startup accelerators)."

13,https://www.sampoll.co/post/3-ways-to-boost-retail-performance-shopper-experience,"If you are reading this you must be interested in making some changes to your marketing strategy. Perhaps you've already started implementing and experimenting with new ideas. With the rollercoaster of environmental, social, and psychological factors affecting the world as we know it, there are a few things to consider when looking to captivate your audience, stay relevant, and scale your business in the new norm.
The customer journey is now both in-store and most recently more-so online. Connecting both the in-store and online engagements is imperative to maintaining and scaling customer growth. There is a mountain of data online and in-store that is not being captured or leveraged appropriately.
Our recommendation would be to implement tactics that incentivize online users to convert in store for a reward or discount, and then vice versa targeting and driving your in-store customers online for rewards and discounts thus creating a virtuous cycle. With proper tracking you can now measure engagement throughout the journey.
When was the last time you clicked on a display ad??? Consumers are now doing their due diligence before, during and after purchases. So then what is it that influenced their purchasing decisions? Well most individuals are looking to see what their peers think, rather than putting trust in any “push” advertising.
Our recommendation would be to harness the power of micro influencers and organic brand ambassadors. Just think not only is it more cost effective, it is also more engaging for the end user. Word of mouth marketing is still the most power force in marketing. So build a community, not just a targeted user pool you segment, and Google owns.
Technology is a huge part of all of our lives and our dependence on it continues to grow, especially as new and innovative applications emerge. It influences our behaviors, how we perceive interactions, and experience life. So differentiating your brand or retail establishment from another is critical. The old saying “innovate or die” rings more true now, than ever before. Just think, what makes your store different from the one down the street? What magical moment will your customers remember and share with their friends? A culture of innovation is the solution to help grow and more deeply engage your audience both in-store and online. So get those creative juices flowing.
Our recommendation is to start creating engaging experiences both for your online and in-store audience. Look to technology like interactive displays in stores to boost product sales, impulse buys, and engagement. Deploy voice activated shopping experiences with your online audience by leveraging Amazon Alexa or Google Home.
Transforming your customers' experience both in-store and online is not an easy task, and there is no one size fits all solution. Brands need to be ready to accept change and think differently. We find ourselves at a pivotal point in the market with immense disruption but also significant opportunity. Retailers and brands have to embrace technology especially mar-tech and customer experience tech. The brands that make it through these trying times will be the ones who shook up the game, found ways to improve the shopper experience, increase customer loyalty and build community.
If you are interested in learning more about unique tactics and seeing a real experience boosting solution in action, contact me at drewp@sampoll.co.
Cheers!

Chief Operations Officer, Sampoll"
14,https://www.sampoll.co/post/4-ways-to-maintain-the-customer-lifecycle-with-sampoll,"How well do you actually know your customers? No, really! How well?!
The Sampoll team thought it would be a great opportunity to discuss the importance of getting to know as much as possible about your customers. Customers are the lifeblood of any business and getting personal and really stepping into the “shoes” of your customers is the only way to engage, inspire and connect in a way that is both meaningful and valuable for both parties.
Do you truly know what your customers like? How about what your customers do not like? Can you really say, with confidence, what your ideal customer looks like?
Did you know?
→ 91% of today’s consumers, particularly digital natives, are most likely to shop with brands that provide relevant offers and recommendations.
→ 95% of customers tell others about a bad experience and 87% share good experiences.
→ 52% of marketers adapt their strategies and tactics based on customer interactions and feedback.
Here are 4 ways to maintain the customer lifecycle with Sampoll.
1. Discover highly qualified customers
Whether your brand is hosting in-store product sampling demos or providing free at-home samples to new or existing customers, Sampoll has the right conversational data collection tools to help you and your team clearly differentiate consumers who genuinely like your product and are showing purchasing intent vs. consumers that did not like your product and are not worth your time or advertising dollars. There is a huge time and cost savings by using insights tools like Sampoll that will do all the reporting automatically. Yes, it’s magical and if you are an emerging CPG brand with a limited budget this is a great option without breaking the bank!
2. Elevate your Customer Engagement with Sampoll
Brands today are using Sampoll to run virtual wine tastings, cooking experiences, quizzes, and other fun community activation activities to both engage current customers and attract new customers. Why do brands use Sampoll for this? Not only does Sampoll enable brands to continue a meaningful dialogue throughout the customer journey, but it gives brands an easy way to set up, manage, and execute product sampling experiences all in one place while also collecting actionable first-party customer feedback!
3. Sampoll can help you retain customers
We know that feeling of sheer bliss when you attract new customers to your brand but can you retain your customers? That is the trillion dollar question! Customers switching companies due to poor service costs U.S. companies a total of $1.6 trillion per year. One easy way to retain your customers is to provide relevant product offers and recommendations based on their taste preferences. Sampoll is able to help you capture valuable data on individual customer taste preferences right at the “point-of-sampling” and you can use Sampoll’s retargeting tool to re-engage customers and share personalized offers and recommendations that will truly delight your customers and helps build a real sense of trust and loyalty in your brand.
4. Expand your product line(SKUs) and customer LTV
Gathering accurate customer feedback on your products and services can be valuable when looking to expand your product line, get more SKUs on the shelves and build customer Lifetime Value(LTV). According to Harvard Business Review, marketing products as “customer-ideated” increases market performance by up to 20%. Sampoll helps you show customers you care about their input and makes them feel heard and valued. Customer LTV increases as your brand successfully retains customers and drives brand loyalty.
Sampoll is a great solution to collect valuable input from customers during the product testing process. Let’s say, for example, you are a beverage company looking to expand into the “Flavored Seltzer” category. Sampoll can help you determine what is the winning flavor among new and existing customers by helping you manage an in-store demo or at-home product sampling campaign and then collecting quick customer feedback on specific flavors that you are testing. All at a fraction of the cost of hiring some fancy research firm to conduct a focus group not to mention waiting gruesome 4-6 weeks to get your report. Sampoll’s intelligent reporting and management suite levels the playing field for small and mid-sized CPG brands by getting your reports on customer feedback almost in “real-time” and helps you compete with the larger brands in your category!
A retail buyer’s job is to bring in new SKUs that sell and maximize their shelf real estate sell-through. In order to increase your chances of getting on their shelf, you must convince the buyer that your product will sell well. Instead of wishing on a prayer in hopes that the buyer will go with their gut and take a chance on your brand, you can use Sampoll and provide data and social proof of your product’s ability to fly off the shelf!"
15,https://www.sampoll.co/post/a-new-digital-demo-solution-for-cpg-brands,"Food and Beverage brands are shifting more and more to digital, and relying less and less on physical contact with consumers when it comes to marketing and demonstrating the taste and benefits of their products. CPG marketers must look beyond using food demonstrators in supermarkets and find new product sampling ideas to reach new shoppers, and drive consumer packaged goods sales. This apparent shift in consumer behavior has produced a few alternative cpg strategies starting to garner interest in the retail CPG market and one is gaining a lot of momentum, the use of contactless product sampling.
In 2020, we saw the emergence of “closed sampling” where retailers would leave out pre-packaged samples in a container on the open floor for shoppers to grab at their own convenience as they walked around the grocery store. As grocery curbside pick-up became a more popular and COVID-safe approach to shopping, brands like General Mills have revved up the number of samples that it has paid to place in curbside pickup orders at retailers, including Walmart, Kroger and Target.
In 2021, an even newer approach to product sampling was introduced to the retail market. Retail technology startups like Sampoll saw a way to create a new contactless and staffless solution that can increase product trial and store velocity for CPG brands in retail. What does this consist of? It consists of geo-targeted paid media offers and using AI-enabled branded chatbots that entice potential clients and persuade them to take part, and trial product. These offers are great because consumers can redeem them immediately, thereby producing instant satisfaction!
Digital product sampling programs are awesome because now CPG brands can reap a variety of benefits. For example, by using a contactless method, CPG brands can appeal to consumers that are weary of interacting with in store demo staff at in person product demonstration events.
In addition, CPG food companies will now have access to vital analytical data that can be used to hyper target customers and gain invaluable information about consumer behaviour. This information is paramount to mapping out an accurate customer digital journey and pinpoint new CPG marketing trends.
Moreover, CPG brands can run month-long campaigns digitally, versus in person marketing campaigns that can only run a few times a month. It also allows them to infinitely scale as CPG brands can now engage with consumers anywhere and anytime from a single campaign. This is a tremendous sales opportunity and will increase CPG sales for top CPG brands.
Ecommerce sampling promotions can be run on different platforms. For example, social media sampling campaigns can be utilized to hyper target customers across a vast distance of digital geographies online.
In addition, positive discussion on social media regarding your CPG brand will help build brand loyalty and spread brand awareness.
Digital marketing campaigns will be more widely used due to the rise of new safety precautions and the need for alternative digital solutions that offer increased scale while cutting costs.
Therefore, many businesses such as CPG brands must react accordingly and be apt for contactless product sampling programs versus in person demo events. Results include the acquisition of critical analytical data, and a more efficient use of marketing dollars with real ROI.
Contact a Sampoll rep today to explore new ways of doing retail product sampling for your CPG brand!"
16,https://www.sampoll.co/post/analytical-data-vs-customer-insights-for-brands,"We have been hearing about Big Data, data this, and data that for years. But data is nothing more than units of information, most often numeric, that are collected through observation. More technically put, data is either qualitative or quantitative, that measures sets of variables about one or more persons or objects.
Now that just sounds boring, dry, and technical. What about data sounds even remotely human. We are not computers and we are not programmable robots. So what is it that moves us forward, keeps us engaged, or ushers in the next big trends?
Well that is where insights take flight. Data is not synonyms with insights, but some insights can be gleaned from data. Insights bring the human experience into the world of innovation. Its innovation which has been critical to advancing people’s relationships and experience, with their environment, each other, as well as brands and their products.
A brand and their products only exist if they are based upon one or more measured behaviors that you are either working to support, advance, or change. For instance just think of all the people who flock to dairy free, non GMO, no pesticide, grass fed, meat free, sugar free.... The list goes on and on. But those things did not exist from data alone, because insights are built upon human needs and preferences, which leads to ideas that create value in people's lives.
The best insights are gained from watching how customers interact with products in everyday life, listening to their true unbiased feedback, and learning from those behaviors and enacting change aka innovation. The best innovation solves a common problem, provides a more efficient way of doing something, or brings simplicity and unity to an unspoken gap in a process or interaction. Simply put, “the future does not fit in the containers of the past” - Rishad Tobaccowala
Consumer insights provide a business with the opportunity to better personalize and tailor products to the needs, wants, and demands of their customers. Building trust, loyalty, and ultimately selling more products, or discontinuing underperforming ones.
For example: An online seller ELOQUII used customer insight and retail analytics to uncover a new market. ELOQUII discovered this market by uncovering a trend in product returns. Finding that customers were ordering multiple white dresses and returning some of their order. Using this data, ELOQUII found that consumers were actually shopping for wedding dresses. It was then that a matrimonial audience and marketing segment was born for them. Their marketing team leveraged this information and started actively targeting promotions and ads to this new demographic.
Insights tell a story and people love stories. Stories invoke emotions, and emotions are powerful in decision making. Its insights that give understanding of the why, and build the emotional connection with consumers and brands."

With thousands currently in the market, you may want your CPG brand to be part of it. But who said apps are the best or most efficient for your consumers?
Did you know that in 2021, “the highest share of consumers in the United States would discover coupons or promos through emails from followed brands or online searches”, according to Statista. Before you jump on the coupon app bandwagon, let’s explore other coupon programs you can use to up your CPG sales.
Remember back in ""the day"" when you would see coupon dispensers in grocery stores? Yeah, those were the good times, and we remember pulling the coupons in every aisle that had one. But now, times are even better, because everything is moving into the digital world. Your consumers are no longer clipping coupons from the newspaper anymore. They can simply get coupons all from their phones, either from your website, your loyalty program, apps, or email marketing. For more ideas, learn about in-store promotion strategies here.
If you want to dive into CPG digital coupon programs, here is the best place to start. To see which method is best for your business, we’ll explore the options of each, based on your consumer’s behavior.
Your existing customers are likely part of your loyalty program. They are already familiar with your brand and your products, you just want to keep them loyal by constantly showing them your appreciation. And by doing so, you offer them coupons that will be useful to them.
These coupons could be as generic or specific as you please. Generic coupons could be exclusive deals that only email subscribers can get, like, “Here’s $5 off your next purchase”, or “This weekend only, buy 1, get 1 free.” Specific coupons could be tailored to the consumer’s past purchase history. Other examples can be flash sale coupons, newsletter coupons, and free product launch coupons.
If your CPG brand has its own app, you are golden. Many consumers are constantly looking for legit brand apps that are user friendly, easy to shop, and easy to find coupons for online or in-store use. This gives your existing customers an exclusive, personalized feel that makes them feel valued. Other than email coupons, this is another way to offer coupons to your customers.
When thinking of a way to gain more consumers in the digital world, you will have to get a little creative. No more paying for coupons to be printed in newspapers or any other paper form of advertising. Here are some ways to get new customers using a digital coupon marketing tactic.
Between Google and social media, you can go far when creating ads to offer your coupons. The great thing about digital ads is that you can target your ideal consumers based on their habits and search queries. You can target their age, location, and things they may have searched online to help you reach your target audience. As an added factor, your ad on social media can be shared and saved. But if done wrong, it can be a complete flop.
This only works if a consumer has heard of you, but hasn’t tried your products yet. Other than your existing customers, creating a blast coupon on your website can help turn a curious customer into a buying customer. Now-a-days, all you need is a QR code that will provide consumers your coupon to show to retail cashiers, and that’s it. And as we all know, if they like it, they will return.
Since we are already on the proverbial “coupon train”, here is what Sampoll has to offer. The retail tech company will partner with you to gain active high value customers using their Rapid Rebate™ technology that gets you cash back within 1-3 days via venmo or paypal at any participating retailer in North America.
This is a fundamental difference from your typical coupon offer because Rapid Rebates are attracting shoppers that are interested enough in trying your product to physically go to the store, and pay for the product with their own money. Coupons if not monitored correctly can attract “freebie seekers” and “extreme couponers” that may not be genuinely interested in buying your product after the initial trial.
First-Party Opt-in Customer Data. This is not something you will receive with a typical coupon program. Sampoll prides itself on generating opt-in e-mails and store-level receipt data from each shopper that redeems a Sampoll brand offer! It goes beyond the free offer to drive a memorable trial experience for the shopper that engages with “Sam,” Sampoll’s AI-enable chat ambassador. Sam helps educate shoppers on your product offering through 1:1 conversational experiences. If only coupons had a face and could talk. Sampoll brings “personality and life” to free offers that were never possible with a static paper coupon!
So when choosing between coupons vs rapid rebates, why not A/B test Sampoll rapid rebates against your current couponing campaigns and see which approach works best to attract lifetime buyers and actionable shopper insights!

18,https://www.sampoll.co/post/cpg-grocery-brands-we-have-a-first-party-data-problem,"You just launched a new plant-based food product in the market. You are eager to get your new product SKU stocked on the shelves at retailers across the country but then you realize one thing...It’s SO MUCH HARDER than you originally thought. You have a tough time convincing major retailers that your product is worth a look because you don’t have sufficient evidence to back up your claims. It seems like the only way to convince retail (Big-Box) buyers is using the old “pay-to-play” method which significantly hurts your bottom line.
Over the past century(Pre-COVID), our industry (CPG) seemed to be one of the “unlucky” industries that relied heavily on retailers to sell goods and unfortunately it came with a lack of useful customer data that you may need to survive and thrive among the sea of competition in this day and age.
Virtual space is much easier to come by than physical retail space. However, whether you choose Big Box retail as your channel of distribution or online retail like Amazon - both are MAJOR hoarders of first party data.
The problem this poses for emerging brands (especially) is first party data means everything to early stage brands. This is the data that can inform key product decisions that help your business not only survive but thrive!
Additionally, first party data can help prove brand growth and success which only helps with category expansion - something every brand strives for in gaining more shelf space.
Amazon owns nearly 50% of all e-commerce in the United States. Amazon has such a stronghold in the market that most consumers continue to spend a majority of their shopping time. This leaves CPG brands with little to no choice but to sell on Amazon in order to maximize their online customer reach.
To answer the original question, No - Amazon is not your friend when it comes to first-party data. They too have a key competitive advantage which is being the masters of collecting and interpreting mountains of first-party consumer data. This data is how they deliver hyper-targeted marketing and offer personalized product recommendations. (In fact, in Jebbit’s research on trust and consumer data, consumers ranked Amazon as the most trusted company, suggesting that it’s not how much information companies collect but how they use it to benefit the consumer that cultivates consumer trust).
Amazon has also taken over the grocery industry with their recent Whole Foods acquisition and are doubling down on their private label brands. Their competitive advantage of first-party data can certainly be a big disadvantage for you as a brand and without that data you can’t create elevated personalized shopper experiences for your customers like Amazon can.
Sampling campaigns can generate mountains of first-party data, and is an often overlooked tactic when marketers think about brand activation strategy.
This is a simple work around where your brand has the opportunity to interact directly with customers and collect as many data points as you can. By creating experiences that are meant to elicit volunteered information—or declared data—marketers can seek the exact insights they need instead of proxies for that information.
What might this look like in practice? The martech startup, Sampoll is currently helping CPG brands with both their in-store and online customer data collection.
How to collect first party data In-Store with Sampoll
You can collect valuable first-party data with Sampoll’s Staff/Ambassador reporting application for in-store demos. This mobile tool makes it easy for your in-store demo staff to easily input customer feedback on your product and collect other pertinent information “in the field” like opt-in emails from customers so you can follow up with personalized offers/recommendations based on what product they tasted at your demo! Sampoll’s intelligent reporting dashboard automatically shows actionable customer data to you in near “real-time”.
Sampoll XM offers custom-tailored “customer activation” experiences such as branded pulse polls, virtual wine tastings, cooking experiences and guided meditations so CPG brands can seamlessly gauge consumer interest in your brand and the products you are offering.
Sampoll XM offers templatized digital quiz-like experiences that are fun and can lead consumers to personalized product recommendations based on their lifestyle and preferences. Even Sampoll’s Conversational Bot Experiences can become one of the most engaging experiences for consumers with a proper branded facelift and an attractive user interface. The possibilities on Sampoll XM are vast and will help gather customer insights CPG marketers only dreamed of before tools like Sampoll existed!
Retailers may own the customer experience at the point of sale, but that doesn’t have to block CPG brands from forging relationships with consumers directly. It’s time to turn to “declared data” to power your customer journey!"
19,https://www.sampoll.co/post/customer-loyalty-with-cpg-brands,"One of the most challenging aspects for marketing consumer packaged goods is building and maintaining customer loyalty. Many CEOs of CPG brands focus their marketing strategies on attracting new consumers, but fail to implement a tactic to keep them. According to SalesCycle, “returning loyal customers spends 67% more than new customers”. Instead of putting most of your marketing dollars in lead generation, you should consider investing in a customer loyalty program.
Customer loyalty is building and maintaining a positive, interactive relationship between your brand and your customers. Coming up with marketing strategies to build brand awareness is the first step to attracting your target consumers. Attracting shoppers is fantastic but now what? You still have to make it worth their while to stick around. Shoppers want your online presence to be positively interactive, entertaining, and consistent. They want their shopping experience to feel painless and easy. The key word here is consistency. You can build trust with your customers with consistency over time!
Just like building a relationship in a budding romance, your person of interest wants you to be consistent in your actions, your words, and they want to be heard. The same goes for maintaining a loyal customer base. To apply this concept into an effective marketing strategy, you can create a CPG loyalty program.
The first step in building a customer loyalty program is to know your target customer. If you haven’t already, create a buyer persona of your ideal customer and imagine what their lifestyle is like. What do they do for a living? Where do they live? Age range? Hobbies? What social media platforms are they into? Also, think about how your CPG products can solve any challenges they may face in their daily lives, and cater your marketing towards that.
Next, look into your database to see which products your current customers value the most. You should check into your retailers, website entries, social media analytics, and any third party data collection to see the demographic insight of your customers and which products they like the most.
Once you have the data in hand or in sight, you can create a loyalty program that will be valuable to your ideal customers. When it comes to CPG marketing, you have to be creative and innovative to effectively stand out from other brands. No longer should you only rely on in-store marketing, you need to move into the online digital space to connect with more customers all over the world.
For an effective CPG experience, your brand messaging and product packaging marketing should be consistent. This is where product psychology comes into play. Since people associate things with experiences and emotions, you will want to ensure your consumers are viewing your product the way you intended. Creating your brand, product, and online presence should all have a strong identity that customers can relate to.
The main focus is to create an image in your customers’ mind using words and visual cues that will resonate with them. This is effective with display ads, television ads, and, believe it or not, social media. To build a relationship with a customer, you will have to put your brand and products out there by introducing yourself and showing them how your product works.
Catch their attention with colors, images, shapes, and show them all the benefits they will receive if they buy your products. In your video content, narrate a story that will resonate with them. Give them plenty of reasons why your product beats out the competition. The key is to give your new and existing consumers the opportunity to think about your brand before and after they make a purchase.
Speaking of social media, you can create visuals for people to interact with. One way to build customer loyalty is to get and keep your customers involved with your brand. Give them a reason to like, follow, and share your content with their friends and followers online. This method will keep you subconsciously in the forefront of their minds. The next time they see your brand in retail stores, they will remember the positive experience they had with your social media account and make a purchase.
The most popular types of CPG loyalty programs are the point systems rewards and tier rewards. There are many other loyalty programs out there, but for consumer packaged good marketing, these two are the most favored by consumers. Both types allow customers to easily sign up online or in-store, and offer valuable promotions and incentives to keep current consumers buying more. Not only will this increase sales, you will also create a long-term relationship with each customer.
Consumers love these loyalty programs because it builds excitement. You reward them for being loyal, and it gives them a valuable reward to use. A certain amount of points can redeem digital coupons and free products.
If you are a CPG brand in the food and beverage industry, one way to use these programs is to allow customers to upload their receipt onto your website or app, using their membership login credentials.
This loyalty program rewards customers points based on certain behaviors and transactions. After signing up for the program, you can give your customers points for every dollar spent, or a certain amount of points for each product. Or you can get creative and allow points for subscribing to email newsletters, referring other customers to download your app, free points for their birthday, etc.
This customer loyalty program is similar to the point system, but uses a different method. Tier rewards offer incentives based on their spending levels. Each level unlocks a different benefit or coupon for the customer. For example, for every $20 spent in a month, the customer receives a $5 off coupon. For every $50 spent in a month, the customer receives a $15 off coupon. Or for every $100 spent in a month, the customer receives an exclusive free sample or full sized product.
You can get as creative as you want with loyalty programs. But when building one, make sure your ideas meet the needs and wants of your consumers.
Sampoll helps your CPG brand with customer loyalty and retention by offering an unique loyalty program with cashback rebate product sampling and exclusive offers! They help reach new and existing consumers using a multi-channel hyper targeted approach, which attracts high intent local shoppers to get to know and try your products.

20,https://www.sampoll.co/post/dear-cpg-brands-and-agencies-stop-using-google-forms-for-in-store-demo-recaps,"Dear CPG brands and agencies,
I regret to inform you that your Google Forms are making your life harder(not easier) when it comes to managing and reporting on in-store demo product sampling campaigns (and that doesn’t get any better as you transition to digital sampling).
The Sampoll team interviewed over 170 CPG brands and promotional event staffing agencies and roughly 50% of them said they currently use Google Forms for reporting on in-store or in-person product sampling demos.
What is Google Forms?
It’s one of the many wonderful free tools courtesy of Google that anyone can use to make online surveys. This is a great option if you are looking to make standard surveys, quizzes or event registration forms without spending money.
Here are some disadvantages for your brand ambassadors and promotional staff:
a) Google forms is an online, internet based tool. If you’ve ever been to a large trade show, internet access and bandwidth can be very spotty. Thus, trying to collect real-time information to send to remote teams renders itself impossible and probably why you’re tirelessly chasing down your staff for demo recaps after the events.
a) You are flying blind on whether your staff is actually at the event! Google forms are simple - they just allow you to fill out some basic multiple choice questions - and that’s it. There are no additional features in Google Forms that allow you to create transparency to hold your staff accountable.
a) There are no photo gallery features to easily upload and store those booth setup/customer activation photos that you or your brand customers may have requested. There is no way to automatically compile and format these photos for reporting.
b) If you want to make custom reports, you will have to use google sheets(excel format) raw data and create your own manual reports that can result in eating up a lot of your time!
Switching from Google forms to Sampoll:
Sampoll is a platform to help brand activation managers and agencies oversee sampling campaigns all in one, easy to use, platform.
a) Your demo staff can easily check-in/out of their shift for the event using our GPS tracker and helps you keep tabs on all your staff in real time. Sampoll now has a unique feature, multi-location tracking technology for those guerilla marketing street campaigns when your staff walks around to different stops during one campaign.
a) Event Photo Gallery - Sampoll has a robust photo gallery section so you can take multiple photos of your events and Sampoll will automatically add them to your report.
b) Intelligent Dynamic Reporting - No more chasing down your reps to ask for their post-demo recaps, Sampoll automatically collects and packages your recaps in a visually appealing dynamically generated report that can be exported or shared with your brand customers in real time."
21,https://www.sampoll.co/post/fall-in-love-with-live-shopping-events,"If you put yourself in the shoes of a typical shopper it’s all about sight, touch, sound, smell, and taste when evaluating an item for purchase. That’s why retailers like Costco lure customers in with free samples, and stores like Ulta Beauty allow customers to try on certain makeup and fragrance products.
Fast forward to COVID-19 and now retailers are struggling to replicate the immersive sensory experience of shopping with their online stores. Yes, it’s very convenient to click a button on Amazon and have a product delivered right to your doorstep, but what about engagement? Will digital commerce ever be able to provide the same experience as shopping in brick-and-mortar?
Some of today’s most innovative brands in the Asian market are attempting to bring consumers one step closer to the in-person experience. As of March, 2020 there were 560 million people watching shopping live-streams in China, an increase of 126 million compared to last June, according to a report published by the China Internet Network Information Center. Almost half of them used live-streaming for online shopping, according to the report. South Korea and China are growing faster than any other country in the Asian live-stream market but what about Live commerce in the USA?
Despite the American market lagging behind the Asian market, Amazon launched Amazon Live in 2019. For all of you HSN fans it comes with all those flashy icons fluttering on the screen each time a purchase is made!
Live streaming has become a viable platform for digital consumers to interact, contribute, and purchase. By delivering interactive video experiences, today’s organizations are able to connect with viewers in a way that closely resembles the sensory brick and mortar experience.
If you want to reduce customer latency for your brand you should seriously consider adding Live Shopping Events to your marketing mix! Sampoll is currently experimenting with Live at-home product sampling events to help bring a similar sensory experience for your digital sampling strategy."
22,https://www.sampoll.co/post/for-the-love-of-cpg-brands,"Do you feel the love? Probably not. Why? There are thousands of new products that enter the market each year, which only fuels the over-saturation and increases the competition for you, the brand, to compete for consumer attention.
Coupled with recent shifts in consumer behavior, and fragmented D2C buying platforms (like Shopify vs. Amazon), trying to capture the hearts and retain the love of your target customer is harder than ever before.
Choice overload, otherwise known as analysis paralysis, is the result when consumers are faced with too many choices and thus shut down, and make no decisions. The question we’re looking to answer - is how can we prevent analysis paralysis from occurring? The answer: give consumers a way to sample your products!
Here is one way CPG brands can leverage sampling to de-risk the choice overload, capture consumers' attention, and ultimately their hearts.
Beyond the Sample
Sampling helps with top-of-funnel acquisition, however, the Sampoll platform helps CPG brands go beyond the sample to start a conversation with a customer. In the Sampoll platform you can leverage our conversational bot, SAM to collect valuable first-party data alongside your pre-purchase engagement campaigns. The value this brings is moving the model from a “one and done” interaction to a multi-dimensional engagement.
Contact us today at Sam@sampoll.co to learn more about how Sampoll can help your brand go beyond the sample to form long-lasting customer relationships."
23,https://www.sampoll.co/post/how-conversational-commerce-can-boost-product-trial-and-customer-retention-for-cpg-brands,"According to e-commerce platform, Shopify, conversational commerce is a term coined by Uber’s Chris Messina in a 2015 piece published on Medium. It refers to the intersection of messaging apps and shopping. There is an increasing trend toward interacting with businesses through messaging and chat apps or through voice technology, like Amazon’s Echo product, which uses voice commands to connect to your favorite companies.
Did you know that Americans spend 5.4 hours a day using their smartphones? People check their phones 58 times a day on average with more than half of those occurring during working hours.
If you’re like me you’ve probably visited a company’s website recently that offered you the chance to interact with their chatbot. According to a recent State of Marketing report by Hubspot, more than 45% of businesses today have implemented bots as part of their marketing efforts.
COVID has certainly accelerated the shift for CPG brands to set up online storefronts. CPG brands are now struggling with delivering a curated shopper experience that people thought could only exist via face to face engagement. The question is what can brands do to mimic the in-store experience and drive product trial when most states in the U.S. are banning food/bev tastings or product demos in-store?
The answer? Use chatbot experiences to create personal relationships at scale through digital product sampling activations. One vehicle to get products into the hands of consumers in the comfort of their own homes is to create a sample box offering or join an existing sample box program.
A chatbot can act as a virtual brand ambassador that can have 1:1 conversations with customers to collect individual preference data and suggest relevant products in your line that they should try!
For instance, a chatbot for a new potato chip brand called XYZ might suggest the bbq chips be added to the sample box instead of the sour cream chips since your customer specifically indicated they like bbq chips but dislike sour cream chips during a conversation with the bot. Once the sample box has been delivered, your chat bot can re-target that customer and send them a 25% discount via SMS text to purchase the bbq chips at a nearby store or right from your website.
It’s that 5 letter word that every CPG company dreads in the industry...CHURN. According to Progressive Grocer, the average American consumer is a member of 30 reward programs. However, 54% of their members are NOT ACTIVE!
One grave mistake where a lot of CPG loyalty programs fall short is bombarding their loyalty members with irrelevant marketing messages. Nothing can irk a customer more than getting spammed with off putting messages from a brand you thought you could trust.
Chatbots to the rescue! Intelligent chatbot assistants are able to understand your customers better through 1:1 conversations and keep a profile of each customer, with data such as age and preferences; and then share relevant content, tips, how-to video demos, make the experience more “humanized” through GIFs and emojis, and provide relevant recommendations to enhance the customer journey at every touchpoint.
Automate your customer retention and put it in the hands of the almighty chatbots that can get the job done and maintain long lasting customer relationships while providing a consistent and high level brand experience for every single customer. Whether you have 100 customers or 1,000,000 customers, your chatbot will provide a consistent brand experience far better than any human and in a fraction of the time.
If you are a CPG brand looking to elevate your product trial and customer retention you should consider adding a conversational commerce strategy."

Customer experience for CPG brands is the new battlefield in grocery retail! In fact, most CPG brands are breaking away from trade marketing and moving into shopper marketing to give their consumers the best experience possible.
With that being said, 86% of consumers are willing to pay more for a great customer experience, according to a study by PwC. There are a million products for consumers to choose from, so how do you plan to stand out against the competitors? It’s simple, you need to invest and implement a shopper marketing strategy for your CPG brand.
Within this article, we are going to discuss different ways to build a shopper marketing strategy.
In store shopper marketing is a variety of marketing tactics to help engage consumers through their path to purchase journey in the retail store. It’s the overall experience a consumer has in a store while shopping for your product. To ensure that their experience is a great one, you must get personal with them.
Consumers are more likely to purchase from a brand that they connect with on a personal, emotional, or spiritual level. And in order to do this, you and your consumers must get well acquainted.
As a CPG brand, it is important to think about the retailer’s store when creating a distributor strategy. You want to make sure that the store has a positive effect on the consumer. That plays a big part in the shopper’s experience. Not only will this help build your brand, it will also increase your sales velocity. Read more about sales velocity and why you should measure it here, “What is Sales Velocity in CPG?”
Here are some in store shopper marketing strategies to consider.
The ambiance of a retail store can make or break your sales velocity. When walking into a store, consumers want to feel safe, welcomed, and invited. Are the employees friendly? Is the store’s lights well lit? What kind of music do they play? Take all of this in consideration in choosing your retailers.
Having a display next to your product is a sure way to grab your consumer’s attention. It could be a promotional display, or a discount display that’s a shelf talker or an end cap. Some brands even use floor displays that are placed next to your product. This is great for the awareness stage in their path to purchase journey. Samples
Who doesn’t love free samples? This method is a great way to introduce your product to new consumers. Now that we are in a post COVID world and everything is now digital, retail solutions like Sampoll, helps connect consumers to CPG brands by offering product trials with a cashback reward. This way, consumers will have a chance to try your product, before making the commitment of a purchase.
Consumers want the royal treatment while shopping in retail stores. If you partner with a retailer that implements a loyalty program, your brand will have a higher conversion rate than at a retailer who doesn’t. Most retailers offer cashback incentives, points per purchase, or additional coupons to help encourage consumers to buy certain items.
Speaking of coupons, this is another way to set your brand apart from others. Consumers are more likely to purchase your brand over the competition just because you offered a coupon. This way, the consumer feels like they purchased a good deal that also fits their budget.
Building your brand with a purpose to contribute to the consumer’s quality of life is essential. Not only do they want to feel connected with your brand, they also want your products to make their day-to-day lives easier.
Your brand build will help raise awareness, while letting consumers get to know you. They want to know if they can trust you and if your products will be beneficial to them. They may have heard of your brand through Google or social media channels, but they haven’t personally interacted with you.
So when they are in the store and come across your product, they will remember how they initially felt when they saw your ad. Using an in store shopper marketing tactic will help seal the deal when considering a purchase. This is also considered experiential marketing.
Experiential marketing is a marketing strategy that fully engages with the consumer and gives them an unique and memorable experience. Building personalized engagement will create a positive and strong connection between the consumer and your brand.
Sampoll can help with your in-store shopper marketing efforts by eliminating in-store demos, yet providing product sampling through cashback rewards. Our AI-powered chat ambassador, “Sam”, mimics your CPG brand’s tone of voice, and sense of humor to communicate with your consumers, while educating them on your products.
And if they are interested to try, “Sam” will send them a cashback reward for sampling your product. Not only will it increase your sales velocity, your brand will gain new loyal consumers.
This is a great experiential marketing strategy to implement, especially since COVID is stopping the majority of in-store demos from happening in major retailers across North America.
A typical path to purchase journey takes the consumer from awareness (seeing your product), to consideration (comparing your product amongst other options), to conversion (purchasing your product). Each consumer’s path could vary, so it is important to make each stage as engaging as possible to them.
The consumer walks in a store, and the ambiance is great. They have a want or need, and are looking for a product that will satisfy their problem. They are in the right aisle, but they see many products on the shelf. There is your product and from here, many things could happen.
Either they have no idea about your brand nor what your product can do for them, or maybe they’ve seen it before but haven’t tried it yet. Displays and samples can help during this stage to bring awareness to your brand.
They are looking at your product against the others and are now weighing out their options. Is your product on sale? Do they have a coupon for your product? Will they receive loyalty points if they purchase your product? Even if they have little to no awareness of your product, having an incentive will convince the consumer to purchase.
After evaluating their options, they have decided the best product to satisfy their wants and needs. Hopefully, it’s your product that they will have in their shopping cart.

25,https://www.sampoll.co/post/how-sampling-programs-can-help-new-brands-build-demand-and-secure-more-retail-accounts,"Picture this - you developed your target list of potential stores and cross out the stores that don’t fit your criteria such as discount grocery outlets since you are selling a premium beverage product. Why should this store carry your CPG product? Did you bring anything other than some print materials?
Did you bring sufficient enough data that customers in this specific area will in fact buy your product on a repeat basis? According to a Nielsen statistic, only 15% of new CPG products will be successful.
Retail helps brands quickly scale by lowering acquisition costs through high-volume orders. However, retailers also don’t want to take on the risk without the proof that you can drive demand. Sampling is the intermediary that helps bridge the gap.
Conduct Market Research through Product Sampling
Since in-store tastings are halted for the time being one way to see how well your product will do is to run a few digital at-home product sampling campaigns targeting a specific geography you want to sell your products in retail.
Try to run this campaign for several months and see what type of customers are requesting your products and purchasing your products afterwards to gather a significant amount of customer data points.
One way to gather this data without sucking up a lot of time in the early stages of your company is to use Product Sampling management software like Sampoll XM that will not only track your product sampling inventory levels but it will also trigger an automated conversational feedback bot named SAM that will ask questions like “Hey customer X - what grocery stores do you usually frequent?”
Valuable information like this helps when you present your product to target grocers, especially if they see you are selling something their customers really like and are willing to buy!
Let Customers Advocate for You in the Stores
We know you are only a team of two or three but one way to expand your sales geography with limited bandwidth is to set up a brand ambassador program with your most adoring customers that purchased your product after requesting a product sample.

If you are looking for a way to increase sales, gain new consumers, and increase customer value, running a CPG product trial campaign is one marketing technique to implement. You know that all consumers love receiving a great deal, so offering discounted or free products is bound to create positive revenue gains. But once you run the product trial campaign for a certain amount of time, how will you know if it is successful? Here are some indicators of a successful CPG product trial.
Whether you are offering discounted or free samples of one or several products, you will see an increase in sales almost immediately at the beginning of your campaign. You may be thinking, “how will my sales increase, if I am only receiving half or none of the profits?” Sales doesn’t always correlate to money. When it comes to retail sales, the goal is to move your products on and off of retail shelves as swiftly as possible.
This will increase your sales velocity, meaning the more product is being purchased by consumers on a weekly basis, the more retailers are going to make more shelf room in their stores. Of course, when your campaign ends, you will see a decrease in total sales over the next few weeks. However, your baseline sales should increase.
When it comes to CPG brands, keeping up with your baseline sales data will show you how successful one product compares to another. Baseline sales are the number of products sold, without a promotion. So when your campaign ends on a certain product, if successful, you will see an increase in actual sales and revenue.
This means that the consumers who bought your product during your product trial campaign loved it so much that they came back to purchase it again. You will not only see your baseline sales increase, you will also gain new consumers who are referring your products to their family and friends.
Product trials are one of the best ways to attract new customers, who will most likely refer your awesome CPG product to friends and family. When it comes to building an established brand and increasing sales, new customers are the heroes to thank. In the beginning of your business, new customers are your unofficial brand ambassadors, sales agents, and word-of-mouth personnel who influence others to buy your products. Once consumers return to buy more and more of your products, they turn into loyal customers who are constantly spreading the good word about your products to anyone they feel will benefit from them. The best part about referred customers is that it is not always a family member or friend of your loyal customer. It can be a Facebook friend, Instagram follower, or even a shopper standing in the same aisle as your customer.
Speaking of customers, we already talked about how it pays to gain new customers. But we haven’t covered the overall cost of obtaining them. So instead of measuring your customer lifetime value, you should measure every 3-6 months to get a realistic number. Here, we are going to use customer acquisition cost to measure 3 months of customer value.
Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is the amount of money it costs to obtain new customers. This gives you a numeric breakdown of your return of investment (ROI), seeing the difference of how much you spend versus the amount you receive in return. Ideally, you total the amount of your marketing ads and campaigns and divide it by the number of new customers you obtained within 3-6 months.
If you are a “show me what you are talking about person,” here is a formula that will help:
CAC = Blended New Customer Acquisition Cost
$ Total Ad Spend / # New Customers
3 Month Customer Value = 3 Month CV
(3 months after first purchase, what is a customer worth on average)
Now, why do we use these metrics as our guiding targets? Because it reflects if your product trial campaign is successful or not. If your ROI is higher, then your campaign was a success. But what if you find yourself spending more than what you received? Then that means you have an increase in CAC, and that can potentially harm your marketing budget. In fact, according to Business Wire, 66% of DTC companies and 54% of traditional retailers say increasing customer acquisition costs is their top challenge to accomplishing their 2022 scaling goals.
In order to scale and revamp your future campaigns, we need to know two things: What is a customer worth to us? And how much does it cost to acquire that customer?""
Sampoll recently announced a new customer loyalty program that encourages repeat purchases and higher customer value (CV), known as the “Receipt Upload Challenge”. This new program helps answer the following 2 questions during your campaign: “What are my consumers worth to me?” and “How much does it cost to acquire that customer?” New pilot partners in early Q1 of 2023 are expected to benefit from the new “Repeat Purchase” feature, and it comes complimentary for 60-90 days after the initial pilot campaign has lapsed!
Sampoll uses AI-powered chatbot “Sam” to collect real-time data and feedback from new customers, while educating them about your products. So instead of wasting your marketing dollars on obtaining any customer, Sampoll will use our multi-channels to target your ideal consumer, who will likely buy or try your product. In doing so, this program will help scale and optimize your CAC by lowering your overall digital marketing campaign cost.

The phrase in store promotions is in the CPG brand bible, so if you don’t know it, here is your chance to learn. According to Retailmenot, “promotions spark in-store purchases for 91 percent of shoppers who use in-store promotions.” For most consumer packaged goods brands, in-store marketing is a way of connecting with their customers, while striving to give them the best experience in the retail stores.
This is important, because not only does it help build brand recognition, it increases your sales velocity. Now that we are post COVID, people are back to shopping in retail stores to buy their groceries and toiletries. Even though we're in a time where food and beverage costs are rising due to supply chain concerns and inflation, this is a vital time to implement in-store promotions to make it worthwhile.
CPG marketing is a marketing strategy to get your products in the hands of consumers to buy. But how does that apply in stores? There are many ways to implement a good in-store CPG marketing strategy to boost sales and move products off and back on the shelves. One strategy that works well in retail is display signs.
Putting colorful, on-brand display signs right next to your product is a great way to get the consumer’s attention. Whether they know about your product or not, this is a way to lightly educate them about your product, just enough to get them interested in buying. Not only will this potentially help your sales velocity, it will increase your brand awareness. For more information on how to build your brand through in-store promotions, read How CPG Brands can Brand Build with Shopper Marketing.
Another in-store advertising strategy to use is consumer incentives. We all know that people love it when they feel they’ve gotten something free. So why not make it an official win-win? The most popular consumer incentives are loyalty programs, coupons, and samples. And when they are all in digital form on an app, that makes it easy for the ever-growing tech savvy consumers to participate in the incentive.
Loyalty programs are great, because it makes the consumer feel appreciated for buying your products. If your brand is good, your customers will not mind spending the money for quality and loyalty. This makes them feel valued, and in return, it builds a digital relationship between you and your consumers. The more they buy, the more you will reward them. One way to do that is by coupons.
Who doesn’t love a good coupon? Many consumers shop with coupons because they love the feeling of buying something for almost free. And the more coupons you offer, the more they will continue to buy your brand. This is one of the best ways to win customers over when you have recently launched a new product or are expanding into new retail accounts.
Think about it, a customer is shopping for toilet paper and has two options in front of them. Brand A is a brand they’ve used before and loved. Brand B, which is your brand, is something they have never used. Both brands are the same price, same quality, only, you offer a $2 off coupon. The customer will likely give your brand a try, only because they feel as if they got a great deal.
Saving the best for last, samples are the greatest in store promotion there is. Samples are great because they are free. Remember when we said customers love the feeling of getting something for free? Well, this is it. This gives them the opportunity to try your product before they buy. And if you have an awesome product, they will definitely buy it.
Remember the time when in-store demonstrations were a thing? Yeah, those were great times. But then COVID happened and put a stop to it. That was one of the best ways for consumers to try samples in retail stores. But, not anymore. There is a new approach to in-store sampling. And it is called cashback rewards. We are not talking about a small cashback reward. We are talking 100% cashback rebates to your customers, just for trying your product.
Product trial solutions like Sampoll, have recently developed a new Rapid Rebate™ approach to reimburse your shoppers within 1-3 days of uploading a proof of purchase receipt to our AI-powered chat ambassador “Sam”. Instead of using paper coupons, Sampoll implements multi-channel consumer targeting capabilities to target your consumers based on their interests and location to introduce them to your product. “Sam” will have trackable 1:1 conversations with your consumer to educate them about your brand, and your product.
No worries, Sam gets their personality from you. Sam mimics your brand’s tone and personality when communicating with your consumer, so everything stays on brand. It’s a risk free opportunity for your consumers to try your products at nearby retailers, while having the option to receive additional incentives in the future.
Typical performance for grocery/retail coupons is 3-5% redemption rates on average, while Sampoll's Rapid Rebate™ are performing at 10-20% redemption rates, nearly a 2X - 3X better performance than traditional coupons.

28,https://www.sampoll.co/post/is-guerrilla-street-marketing-the-new-normal-in-2021,"With an increase in the percentage of Americans getting COVID vaccines, there seems to be a light at the end of the tunnel and glimpses of hope that we may be heading towards a sense of normalcy in 2021.
Have you noticed an uptick of people venturing out on the town and feeling more comfortable leaving their houses? If you are a brand that has completely halted in-store or in-person(In Real Life) promotional activity, “guerrilla street marketing” can be a cost-effective solution (as you are closely watching every marketing dollar you spend) to drive more brand activations.
What Is Guerrilla Street Marketing?
According to Hubspot the term “guerrilla marketing” was created in the early 1980s by the late business writer Jay Conrad Levinson is a marketing tactic that uses guerrilla techniques mostly to play on the element of surprise. It sets out to create highly unconventional campaigns that catch people unexpectedly in the course of their day-to-day routines.
Guerrilla street marketing can take the form of adding something to a pre-existing urban environment like putting Gold Toe Underwear on the Charging Bull Statue on Wall Street , break dancing in a train station in the UK for the cookie brand, McVities , promoting a product or service at a concert like Coachella , or all of the above with experiential guerilla marketing that requires consumers to interact with the brand through unique and immersive experiences!
Why Guerrilla Marketing? Why Now?
There are four main reasons why you as a brand should “go guerrilla” according to the national firm ATN Event Staffing.
+ Budget-Friendly
Compared to other experiential marketing strategies, guerrilla marketing relies more on creativity rather than a huge budget. This makes it an ideal strategy for brands and organizations of any size.
+ High-Impact
Any time a company can catch a consumer off guard and create an instant positive impression is a win. Consumers will remember the moment and share it…and in the long run, become customers and loyalists.
+ Versatile
Guerrilla marketing can be executed just about anywhere and at any time, leaving you the flexibility to execute on your terms.
+ Easy and Quick to Launch and Execute
Guerrilla marketing thrives on simplicity, therefore, the lead time to launch an activation is relatively short.
The Time is Now!
Live brand experiences are powerful, they are impactful, and most importantly, they offer real-life connections – and right now, that’s what people miss the most. It’s time for brands to shine and to get back out there, and guerrilla street marketing will help you to do just that while you wait for live in-person demos and public events (like music festivals) to finally return. I wouldn’t hold my breath...no one really knows exactly when they will be back.

29,https://www.sampoll.co/post/product-sampling-for-reviews,"Written by: Ashley Randall
When was the last time you made a purchase without looking at the reviews first? According to Qualtrics, 93% of consumers say online reviews determine their final buying decisions. If your brand is lacking product reviews, how is that affecting your business? For CPG food and beverage brands, it could be tough receiving reviews from your consumers. If you are a new brand starting out, it is essential to have reviews so that your new customers can trust that your product is good before risking any cost. One of the best ways to break that barrier is to try product sampling.
Product sampling is a marketing tactic that allows consumers to sample your product before they buy. It's an effective motivational marketing strategy to build awareness of your brand, while potentially gaining a new loyal customer. They will have the opportunity to taste your product, leaving them wanting more. Prior to COVID, most CPG brands would set up in-store sampling in retail stores. This was very popular until COVID mandated limited exposure to others and in-store sampling came to a screeching stop.
Now, brands have implemented online product sampling through redemption programs. This way, they are able to reach new consumers online, based on their location and interests. Speaking of online, there are a lot of CPG businesses moving towards digital marketing strategies to reach more of their target audiences. Not only are they using online tactics for product sampling opportunities, they are asking for reviews as well.
Using almost the same tactic, asking your customers for an online review is very essential for your brand. Not only will it build your brand’s credibility, it will create a sense of trust for new and loyal consumers.
Product reviews are important to the brand because it gives you a better understanding of what your consumers like and don’t like about you and your products. Reviews are important to the customer because it gives them insight about you and your product, based on what others are saying. As a CPG brand, you want to generate as many customer reviews as possible, because it's free word of mouth marketing for your products and it helps generate more buzz around them, which results in higher sales.
Positive reviews create buying motives for the consumer, making them have the urge or desire to make a purchase. Customer review images are more convincing to other customers, because they can see the product. This creates great consumer behavior motivation that will be psychologically satisfying to their want or need when it comes to their buying decision. This is what you want for your brand.
Here’s how to receive positive reviews. CPG brands can try giving out free product samples and potentially turn your customers into unofficial brand ambassadors that will help spread the good word about your brand. And the best part about it is free word of mouth advertising from customer advocates.
Now you may be thinking, “This sounds great and all, but how can I use this strategy for my business?” Well, we are glad that you asked. Here are some ways to receive reviews through free product samples.
One way to get product reviews is by simply asking your current consumers. Reach out to them via email, and ask how their experience has been with your product and your brand, or, you can use a solution like Sampoll to implement a product sampling program to get new consumers to try your product, and then write a review.
Besides your brand’s website, social media is a great place for your consumers to leave reviews. Using hashtags, your consumers can do a customer review Instagram post to share their honest opinions about your product. That may sound scary, but it’s actually a good thing. Others who may have never heard of your product before will see the consumer’s post and could be inspired to try it out for themselves.
The same thing works for 5 star customer reviews. Most people consider 5 star reviews as a great thing. Some don’t even bother reading the review, they just look at the ratings. On the contrary, there is a lot of emotion that comes within the review. You can tell how happy or unhappy a customer is by looking into the sentiment analysis using product review data. Here, you can pinpoint any issues (if any) your customer base is having with your product or brand.
Sampoll is an omni-channel product trial solution for CPG brands to empower shoppers through product sampling! To help reach new consumers, based on their interests and location to introduce them to your product through free samples.
Instead of them waiting for their products in the mail, like other sampling providers, they can easily go get their products from their local stores. Once they purchase the product, they snap a picture of the product along with the receipt, upload the picture to the Sampoll chat ambassador, “Sam”, and within 72 hours, they will receive their cashback rebate.
Afterwards, our chat ambassador, “Sam”, will reach out to them asking to share their experience. This is how you obtain product reviews. It is a fun experience for the consumer, and something that they will never forget.
If you need more product reviews for your brand, contact a Sampoll rep to show you how it all works and run a test and learn campaign to see if Sampoll is a good fit for your brand.

30,https://www.sampoll.co/post/re-imagining-in-store-product-sampling-demos,"Consumer shopping behaviors are changing faster than ever before! The global pandemic has pushed consumers onto the internet to get their dopamine rush from online shopping. In fact, over 4 trillion dollars was spent buying goods online in 2020, which is almost 30% more than the year prior.
The truth is that the pandemic has accelerated consumer behavior online by 5 years and we are now living in a truly omni-channel world where consumers can click a button on their phone and groceries can get delivered right to their doorsteps. Yes it is indeed convenient, but it comes with a cost.
A major hurdle that a lot of food and beverage brands are facing in this “new normal” is getting new customers or existing customers to try out their products. The current COVID variant has many grocery retailers uncertain about instore sampling which was a vital part for food and beverage brands driving new product trial and new lifetime customers.
In the past, instore demo events were not able to get the most value out of customers. Traditionally, consumers would redeem their free sample at the demo booth, and leave without giving any type of feedback or contact information. A word from the wise, if food and beverage companies do not adopt a new sampling marketing strategy they will get left behind.
Fast forward to 2021, and now CPG companies are experimenting with a new approach known as contactless product sampling, where innovative sampling companies like Sampoll use conversational AI technology to collect crucial first-party and zero party consumer data in near real-time rather than waiting several months for an overpriced store level report that
Let’s face it, we don’t live in the same world. Covid-19 has forced companies to change rapidly and in some aspects permanently. During the pandemic it was impossible to set up an instore demonstration. Essentially half of the Instore demo companies in the US went out of business due to the sudden halt in wet sampling! This forced companies to innovate ways to organize product demonstrations. This has given birth to new and creative ways to get products in consumer’s hands. Retail technology companies like Sampoll facilitate rebate programs (50-100% off), promoted and distributed via artificially intelligent branded chat experiences and it does all the redemption and fulfillment of the rebates for you!
Digital consumer sampling programs garner invaluable information both before and after they claim their offer. For example, indispensable data points such as product reviews, customer persona details, email info, etc. This data can be used to enhance your product, improve customer relationship with a personalized touch, and in return level up the customer experience. To add to that Sampoll has created a way to retarget customers and encourage them to buy again while simultaneously capturing additional product insights.
To survive and thrive in the CPG industry means adapting and making necessary changes. In this day and age that means companies must have some type of online presence coupled with social media. Companies can now build brand awareness, get thousands of impressions, and gather key data to provide a more personalized customer experience but it cant stop there.
Unlike traditional in store demonstrations, the future of product sampling begins online and drives the consumer to make an instore purchase. This is carried out by capturing the consumer while they surf the net on their mobile or other devices, similar to the way traditional instore sampling captured the folks perusing the aisles of grocery stores, but in a digital fashion, and with the ability to reach tens of thousands of potential hyper targeted customers !
It is important to note that both an online and offline presence are essential for CPG brands to thrive. Companies should strategically provide traditional retail outlets, as well as the opportunity for consumers to shop online. Furthermore by incorporating a “Click to Brick'' marketing strategy, CPG companies can leverage the power of the internet and the brick and mortar experience from their retail partners.
One advantage with the “Click to Brick'' strategy is the ability to hyper target qualified shoppers to click your offer, and entice them to visit local retail brick and mortar locations that sell your product. While instore demos provide a physical touchpoint which still serves its purpose, it lacks the scalability, actionable insights, and is cost prohibitive.
Here are some of the benefits of utilizing this omni-channel business model:

31,https://www.sampoll.co/post/redemption-programs-for-cpg-brands,"Written by: Ashley Randall
The stakes are high for the CPG industry, as the potential lost revenue from brand switching is estimated at $1.6 trillion USD, a 29% increase from 2010 according to a study done by Accenture. In addition, Deloitte recently came out with a study that shows brand loyalty in several major product categories has declined over the years. The problem that most CPG brands are facing now is brand awareness and a failure to implement redemption programs into their marketing strategies. Due to the shortages of staff, increase of material costs, and declining profits, some CPG brands are struggling to stay afloat. By implementing a redemption program for your brand, you will be able to connect with your consumers, while learning their interests and behaviors on an ongoing basis.
A redemption program is an incentive-based marketing strategy to help bring awareness to your products for consumers who haven’t purchased your products yet. This is a great opportunity for emerging CPG brands who are looking for their products to stand out against the competition.
Common incentives brands use are reward points to create consumer loyalty, contests to create engagement, or product sampling to create what we like to call “sensory marketing”. Remember a time pre-covid where you would go to the grocery store and there would be people giving out samples to the shoppers? Yes, that is sensory marketing where the shopper could see, touch, smell, and taste the sample before buying the product.
Before buying the product, they were able to experience the “awesome-ness” of that product. Letting consumers try your product before the commitment of purchasing it is the best form of incentive marketing for your redemption program.
We all want the best for our consumers, which means that we are looking to pick the best redemption brand out there. While there are many to choose from, you must know what to look for when making your decision.
Each redemption brand has their own pros and cons, so it all depends on what your incentive marketing goals are. If you would like to reach new consumers and stand out against the shelf competition, using product sampling is the best way to do it.
For emerging CPG brands out there, we know that you are hungry for brand awareness and would love to reach new consumers, so this incentive is perfect for your brand. We understand how much of a headache it could be researching different tools to drive product trials, so we are going to make it easy for you.
Sampoll is a retail solution for CPG brands to empower shoppers through product sampling experiences, rewards, and insights!
The platform is able to mimic a CPG brand’s tone of voice, even sense of humor to communicate with your consumers, using a new chat ambassador technology. Using multi-channel consumer targeting capabilities, Sampoll targets consumers based on their interests and location to introduce a product to them.

Who would have thought? Honestly… Who would have thought how much impact COVID would have on the retail space in 2022? From contactless curbside pickup to groceries delivered onto your doorstep, retailers are making it easier for their consumers to shop using technology. When it comes to retail sampling, consumers aren’t seeing in-store demo products as they have in the past. Since there aren’t many brick and mortar retailers doing store demos anymore, many CPG brands are moving towards using retail sampling technology.
According to PPMS, 81% of respondents said they would walk up to a kiosk of a brand if they offered a free sample. Consumers always favor free samples. But what happens when most of your customers aren’t physically visiting retail stores anymore? Let’s explore a new way to offer product sampling to new and existing consumers with online retail strategies.
Retail sampling is part of an experimental marketing strategy to introduce products to new and existing consumers. This helps increase sales and build brand awareness and loyalty for consumer packaged good brands in retail stores. Before COVID-19, CPG brands participated in retail store sampling to allow consumers to test their products while in the store. The great thing about product sampling is that many customers look forward to trying samples in the store.
Popular retail stores such as Trader Joes, Costco, Publix, Sam's Club, and Whole Foods were known for being the “free sample” capitals. Many customers would shop in those stores just to receive a free sample of anything they can get their hands on. While some retailers still allow some in-store demos, most brands are switching up their retail strategy to keep up with current trends in retail technology.
As we move into the digital world, CPG brands must find new, creative ways to market their products in stores and online. It starts with creating a new retail strategy. This involves making a retail marketing plan to sell your products in the stores by setting up the price, incentives, promotions, product placement, displays, and customer demographics per store location.
Another way to think of it is in-store shopper marketing. It is to help guide consumers through their path to purchase in the retail store with displays, incentives and promotions. Display advertisements will get the customer’s attention. Incentives, such as samples, will entice the customer. And promotions such as coupons will help influence the customer to make a purchase. But since most consumers are shopping online using apps and websites, it is best to create an online retail strategy.

With that in mind, here are a few new exciting solutions we're rolling out to kick-off the year right!
Say hello to our little friend, Sam! Time to throw away those boring old surveys and replace it with Conversational Data Collection. Did you know that a study done in 2019 showed that 86% of consumers say they’d prefer to interact with a chatbot or voice assistant vs. filling out a form on a website? Think of Sam as your virtual brand ambassador that can potentially have thousands of simultaneous conversations at scale with your customers. No more training inexperienced brand ambassadors, no more chasing down reports, Sam does all the heavy lifting so you don’t have to.
From product sampling pop-ups to digital experiences, the Sampoll platform offers turnkey solutions to help brands expand (or pivot) their product sampling campaigns in the digital environment.
80% of customers say the experience a company provides is as important as its products or services.
Brands today are using Sampoll to run virtual wine tastings, cooking experiences, quizzes, and other fun community activation activities to both engage current customers and attract new customers.
The Sampoll platform allows brands to set up, manage, and execute product sampling experiences all in one place while also collecting actionable first-party customer feedback.
Product sampling audience segmentation like you’ve never seen it before.
We all know audience segmentation as it applies to email marketing & other personalized campaigns (more on this subject in a future post). We’ve also all been to Costco and tried a product that we never purchased.
The Sampoll Audience Segmentation feature helps brands better quantify who’s MOST likely to buy after they tried a sample. This helps speed up path-to-purchase, as well as, informs marketers how to better create “pre and post-purchase” experiences for future sampling campaigns.

41,https://www.sampoll.co/post/sampoll-vs-surveymonkey-reviews,"We are not here to bash SurveyMonkey. Truth be told they are the biggest survey management platform in the world with an impressive customer base that includes 98% of Fortune 500 companies and even more impressive is that over 147 million SurveyMonkey surveys have been sent over the past 20 years!
This post focuses on comparing the experience your customers will have when providing product feedback on Sampoll vs. SurveyMonkey.
There’s a pretty good chance you have already taken a survey from SurveyMonkey. Does this experience stand out to you? Did this survey make you feel any different than any other survey you have ever taken in your life? If the answer is no then we are in agreement. How about a highly engaged personal conversation you may have had at a beer/wine festival with a brand rep? If you answered yes then you are not alone!
The internet is rife with cases of survey form abandonment. A recent study found that more than 80% of participants had recently abandoned at least one web form mid-way.
1). Sampoll attaches real-time dynamic conversation flows. While you can integrate SurveyMonkey into Manychat to run a chatbot flow sequence, the challenge is you need the technical know-how to execute.
Most early stage companies are operating with lean budgets and small teams - thus trying to piece meal together a campaign might not work so effectively. Unfortunately, it may require a high level of technical knowledge to understand how specific tools work together in SurveyMonkey’s third-party app ecosystem. “Ain’t nobody got time for that!”
Sampoll, however, offers ease-of-setup making the go-to-market process much faster for lean and nimble teams. Since we’re focused on product sampling engagements - we also collect that data with our NEW conversational data collection feature which then allows brands to have two-way dialogue that builds a real sense of trust and loyalty with your customers quicker and stands out from the “advertising noise” from other marketing channels.
2). Integrating the data collection process into the experience. The traditional survey approach that you find on platforms like SurveyMonkey sends a survey before or after the “event” has occurred. Sampoll is introducing a new method of collecting customer feedback while a customer is going through the experience. It’s an interactive feedback experience with quicker feedback loops for your customers rather than a stale one-sided task that feels like an overwhelming chore.
3). Product sampling experiences aren't just consumer facing - it's also the ""business of the business"" that matters as well. Not only do brands need to track the number of samples given (which equates to some potential loss), but then they need to track the conversion rate on that sampling campaign in order to justify ROI.
Where sampoll differentiates from SurveyMonkey is the ability to run all important facets of a sampling campaign, collect the data, and track metrics like product inventory and sales lift all in one platform.
Don’t give your customers another boring survey. Give them a Sampoll experience and watch your customer satisfaction scores and customer loyalty flourish!"

43,https://www.sampoll.co/post/sms-marketing-for-cpg-companies,"Written by: Ashley Randall
Almost everyone in the world now owns a cellphone. It’s no surprise that people check their phones up to 160 times a day, or once every 9 minutes, to look at text messages, social media feeds, emails, and more according to Findstack. The question is who would have thought a simple text message could help bring in more sales for your CPG business? This is just scratching the surface of what SMS Marketing can do for your brand!
We know that marketing can be challenging for a startup in the CPG space, because it is so competitive. To become successful in this industry, you need a solid CPG digital marketing strategy to promote your products. For those brands that are just starting out, it is important to implement a plan that is cost efficient, effective, and has a great ROI. You can get all of them with SMS Marketing.
SMS (Short Messaging Service) Marketing is a marketing strategy used to create and send promotional SMS text messages to potential, new, and existing customers. Some people use the terms Text Messaging Marketing or Mobile Messaging Marketing for Businesses. It is a form of digital marketing that some brands fail to use. Either way, they are the same thing and have grown popular over the last decade.
Businesses in other industries, including beauty and health, entertainment, real estate, healthcare, and retail shopping, use the power of text messages to communicate with their customers or clients. And since CPG brands often fall into the retail industry, it is almost a no brainer why your business should hop on board.
There are many ways to use SMS marketing. All depending on the type of campaign you are going for. Most businesses use this strategy to promote new and existing products, sales on products, coupon giveaways, service reminders, birthday or special event promotions, you name it. But as a business, you should focus on the SMS campaigns, which will help generate more CPG sales and customer service.
Since text messaging is a two-way form of communication, it is personal. So when you are developing a SMS campaign strategy, you want to focus on who you are reaching out to, the time you send out your messages, and the main goal on what you want your consumers to do next.
You always want to include a link within the text message for customers to click on. This will take them to the next step of the desired action you want them to take. You can promote a new product on your website, send a link to a digital coupon, or sign up to receive a free sample. These three campaigns will help increase your sales velocity in your partnered retail stores.
This is a great way to let your consumers know about new and upcoming products to try. You would want to send this text message to your consumers, who are already familiar with your existing products. If they loved your product or brand enough to sign up for SMS messages, they would want to know about any new items you may have.
Using this tactic will get your customers excited, especially because they will feel as if they are the first to know about it. Psychologically, everyone loves to be the first to know something. It gives them the upper hand against everyone else. They love the “I know something you don’t know” feeling, so always take that into consideration.
Also, you can promote sales. Can you imagine how excited your consumer will get once they receive a text message saying, “Guess what! Our chocolate bars are on sale at Walmart right now! Hurry while supplies last.” The sky's the limit when it comes to the creative ways you can promote your products.
Coupons will forever be a great strategy for CPG marketing. It's a great incentive to give your consumers so that they always want to buy your product. Since paper coupons have become a thing of the past, digital coupons have stepped in its place and taken over. Consumers now can pull coupons from their phones. And that makes it easy for CPG brands to capitalize on the market.
The best way to use this method with SMS marketing is to generate coupons with barcodes or QR codes. You can include a link to the coupon in your text message, so that your consumers can let a cashier scan the code. It’s that easy. So easy that your customers will look forward to future SMS messages from you in the future.
Since we’ve stepped into a post-COVID world, in-store sample demonstrations aren’t as popular as before. Despite the world slowly opening up again, some people still have the mindset of distancing themselves from others in retail stores. But that didn’t stop CPG brands from thinking outside the box. Now, they are thinking digitally.
Consumer packaged goods marketing agencies and consultants are now implementing redemption programs for sampling. The idea is for your customers to sign up for samples, and after a week or two, they will receive it right on their front door. Or, they can get their sample directly from the retail store and later receive a cashback rebate. This method is great, because you can send your consumers a link within the SMS message that will take them directly to the free samples sign up page.
Besides increasing CPG sales, one of the best things SMS marketing can do is help your brand engage with your audience. SMS marketing can help you stay connected with your potential, new, and existing customers by engaging with them. You will be able to track the progress of your campaigns and provide customer services for consumers who need additional support.
Tracking SMS engagement will give you insight into what your consumers like and do not like. You can measure what type of campaign has a higher click through rate compared to others. This tells you if your customers favor coupons or samples, and vice versa. You will always gain knowledge of which product they adore over others. Or which retail store they like over others, especially if you have coupons for the same product at two or more different retail stores. This will help you track the effectiveness of your distribution.
Customers prefer texting a business, rather than making a phone call nowadays. This is because they like the instant two-way communication it offers, especially when there is an issue they want resolved or additional information. This can be set up as an auto response, but if an issue can’t be resolved by text message, a link to your website or phone number can be provided for further assistance.
Sampoll is a new conversational marketing solution for CPG brands that leverages similar technology used by a SMS marketing software solution. Sampoll developed an AI-powered chatbot messenger called “Sam” to have text conversations with your consumers. Sam isn’t a regular, nonchalant chatbot you chat with on every other website.
“Sam” is full of personality, one that matches the tone of your CPG brand. That way it's not just dull text on a screen...it's full of bright and exciting product imagery and video content to showcase your brand, fun and familiar emojis, occasional dad jokes and visual GIFs that bring the conversation alive in a whole new way!
“Sam” also helps you promote your products, coupon giveaways, and free sample redemptions to your consumers. You can run all your SMS campaigns with Sampoll, so that you can get the best of both worlds without paying for additional SMS software.
Lastly, “Sam” collects opt-in customer panel data, including opt-in emails from consumers taking advantage of your free sample product trial campaigns. Unlike other product sampling providers, we provide first-party data from your consumers based on their feedback conversation with “Sam”. You will learn more about your consumers through our analytics insight dashboard. While the consumers learn about your brand, bringing customer relationships to the next level.
If you are looking for an SMS marketing software that will help you reach new and existing customers, promote products, coupons, and samples, while gaining customer insight from engagement, schedule a demo with Sampoll. A Sampoll rep will show you how it all works."
44,https://www.sampoll.co/post/the-future-of-in-store-sampling-staff,"In store sampling has always been the gold standard when it comes to immersive experiences to create awareness and drive initial sales in brick and mortar stores. This type of instore advertising allows potential customers the chance to engage one-on-one with promotional events staff aka brand ambassadors to create more personable and memorable experiences. Brand ambassadors are not only creating that initial impression of the brand but also serve as an extension of the sales team to ultimately drive a purchase. Brands often see a lift in sales in the days after an event takes place but the impact is most often short lived and isn’t a sustainable solution for long-term store level sales growth.
Which brings us to the several drawbacks that come with using in store sampling for CPG product promotion. To do this at scale it becomes cost prohibitive and time consuming when you factor in hourly wage expenses, training, staff reliability, and any data or reporting to assess in store sampling effectiveness.
Therefore, it is imperative that CPG brands also incorporate more scalable engagement programs such as contactless digital product sampling campaigns. Here are a few other limitations of the in store sampling model:
An alternative and innovative way of sampling product is to enact an online based product sampling strategy. This strategy involves the use of a powerful virtual chat ambassador that would replace in store sampling staff, and allow customers to engage whenever and wherever they are.
Not only is this online solution truly scalable but you are guaranteed to collect valuable customer data like e-mail, first name, and interests to build upon and create new customer personas and audiences. This information is critical to achieve success in an online and mobile first world.
Digital product sampling campaigns are more efficient and have a few significant benefits when compared to the traditional in store model:"
45,https://www.sampoll.co/post/the-shoppers-emotional-connection-to-product-sampling,"As a consumer, the simple experience of walking into a retail store and seeing booths setup with free samples is now an incredibly nostalgic experience. Product sampling has always been a highly emotional and inviting tactic...providing an instant gratification and engaging all 5 senses. The key is in creating positive associations and reinforcing that dopamine drip in the brain that activates when we see “new” and “free” things. It’s a clever way to break the brain out of its baseline mode as the consumer walks through a store, gently nudging them to take notice because there’s something new to discover in an entirely risk-free way! It also plays into the law of Reciprocity (more about that in a future post).
What we may have lost sight of though, during this pandemic (for obvious reasons), is just how powerful this tactic can be now as consumers long for a sense of “return to normalcy”. The sample filled physical shopping experience is one of the clearest representations of the good old (pre-pandemic) days, and it will emerge from this anxious and uncertain period in retail as one of, if not the most obvious solutions to excite and engage shoppers. Now more than ever the shopping experience is truly about the experience of shopping, and product sampling is hands down the OG experiential tactic when it comes to product marketing!
A Twitter user recently posted this tweet that quickly received over seven thousand likes:
Is she kidding? Probably. But it’s also a highly relatable example of how most of us are feeling with regard to the desire to get back to what we perceive to be “normal”. One of the interesting takeaways here is that while we as marketers spend so much time thinking about how NOT to be normal, in this particular case you can confidently spend that brain power elsewhere. In 2020 and 2021, normal is the most exciting experience a shopper can have!
""That's great, but what can I do while normal just isn't an option, smartypants?"" The short answer is to consider embracing a DTC sampling model and do more online engagements. The good news is that there is a light at the end of the Covid tunnel, but it's never a bad idea to bolster your digital engagement capabilities in order to maximize your reach even in a post Covid world.
As you’re considering ways to ensure your brand stands out, make sure you’re including this tried and true tactic in meaningful ways and giving your consumers what they need...that nostalgic sense of normal. As always, the team here at Sampoll looks forward to helping you create and track all of your pre-purchase experiences whether in-store or online, we've got you covered!

46,https://www.sampoll.co/post/what-is-a-digital-launchpad-for-cpg-brands,"Let's face it, the future is digital. This means CPG brands are starting to implement changes in how they conduct marketing demos. In the past, cpg retail brands relied on in person demonstration events to showcase their products. It was thought to be the only way of getting people to try products for free.
In-store demos come with inherent obstacles. For example, limited customer reach due to limitations of daily foot traffic per store. Also, a possibility of exposing your product to uninterested audiences which doesn’t equate to more retail sales. Chances are that a good portion of shoppers that walk by your in-store demo may not necessarily fancy your superfood bars or veggie burgers.
In addition, relying on in person staff to properly demonstrate your product and educate the customer in a clear and concise manner can prove to be troublesome. Moreover, in person demonstrations don’t acquire customer information that can be used for future retargeting purposes.
There are many more problematic consequences that can arise if companies continue to use this outdated model of product demonstrations. Consequences such as poor marketing budget management, and fruitless campaigns that don’t produce noteworthy results.
There are many benefits to pivoting towards a digital form of product demonstrations. Digital demonstrations only must be produced once, and customers can watch on-demand content and rewatch it as many times as they want!
That’s unlimited playback ability, in comparison to one-time product demonstration events. Digital demos offer a contactless presentation, which is very important to many people in the post-covid landscape.
Digital demos allow your product to be displayed to thousands of more people all over the globe, and/or can be segmented to be shown in certain areas of your choice. Leveraging online launchpad demos allows for more accurate audience targeting. For example, sending free natural product ads to health-conscious individuals.
Furthermore, brands can use influencers on social media and other platforms to showcase their products. Influencers usually have a strong impact in their communities and can create great awareness for CPG brands.
In addition, brands have begun to leverage new demos by leveraging programs like Amazon Launchpad, among others . The digital launch pad is basically a place where companies can showcase their new products to amazon’s customer base. This is a very smart way to promote and gain massive exposure for product launches.
Lastly, a retail tech solution known as Sampoll is leading the way in CPG with a new digital-first product sampling platform for retail which makes the digital demonstration process fun and exciting for customers looking to try products for free in nearby retail stores.
Sampoll is powered by AI chat technology that engages consumers and provides an amazing chat experience combined with visual presentation of your products. This entices customers to explore a variety of items such as nature to go products and healthy vegan snacks. Customers can leave free product reviews which are critical so that CPG brands can accurately assess the public’s view on their products and make changes accordingly."
47,https://www.sampoll.co/post/what-is-contactless-product-sampling-for-cpg-brands,"It goes without saying that conventional in-store sampling has been practiced by a variety of CPG brands throughout history because it works. Studies show that 73% of consumers are more likely to buy an item if they get to try it first.
However, these traditional practices come with limitations for brands. For example, there is a lack of first-party customer data that can be used for retargeting customers. In addition, any in-person product sampling model must follow sanitary guidelines and maintain social distancing in this post-pandemic world. Other limitations are:
This is where contactless product sampling comes into play. Contactless is one of the newest and most seamless types of product sampling ideas being leveraged by innovative brands and CPG marketers. There are different types of contactless product sampling companies. For example, some use contactless delivery, and some companies drive consumers directly into retail stores to pick up their free products like they do with Sampoll. No longer will you as a brand have to deal with poorly trained staff at product tasting events and keeping tabs to make sure they even show up for their shifts!
Consumers are simply instructed to go find their product at a specific retail location like Whole Foods, ACME Stores, or Walmart. They can even go pick up their products the same day! This is a stark contrast to other virtual product sampling companies which make users wait up to 4-6 weeks for their product sample bags or boxes due to a shipping-based product delivery business model. And to make matters worse most consumers do not qualify for the free products they sign up for so they give away their personal information and receive nothing in exchange. This does not make a lot of sense if you ask a lot of consumers, and It's quite frustrating, to say the least.
Some other key benefits of contactless product sampling include:
Traditional in-store product sampling can be frustrating for some CPG brands. Sampoll has talked directly with hundreds of brands all who mention it can be very time-consuming, inefficient, and costly to run in-store demos.
As a matter of fact, it costs some national brands as much as $165 to hire staff and set up in-store demos for 4 hours at Whole Foods. In addition, this type of product sampling does not guarantee to target the appropriate audience for CPG brands. Oftentimes consumers will sample products and don’t purchase or leave any type of feedback or valuable data.
If this sounds familiar it can feel like your CPG brand is literally wasting precious inventory and marketing dollars and you have nothing to show for it. Training and scheduling outside temporary in-store demo staff take time away from you running your business! Most of them do not represent your brand in an accurate way and half of the time they do not show up to store events! It never feels like your marketing dollars are spent well with in-store demos.
Moreover, traditional in-store product sampling simply is not as efficient as its contactless counterpart. The two can not be compared when it comes to scalability and data-driven targeting. You might only get 100-200 unqualified shoppers to walk by your in-store booth at the grocery store but with tools like Sampoll you can target thousands of qualified shoppers in a single month that live near your retailer partners!
Contactless product sampling is the future of product sampling marketing and product testing. Through the use of artificial intelligence, you can gather critical information about your consumers before and after the digital sampling process. Important data such as sample product reviews can be used for improving the consumer experience and building brand value.
With contactless product sampling, you do not have to waste your precious time and dollars training staff, or manually scheduling in-store demos with retailers. In addition, by leveraging the power of online advertising, your campaigns will reach interested audiences at scale. Your ad placements will be shown to literally thousands of potential customers within a 15-mile radius of your retail partners. Lastly, your campaigns can run for an entire month versus traditional demo events which are much more limited to just a few days.
Fun fact: 63 Percent of Shopping Journeys Start Online (Think with Google)
It's simply a no-brainer that food and beverage companies should start to experiment with contactless product sampling. Especially in these uncertain times, where we simply can not rely on the traditional ways of interacting with shoppers. That means moving forward and leading the way by adopting new and improved marketing strategies.
As a CPG brand, it is critical to generate sales velocity and get people to try your product. You are competing with well-established brands that have a very loyal customer base and massive marketing budgets to stay “top-of-mind”. By using contactless product sampling, you can quickly build brand awareness, loyalty and target specific audiences to try your products in a more intelligent and cost-effective way! Not to mention, it’s COVID-safe.
Online campaigns are highly efficient and convert more customers than traditional in-store product sampling. Contactless product sampling will help drive more revenue which is vital for CPG brands. It also helps brands build great relationships with their retailers by increasing foot traffic in their stores through click-to-brick product sampling tools like Sampoll.

Singer Beyonce aka“Queen B” in one of her famous songs, “Run The World (Girls)” asks the question “Who runs the world?” That’s simple. E-commerce runs the world!
The majority of businesses are making a digital transformation, while 91% have already adopted a digital-first business strategy or plan to do so (IDG). So what does that mean for CPG brands in the food and beverage industry? McKinsey reports on US shopping behavior and says online grocery purchases have been clicking with consumers, setting the stage for DTC. 61 percent of shoppers bought more groceries online than pre-Covid. Americans love to shop, and increasingly, they love to shop online. Not only with retailers, but manufacturers.
According to a study done by XP2, the Food and Beverage industry has an average shopping cart abandonment rate of over 55%. That means that 1 out of every 2 shoppers that are ready to check out of their shopping cart, suddenly get cold feet and leave your online store without making a purchase that day! What can you do to reduce shopping cart abandonment? You should implement an e-commerce sampling strategy and de-risk the buyer journey for your online store.
E-commerce sampling is a method being utilized by digital marketers in the CPG industry to activate new customers through brand awareness and soliciting feedback from online shoppers with free product sampling offers and giveaways! Think of it as an icebreaker. It encourages shoppers to try something new without having to pay full price for the item.
Did someone say first-party shopper data? It’s one thing to drive short term sales lift at your retail partners but it’s another thing to truly understand who your customers are. It’s no surprise that major retailers seem to keep that type of data on their shoppers a secret and vendors feel left in the dark.
You are essentially getting rid of the middle man(retailers) with e-commerce sampling as you collect pertinent information directly from interested product testers. You establish that direct line to communicate with each and every product tester that requests a sample via your online store and can track them from the time they sample your product to the time they purchase. This plays a big advantage for brands that implement a Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) marketing strategy. You will have total control on how you promote and sell to your consumers. This immediately eliminates the constant threat from competitors in your category that your products are up against on the shelves at retailers.
For food and beverage CPG brands, activities like DTC food sampling is one of the best marketing strategies you can use for your brand. Consumers love brands who make an effort to connect with them on a personal and emotional level, and the best place to start is your website/online store.
E-commerce sampling requires a great marketing offering approach . We suggest you create a free product offering because it will add more value to your potential online shoppers and generate more interest in your brand and products, while increasing your sales.
There are two sampling methods you can use: Direct from your website, or through a Third-party platform. You can set up a form on your online store, for instance, to request a sample of food. This is a great way to retain customer loyalty. However, if your goal is to find new customers, you must think of a way to drive new consumers to your website.
The old adage “Build it and they will come” no longer holds that much value when it comes to DTC brands in the CPG space. Luckily there are third party marketing tools and CPG marketing agencies/consultants that can help bring more traffic and attention to your online storefront.
In May of 2021 the team at Sampoll introduced the latest innovation in product education and customer engagement for the CPG industry, known as Digital Chat Ambassadors(DCAs). Instead of hiring staff to manage in-store demos, these chatbots specially-designed to be a digital ambassador of your brand to new and existing consumers, while collecting their demographic and behavior data to ensure that they have a true interest in your product.
If you are stuck on the fence between the two options, here is a solution. Sampoll will act as a merger of both sampling methods. Using multi-channel consumer targeting capabilities, Sampoll targets consumers based on their interests and location to introduce your product to them, while AI-powered Chat Ambassador, “Sam”, builds customer relationships by keeping them engaged, educating them on your product, while collecting customer feedback.
To help get your existing customers on board, Sampoll now provides a “Request a Sample” e-commerce solution to drive product trials/sampling and sales on your website/online store. Sampoll supports direct integration into Shopify so you can turn samplers into lifetime customers right from the Sampoll Chat Ambassador experience! This will de-risk the buyer experience for consumers who may not want to commit to your product.
When you think about it, it's not many consumers who turn down samples. When customers are visiting your website/online store and see a “send me a sample” option, their interest level peaks through the roof. A report from Sampling Effectiveness Advisors shares this statistic: 73% of consumers said they were likely to buy a product after trying it. Whether they have previously tried your products or not, they want to know how to try more.
All made through consumer activations, “Sam” will have a trackable one on one conversation about your products, providing a risk free opportunity to try your products at nearby retailers with a cashback reward. This is taking a new product for a “test drive” in the CPG space to a new height. Consumers find this process exciting, informative, and trustworthy. This creates an experience that they will never forget because they can redeem these freebies the same day by immediately driving to their nearest participating store or tacking it on to an existing online grocery order!"
49,https://www.sampoll.co/post/what-is-field-marketing-and-how-does-it-work-for-cpg-brands,"According to Repsly, Field Marketing is a branch of marketing in which brands get their products in front of consumers “out in the field” at retail locations, events, college campuses, or in public locations. Field marketing initiatives include promotions, demos, and direct sales.
The objectives of field marketing vary by company and campaign, but some common goals include brand awareness, increased sales at targeted locations, and increased engagement with local buying communities.
Field Marketing Types:
There are 5 major field marketing activities that Paperflite outlines here that can apply directly to CPG brands.
1). Sales:
Highly trained sales staff find, understand, and hold dialogue with the target audience intending to sell. This typically takes place in a face to face engagement during in-person events.
2). Merchandising
Merchandising is the positioning of marketing material (such as posters, shelf barkers) in a retail environment.
Merchandising in field marketing also encompasses:
3). Guerilla Marketing
CPG Brands use the term “guerrilla marketing” to refer to creative campaigns that target consumers in ways and locations they might not expect. Guerrilla marketing campaigns are typically low on spend but high on energy and imagination, and brands often rely heavily on their “feet on the street” to pull them off.
4). Sampling and Demonstrating
A field marketer demonstrates the working of a product to the customer or allows the customer to try/taste a product. CPG brands can benefit greatly by allowing customers to try their product “risk-free” as the stats show 81% of consumers will purchase a product after receiving a sample.
5). Experiential Marketing, Events, and Roadshows
ANA says that Experiential Marketing includes events and sponsorships, but it also understands an experience can be more personal. Its importance lies in its ability to create a relevant bond with the consumer.
Today, experiential marketing includes events and more individual experiences, such as a demonstration of a CPG product's performance, extra care/personal connection, and grassroots/affinity events. The key is creating an experience that stimulates an emotional connection and reinforces the essence of the brand.
Experiential Marketing may also have an entertainment, cause, or celebrity aspect to it.
Use field marketers to gather customer insights.
Engagement in the field is a great way for a CPG brand to learn how well they are perceived in the eyes of the shopper.. Do they have any suggestions on ways to improve the product? Do they think it’s priced fairly? Are they loyal to the brand and, if so, why? Sometimes these questions can be asked in person.
Utilize data collection tools in the field like Sampoll that can equip your field marketers with a mobile app and automatically help you compile reporting on each field event! Other times a survey might be more convenient. The point is to use field marketing to gather intelligence about your customers so that you can better serve them, and, thus, increase sales.

50,https://www.sampoll.co/post/what-is-in-store-demo-staffing,"In store demo staffing consists of hiring staff to conduct in store demonstrations. In store marketing has been a widely used product marketing strategy for decades. Marketing managers often use in store promotions to stimulate the sales of new or existing products.
In store demos are a highly effective form of product advertising. There are many benefits of handing out free samples. For example, it gives CPG brands a chance to reel in customers by letting them trial your product. However, issues have arisen due to new safety guidelines that have been put into place because of the pandemic.
There are also some other setbacks that can occur when hiring staff for in store demonstrations. For example, most of the time the instore marketers hired are not from within the company. Usually, in store demo staff hiring is outsourced to third parties.
This unfortunately means you often end up with poor brand representation. Having well trained in store demo staff and brand ambassadors is critical. Your message and/or products must be presented correctly and professionally. This is paramount to establishing your brand for the long term.
The pandemic basically halted in store demo presentations for most of 2020. CPG brands had no choice but to search for new retail tech solutions, like Sampoll that re-imagine product sampling. For instance, Food and Beverage companies realized that they should not limit themselves to physical in store demo presentations. Instead, CPG brands had to find new ways to promote their products and offer samples to potential clients.
An alternative way to run sampling promotions is to use contactless product sampling programs. These programs are ideal because your business can reap a lot more rewards than by using traditional methods.
Some of the benefits include:

51,https://www.sampoll.co/post/what-is-sales-velocity-in-cpg,"Written by: Ashley Randall
Dr. James Richardson cites in his book, “Ramping up Your Brand”, that “roughly 80 percent of premium food/beverage brands fail to make it past $1 million in retail sales.” It goes without saying that most emerging CPG brands are having a more difficult time with sales velocity than their more established competitors. That may seem like a no brainer, but there are many factors that contribute to this. Lack of awareness, a marketing strategy, and not knowing how to measure their sales velocity in retail stores.
A CPG brand (Consumer Packaged Goods) is a company that manufactures and sells products in retail stores. Those include food and beverages, toiletries, and beauty products that consumers will see on retail shelves. The number one goal of a CPG brand is to sell as many products to their consumers as possible.
The more products being purchased, the higher your sales velocity will be. Retailers love when products are quickly moved on and off the shelves. Not only does that help your brand’s sales quota, it helps the retailer’s bottomline as well.
Sampoll is being used by a wide range of CPG brands, from edible cookie dough brands seen on shark tank, to frozen vegan brands. Our goal is to connect consumers and brands through product sampling experiences, rewards, and insights, that will also increase your sales velocity.
Sales velocity is one of the top 3 metrics your brand should consistently measure to see the overall success of your products. It shows you how fast your product is selling on a weekly basis. In other words, velocity is your sales rate. This information is essential to CPG brands, to see how well your product measures up next to your competitors.
Your product velocity is affected by a number of things: price, the number of distributors/retailers you have, the size of the retailer’s store (this will determine how many units/products you can have on the shelf), any promotions/ads on the products, and coupons available to the consumer. These factors will determine how fast your product sells on a weekly basis.
Retail solutions like Sampoll, can help CPG brands build awareness and drive product trials to increase their sales velocity. How so? By using an incentive-based marketing strategy to help consumers get to know, and purchase your product. In other words, Sampoll is your one-stop-shop for all of your retail product sampling needs!
Instead of using the old school, in-store sampling method, Sampoll uses multi-channel consumer targeting capabilities, based on their interests and location to introduce your products to them. This method is what we call, high velocity sales.
High Velocity Sales (HVS) is a process of using artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to increase the productivity of selling a product or a service. Think of this as effectively moving your consumer through your sales funnel. This is a huge opportunity for CPG brands to explore and help increase their product velocity, while producing new leads through automation.
Sampoll helps this process by using our AI-powered chat ambassador to have a 1 on 1 engaging conversation with your new lead (consumer), sending them to their local retailer to purchase your product, using a cashback reward incentive such as a 100% discount offer.
The retailers will see this as a regular sale, which is great, because this velocity triggers for sale. They will have no idea that this is an incentive for the consumer. Which is also great because with Sampoll’s help, your brand will be able to run this incentive campaign at major retailers like Whole Foods, Walmart, Target, Trader Joe's, Stop & Shop, Earth Fare and many others.
This will give you the chance to maximize your marketing efforts to many distributors/retailers to help increase the availability and exposure of your products, while being accessible to your consumers.
The overall success of your products will determine how widely available it is (distribution) and how well it sells per distributor/retailer (velocity). To get a whole scope of your brand’s success, you should measure the velocity for each product per retailer.
One of the easiest ways to measure your sales velocity is to multiply the number of opportunities (products) on the shelf by the average sales price and the conversation rate, then divide that number by the length of your sales cycle.
The number of products is the number of products you have at that retailer. To find your average sales price is to divide the total revenue earned of a week by the number of products sold that week. Your conversion rate is dividing the number of products sold by the number of opportunities (products) given to the retailer for that week. And your sales cycle is measured by the week, 7 days.
So let’s put in some simple data. Let’s say that product A costs $5.00 and you sent 100 of those products to Walmart for the week. You only sold 78 products during that week, which generated $390. That will make your average sales price $5.00. Your conversion rate will be the number of products sold 78, by the number of products given for that week 100, which would be 0.78.
Sales Velocity = (100 products x $5 x 0.78) / 7 days
Sales Velocity = $390 / 7 days
Sales Velocity = $55.72 a day
This information will tell you how each product is doing per retailer on a weekly basis. From here, you can determine how to successfully market each product and tailor it according to the retailer.
Sampoll is here to make sure that each campaign will be as successful as they can be, through product trials. Not only do we help generate new consumers to your brand, we also provide feedback from your consumers to help you effectively target your marketing dollars, identify behavioral trends, and understand customer sentiment."
52,https://www.sampoll.co/post/why-experience-matters-dunkin-vs-rebel-dog,"Dunkin’ known as Dunkin Donuts is an American Multinational coffee and donut brand that’s been around for 70 years and has been known as a popular coffee stop for most Americans that like a quick cup of joe on the go. According to a recent Instagram poll run by Sampoll, however, 85% of the poll respondents prefer local coffee brand, Rebel Dog Coffee over Dunkin’.
So what? Well, there are several insights we can derive from this, but first we need to understand the underlying trends that are shaping this result. Several studies have shown that consumers are trending towards local providers especially given the hardships that Covid-19 has created for small businesses. Consumers inherently feel an obligation to support local brands now, and that is not likely to subside anytime soon [1]. Another important trend Sampoll has been tracking is the shift towards the local boutique that offers a higher caliber experience and customer service, even if they’re more costly. In fact, 72 percent of consumers indicated that they are willing to pay a local business more for better-quality work [2]. And lets face it...DD isn’t exactly known for their superior craftsmanship or delivery.
There are certainly many factors working against small businesses during this challenging time. That said - the silver lining here is that there’s an enormous opportunity to capitalize on changing consumer habits by focusing on your customer experience, and playing up the intimate relationship/connection a local brand can provide. The truth is that competing on price alone is a futile strategy for small brands, and this poll is just one example that demonstrates why it’s best for local brands to connect with consumers early and often, learn what your local customers love about you, and own the experience!
While these spot polls are fun and engaging for consumers they also serve a very important purpose as we organically engage our communities. Sampoll’s mission is to reimagine Voice of Customer (VoC) analysis through in-store and DTC product feedback and sampling experiences. Sampoll’s omni-channel tools helps to uncover important first party customer data and help brands understand their customer’s taste preferences during the pre-purchase.

53,https://www.sampoll.co/post/wrangling-data-and-driving-insights-through-product-sampling,"Have you heard someone mention “AI” (artificial intelligence) recently? How about “Predictive Analytics”, or “Machine Learning”? There is an extraordinarily wide spectrum of tools that pass themselves off as “AI” today which makes it difficult to identify real value, and understand how to leverage these technologies efficiently within the context of your brand activation events. I’d like to suggest that there is a much more immediate question than how, and that question is...why?
In order to understand why you want to be paying attention to this trend at the very least, it’s important to gain some perspective around the factors that are driving it.
The key takeaway here is simply this:
If you’re not leveraging data to help guide your company, you’re going to be out innovated by competitors that are embracing this trend.
With that in mind, let's consider a hypothetical mid-size CPG organization. This company is constantly searching for opportunities to get their products into the hands of prospective consumers and has recently launched a new product. As part of the product launch they’ve committed to doing several hundred trade tasting (product sampling) events per week over the next month and are hopeful that the campaign will help raise awareness among their target demographic. Their promotional agency promises that staff will keep track of how many samples are given out as well as other relevant information, but they soon find out this information is captured on paper or even worse only exists in the heads of staff members. After each event the event staff is responsible for manually copying all this information into an email which is then sent to the campaign manager for aggregation and distribution.
A month later the campaign wraps up and the organization has seen a small but noticeable uptick in sales. They haven’t invested much in any real advanced analytics platforms or trade promotion management tools and have no way to really analyze the effectiveness of the campaign. When management is asked which events were most successful and why, they’re only able to provide tangential data and assumptions.
What might change if this organization had been made aware of the trends in big data and AI? What if they implemented a solution that would help them effectively categorize and identify insights within the mountains of data they could have been collecting at each of their trade tasting events? A McKinsey report on this very topic highlights a consistent thread between winning CPG organizations that indicates an intentionally data informed approach to trade tasting.
“The winners’ approach to trade investment is similarly data driven. They differentiate trade investments using metrics that cover both outcomes (such as net sales) and activities (such as placement of promotional displays). They track a comprehensive set of key performance indicators and conduct formal reviews, paying special attention to deviations from trade-investment guidelines and imposing more stringent consequences for overspending (such as withholding incentive pay from field reps or canceling planned events with the retailer). All winners use both trade-promotion-management and trade-promotion-optimization tools.” (2)
With this data informed (intelligence based) approach, our hypothetical agency has now uncovered a superpower in the ability to automatically aggregate, organize, and analyze all of the data they had previously failed to capture. Better yet they’re actually able to capitalize on this data in the form of actionable suggestions that help optimize future campaigns and maximize marketing dollars. They’re able to see in real time which events are performing well and why. They’re able to immediately identify trends among staff members, products, and locations. All of this information gives them an objective lens into their consumer’s preferences and habits that means they know longer need to rely on assumptions or tangential information provided by an ill informed trade tasting staff. Best of all - they’ve done this with a single cloud based solution."

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from sampoll.co (the “Site”).
PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”
We collect Device Information using the following technologies:
- “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
- “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
- “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site.
Additionally when you make a purchase, attempt to make a purchase, or request a product, sample, or service through the Site, we collect certain information from you, including your name, billing address, shipping address, payment information (including credit card numbers if required), email address, and phone number. We refer to this information as “Order Information.”
We may collect additional information related to your personal preferences, consumer behaviors, household information, and other self reported data.
When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Order Information.
HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfill any orders placed through the Site (including processing your payment information if required, arranging for shipping, and providing you with invoices and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order Information to:
- Communicate with you;
- Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and
- When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising relating to our products or services.
- Order Information may be shared with third party partners for the purposes of personalizing your consumer experience across their offerings and services.
- We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns and retarget you with other relevant information, advertising, and offerings).
