Hey there!
I’m Amanda Jefferson, owner of Indigo Organizing and one of the world’s first KonMari consultants.
I left an inspiring yet stressful 20-year career to start my own business because I think we’re all too frazzled. I want to help people to have less stuff, less stress, more space AND more time for what MATTERS.
I spend my time in two ways:
working 1-on-1 with private clients who want a calm, organized space, where everything has its place
speaking to groups about finding more joy and simplicity in our work and lives.
Wanna know more about me?
I will flat out refuse to eat an Oreo unless it’s a Double Stuf Oreo. #doublestufornothing #dontforgetthemilk
I trained under Marie Kondo and now I’m a trainer myself. I’m one of only a few KonMari consultants to be chosen to teach the KonMari Method™ to aspiring consultants.
I grew up in a really rural part of Delaware. Our phone number was 422-CORN. Seriously.
I used to be a lot more frazzled, and I had a lot more clutter. A few years ago, I had an inspiring but stressful job. I had a long commute, a baby at home, stuff everywhere and a calendar full of I-don’t-know-what. I was burnt out. SO, I KonMari’d my house and simplified my life. And then I thought: “Whoa, this IS life-changing. Let me quit that inspiring yet stressful job, ditch the long commute, and teach other people how to get in on this magic.”
We have a beautiful, talkative young daughter and a cat with a human name. The cat is named Caitlin. She came with that name. It is confusing to my friends who are named Caitlin, and oddly I have many human friends named Caitlin/Kaitlin.
I’ve always wanted to make the world a better place. The causes I care most about are social justice and environmental sustainability. Whether it was consulting for international development in Washington, DC, designing executive leadership programs at the Wharton School, or heading up Summer Search Philadelphia to help build resilience in young people, I’ve always wanted to do work that makes our world better.
Chile is home-away-from-home for us, and we speak Spanish at home. I met my husband in Chile while doing an internship at an astronomical observatory in undergrad. Years later, I lived there for 2 years and did a bilingual MBA. My very first class was Accounting. In Spanish. (I don’t recommend that.)
My company is named Indigo Organizing thanks to Isaac Newton, oh and a few others things. Read more about that here.
We’ve lived in the Philly area for over ten years. If you haven’t been, you must come. I’ll walk you around. We’ll go to Deals in Media and buy pens. #introvertpastimes
I LOVE what I do. Whether it’s teaching, speaking, talking with the press about how to simplify, or working 1:1 with my clients, it’s a total HONOR to help people to live their best lives.
Are YOU ready?"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/about-konmari,"About The KonMari Method®
The KonMari Method® was developed by Marie Kondo, Japanese organizational guru and best-selling author of The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Her method became so popular (a six month waiting list for her services in Japan!) that she decided to take her phenomenon world-wide.
In 2016, she began training KonMari consultants outside of Japan for the first time ever, and I was thrilled to be a member of the inaugural class in New York in August 2016.
What’s so special about KonMari? Well, lemme tell ya!:
We commit to getting it done. I work with my clients to choose a ""graduation date"". This helps to keep the momentum going, especially when the going gets tough.
We go by category, not by room. There are five categories: Clothing, Books, Paper, Komono (miscellaneous), and Sentimental. So, you have a road map. No guesswork.
We decide what sparks joy. You’ll get SO good at knowing the difference between what sparks joy and what sparks ""meh"".
We de-clutter FIRST and buy organizing products LATER, if at all. You won’t make the rookie mistake of buying a bunch of bins and baskets to organize things you don’t even want or need. Because, you, my friend, are NOT a rookie.

https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/2017/5/10/sentimental-reflections-on-spain,"I'm not a person who takes a lot of pictures. And if I do, they either end up in a shoe box or in my online Dropbox folder, never to be seen again. I think that's why I love the KonMari philosophy of tidying sentimental items in your home. It's not about holding on to every little thing that reminds you of a time that sparked joy. It's about really savoring those moments, while they are actually happening.
It's been a few months since I've been back from Spain and I have to confess that I've been procrastinating on writing this blog post. If I don't take a lot of pictures, how can I tell the story? Then it dawned on me that this must be why I love Spain so much. I have very few pictures of my times there, but my memories are vivid and completely etched into my mind.
So in today's world that seems to ask us to document and post EVERYTHING in photos, how can we step back and actually BE in the moment and savor that moment?? I love how best-selling author Gretchen Rubin teaches us to squeeze every ounce of happiness out of special moments:
I really made sure to follow this model as I prepared for Spain, as I experienced it, and now as I reflect on it. The way that I experienced Spain is the way that I hope to experience this summer...
Essentially: Walk, Sit, Talk, Watch, Repeat.
Most of my days in Spain were spent walking through the city or on the beach, sitting in plazas, talking, laughing with dear friends, people-watching and stealing quiet moments to read in parks. So, as I think about those beautiful ten days, I can still feel the breeze throught the trees and hear the sound of the Mediterranean waves, and I plan to savor those memories for years to come.
I may not be a big picture-taker, but it just doesn't seem right not to share a few of those moments with you.
Happy savoring. Happy summer."
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/2017/7/27/yes-you-can-buy-time,"The New York Times just published an article about how ""buying time"" (aka outsourcing or delegating) can increase your happiness level. Whether it's ordering take-out on a stressful weeknight or paying someone to clean your house, outsourcing specific tasks in your life can significantly reduce burnout and increase happiness.
So why don't we do it more? The researchers have a hunch: ""a Protestant work ethic that values being busy or guilt over paying someone for a task that people could easily do ... 'We want to seem like we have it all together and we might be therefore resistant to spending money on time-saving purchases even when we can afford it.'""
Sound familiar?
In my work, I meet so many people working hard to ""do it all"". When you are in a state of overwhelm, there is only one thing to do: SIMPLIFY. One of the best tools to help you do this is the 4Ds, pioneered by legendary professional organizer Julie Morgenstern in her book Time Management from the Inside Out. Here’s how it works:
Diminish - This one is my favorite! How can you do something faster? Or, what’s the “minimum effective dose?”
Don't clean the whole house. Set a timer for 20 minutes and do your best impression of a Tazmanian Devil as you whiz around straightening up and wiping down.
Love hosting but don't have the time? Host monthly ""come as you are"" dinners, where your guests (and you!) might even be in sweatpants and enjoy take-out or grill some food. (Great tip from my fellow KonMari buddy Patty Morrissey.)
Defer - Can you do this later?
Look for open pockets of time on your calendar in the next week and schedule things that are important but not necessarily urgent, like finally making that vet appointment or renewing your passport.
Delegate - Can someone else (or someTHING else) do this for you?
I LOVE delegating my grocery shopping to Peapod. Every time that happy green truck pulls up and plops my groceries right on my kitchen floor, the joy sparks fly.
Get a robot vacuum!
On your to-do list, note items that a spouse or partner can do. My husband knows he’s in trouble when I get out the purple Sharpie...
Delete - Do you even need to do this at all?
Hate sending holiday cards? Don’t send them. That's all.
Got an invitation to a party that you don’t want to attend? Send your regrets. That's all.
That’s it! Keep the 4Ds in mind when you are faced with too many tasks and not enough time. They can help you quickly focus on what is the highest priority, so that you have time to spend on what’s truly important."
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/2018/1/31/how-to-buy-less,"One of the questions my clients often ask is: ""After I've cleared out so much clutter, how do I make sure that I don't just go out and buy a bunch of stuff again?"" I love this question because it really gets to the heart of why this work is so important.
Starting in the 80s, with the arrival of cheap imported goods, Americans began consuming at an unprecedented level. Because we could, we filled our home with fast fashion, clever gadgets and, yes, lots of boxes and bins to try to corral it all. In the end, the average American household ended up with an average of 300,000 items in it. The thing is, we DO NOT NEED ALL THIS STUFF.
Clearing your space of things that you don't need is incredibly important, but it's not always easy. It means several major behavior changes:
First, you take on the life-changing task of removing ALL of the items in your home that don't spark joy.
Then, you develop new daily habits to make sure that those joy-sparking items have a home, and that they always find their way back to that home.
And finally, you maintain a VERY high bar of what new things are allowed to make their way into your home.
So, how can we train ourselves to buy less? There are two ways.
KEEP A SHOPPING LIST
Use an app like Evernote or Wunderlist to keep a list of items that you truly need, so that when you are out shopping, you are ONLY looking for those items. When I help my clients de-clutter their closets, we often end up with a short list of items, like white tees, black leggings or black flats. Know what you need.
HAVE A HIGH BAR
My favorite resource comes from Sarah Von Bargen, an online financial coach and teacher. She has a fantastic wallet-sized card that you can put right in front of your credit card. It asks us to question our purchases BEFORE we buy them, with questions like:
* If I had to wait in line for 30 minutes to buy this item, would I?
* Before looking at the price tag, what would I be willing to pay?
* Am I going to tear this open the second I get home because I am so excited to use it?
(That first question alone saved me recently when I found myself in line at Home Goods with a lilac candle. I put it back, and walked out of the store.)
You can download the wallet card, which comes with a great workbook, here. Print it out, and let me know the next time YOU put something down and walk away. Your home and your sanity will thank you."
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/2018/3/22/howtogetdressed,"My clients often ask me: ""Do you wear the same thing every day?""
The answer is .... Sort of.
I don't necessarily wear the EXACT SAME THING EVERY DAY, but yes, I have about 4-5 outfits that I wear ALL THE TIME.
Why do I do that?
We make 35,000 decisions a day. That drains us. As a business owner, mom and CFO and COO (and housekeeper and launderer ...) of our household, I've got A LOT TO DO. So the last thing I want to waste my energy on is figuring out what the heck to wear.
So, my general formula is:
I wear mostly black, dark blue, white and gray.
I usually wear black leggings with a tunic-style shirt. (My fave leggings are here: Athleta - pricey but worth it - and Old Navy - inexpensive, so you can buy several).
I try to buy higher quality items so that they last longer and wash better.
I choose things can be dressed up or dressed down.
It has to be comfortable.
I have to feel great in it. (Like, you-might-run-into-your-celebrity-crush great)
No ironing!
And that's about it. There's no magic formula. There's no exact number of items. There are no rules.
Ok, so now you may be thinking. Sounds great, Amanda. All puppies and butterflies. But how the heck do I get to that point??
pare it down
Kondo It - The first fundamental step is to make sure EVERYTHING in your closet sparks joy. You can get this done in less than 5 hours, with a friend (or me!), and a glass of wine. Check out my step-by-step blog post here.
Edit often - Sometimes I'll catch a non-joy-sparking offender in my closet and ask myself ""How the heck did you survive in here this long?"" Toss it in a basket in your closet, and when the basket is full, donate it.
Keep a shopping list - I use Wunderlist to keep a running list of things I need. I do NOT wander aimlessly through the mall. Right now, I need a black camisole and black crew socks. That's it.
THE BOTTOM LINE
Channel your inner Steve Jobs (black tee and jeans!), make one less decision, and kick your morning off right."
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/2018/3/7/letting-go-of-gifts,"When helping my clients to simplify their homes, we inevitably find a treasure trove of gifts that have been given to them that do NOT spark joy. You name it - candles, soaps, scarves, trinkets, souvenirs, the works. You can probably think of the ones in your home right now.
We feel an obligation to hold on to these items, even though we don't find them beautiful or useful, for fear of offending the giver. The thing is, they are weighing us down.
I help people let go not just of the item itself, but of the guilt that may come along with it.
Here's how the conversation typically goes:
Client: ""Ugh, so this is a scarf that my daughter gave me a few years ago for Christmas.""
Me: ""Does it spark joy?""
Client: ""Damn. I knew you were going to ask me that. I really don't like it, but I'm afraid she'll ask me about it if I let it go.""
Me: ""The act of giving sparks joy in the moment. It's the person's way of telling you that they care about you. Once the act of giving is over, if the gift doesn't spark joy, then you can feel free to let it go and let it spark joy for someone else.""
Client: ""But what if she asks me about it?""
Me: ""You say: 'Hannah, you remember how I am doing this KonMari process to simplify my home and my life? You know, I'm identifying everything that sparks joy? Well, I just wanted to tell you something. You spark a ton of joy for me. I love you. That scarf you gave me last year for Christmas does not. I let it go. [Wait for laughter and possibly a spontaneous hug of forgiveness.] And I want you to know that if I ever give you anything that doesn't spark joy, you can let it go as well.""
Client: ""Ooooh, that sounds good. Will you write it down for me?""
Me: ""I'll write a blog about it and send it to you.""
Remember, simplifying and de-cluttering your life means having a ruthless focus on what truly sparks joy, so that you have the time and space to focus on what really matters. It's the gift-GIVERS in your life that matter, not the gifts themselves.
Happy simplifying, friends.
PS - If you need a little laugh, check out this hilarious Saturday Night Live skit about the oh-so-frequent gift: the candle. :)"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/2018/5/15/do-something-badly,"I heard a phrase the other day on my favorite podcast that felt like it was sent down from heaven: ""Do something badly.""
""What the heck does that mean?"", you might say ...
It means that you should give yourself total permission to do ""that thing"" that you always want to do but that you never do because you're afraid you'll be bad at it. So, do it anyway. Badly.
It means that you don't have to be good at yoga. You can do it badly.
It means that you don't have to be a great cook. You can do it badly.
It means that you don't have to meditate as if you were the second coming of Deepak Chopra. Do it badly.
It means that you don't have to stress about the fact that you haven't written a blog post in two months because you just can't think of the perfect thing to say. (Ahem). You can do it badly.
Giving ourselves permission to do something badly means that we can get off of the hamster wheel of feeling like we have to be perfect at everything.
Life is not a Pinterest competition. There is so much beauty in imperfection.
Do tell ... what are YOU going to do badly this week?"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/2018/6/19/camping-with-a-k,"Last weekend was a gorgeous camping weekend!
We've been camping in the pop-up for 2 years now, and this year I finally feel like I am getting good at simplifying things. This helps SO much, because when you bring too much stuff, it's WAY more work and WAY more schlepping.
I'm now doing what I call ""camping with a K"", aka Camping the KonMari way.
Below are my top tips, and if you scroll all the way done, you can find photos as well!
I pack everything in categories - Clothing, Linen, Food and Komono (miscelleneous). So, I pack at home in that order, then I unpack at the campsite in that order, and then vice versa. It prevents me from ""zig zag"" packing (""what the heck am I doing right now?!?"") and keeps me focused on one thing at a time.
I use clear Sterilite bins from Target for each category.
I use colored duct tape and an Extreme Sharpie to label the bins. I label each side of the bin. This way, no matter which way the bins get packed into the car, I still know where everything is.
I use one gray packing cube for each of us. #wearthesamethingallweekend #itscampingafterall
This time, I got extra fancy and re-purposed some plastic containers to make a DIY Shake 'n Pour pancake mix and a smaller container for milk to fit in the cooler.
Similar to my beloved #backpackchallenge, this helps cut down on the work of travelling and adds lots of time to #donothing.
Tell me how you simplify YOUR travel this summer!"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/2018/6/19/camping-with-a-k-ptjpa,"Last year, I published a blog post on how I pack for camping. Now that it’s camping season again (yay!), I’m bringing this oldie-but-goody back.

https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/2018/6/30/me-and-ray-lamontagne-do-the-dishes,"I can't do the dishes without Ray. Ray LaMontagne, that is.
You see, when I look at that messy pile of what-just-happened in my kitchen, my first thought is ""ugh"". My second thought is ""Ray"".
I ask myself, is this a ""2-song mess"" or a ""3-song mess""? Then I get to work. ""OK Google - Play Ray LaMontagne"".
(If you've gotten this far, and don't know who Ray LaMontagne is, stop right now and listen to this song. You're welcome.)
So often, I feel downright annoyed by the drudgery of daily life.
Wake up. Make the bed. Make the breakfasts. Pack the lunches. Pack the homework. Wash the dishes. Fold the laundry. Clean the floors. Run the errands. Pick up at school. Fold more laundry. Wash more dishes. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.
Let's be honest. It can be BORING. Especially when there are so many other more thrilling things to do. Like read articles about life hacks. Or read The Invention of Wings. Or watch The Handmaid's Tale. Or sleep. Oh, glorious sleep. (Can you tell I'm an introvert?!)
The thing is, when I think about it, usually that thing I need to do will take me no longer than two songs do it. Three songs, max.
So, I roll up my sleeves, tell my husband that I need some alone time with Ray, and then we (me and Ray) do the dishes. (Don't worry - it'll be my husband's turn to do the dishes next.)
After about three songs, the dishes are done, I'm humming my favorite songs, and I'm off to read my book, or watch my show, or cuddle with my daughter, or sleep. Oh. Glorious. Sleep.
Next time you're faced with a little drudgery, invite somebody to do the dishes with you.
Just not Ray.
He's taken."
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/2018/9/10/what-its-like-to-work-with-a-konmari-consultant,"Working with a KonMari consultant is a LOT like working with a personal trainer.
You hire a personal trainer because you want to get fit and strong, so that you can feel your best and live your best life.
You hire a KonMari consultant because you want your home to be peaceful and beautiful, so that you can feel your best and live your best life.
It’s hard work, but there is exciting and measurable progress along the way, and you feel better and lighter even after the first session.
In short, I provide the expertise, the accountability and the momentum. You show up and commit to doing the work.
Here’s how it all plays out.
Step One: We chat on the phone
Before deciding to work together, we chat on the phone for 15-30 minutes and I pepper you with questions.
What’s your life like now? What do you want it to be like? What’s causing you pain? What would you focus on in your life if your house was tidy? How much do you want to do this? What’s been stopping you? How does the family feel about this?
This conversation helps us figure out if we are a good fit and if you’re ready to dive in.
Step Two: We choose a package
One of the hardest parts of the job is figuring out how long it will take. This totally depends on a few things: your speed in making decisions, how much stuff you have and how much “homework” you can take on between sessions. The typical American home can take between 50 and 200 hours to complete! Knowing this, clients choose from the following packages:
15 hours (Three 5-hour sessions) - You live in a small 1BR or 2BR apartment.
30 hours (Six 5-hour sessions) - You live in a medium to large home and you want me there to help you start each of the 5 categories, and you’re going to do LOTS of homework in between.
50 hours (Ten 5-hour sessions) - You want to go deep into the work and you might have less time for homework in between .
If clients wrap-up the project sooner than anticipated (which almost never happens!), they have a full year to use remaining sessions. (You can see more detail about the packages here.)
Step Three: I show up on the first day.
You’re feeling nervous and excited. You’ve kicked your family out of the house. You’ve put the phone on silent. You’re wishing you had cleaned up a little, but I’m glad you didn’t! (It helps to see things in their natural state.)
You give me a tour of the house for about 20 minutes, we take some “before” pictures, and then we dive right into the first KonMari category: Clothing.
We are going to pile EVERY PIECE OF CLOTHING THAT YOU OWN onto the bed, and one by one, you are going to choose those items that “spark joy” and gratefully say goodbye to those that don’t. You say: Right now? I say, Yes, right now.
After five hours of hard work and a few protein bars, you are exhausted but proud.
I whisk away your donated items (or help you to schedule a pick-up) and then I send you a link to your own personalized online KonMari journal, where you’ll be able to see all of your progress, and most importantly, the homework you’ll need to complete before the next session.
You take “after” photos and text them to your friends to brag. #myclosetsparksjoy
Step Four: We continue through all of the categories
On Day One, we picked a KonMari “graduation day”, so over the next few weeks or months, we will continue to work towards that date by tackling the next four KonMari categories: Books, Papers, Komono and Sentimental.
You may choose to do entire categories on your own as homework, or you might do bits of pieces of each category.
Along the way, you might discover that you need some repairs or some help around the house. I’ve got you covered. I can recommend everything from my favorite house-cleaning service to painters to handymen.
Step Five: Enjoy your home that sparks joy.
You’ve worked hard and now you are reaping the rewards. Your house is bright, open and spacious. It is filled with only things that spark joy. When people come over, you insist that they look at your closet.
And over the next few months and years, you fine tune. You edit more.
In your new space, you discover new possibilities. You are living a more “spark joy” life.
Ahhhhhhh. Sounds nice, right?"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/5-tips-for-a-holiday-season-with-less-stress-and-more-joy,"I love the holidays as much as the next person, but I get a little worried when I start seeing that familiar ol' frenzy kicking in.
We're already stretched thin in our day-to-day lives. Toss in an ongoing pandemic, flu season and THEN cooking, shopping, decorating, wrapping, a small (or large) dose of family drama, and it's a recipe for a total meltdown.
So, this year, I'm taking a beat. I'm sharing with you the 5 things I'm going to do this holiday season to have less stress and more joy. Let's get those holiday ideas started!
1. Schedule in some happy holidays fun.
Before you start making plans for the holidays, start by making a list of all the things you WANT to do this holiday season. If you could do ONLY the things you love, what would that be? For me, it would be:
Decorating the tree with holiday music playing and a fire going in the fireplace
Putting the garland on the staircase and a wreath on the door with battery-powered lights
Visiting our local light displays and getting hot chocolate or apple cider
Making peanut butter blossom cookies
Eating lots of comfort food (but not necessarily being the one to cook it)
2. Make a list of the things you DON'T want to do.
I had a client confess to me recently that she hates the holidays and she spends the entire season just waiting for December 26 to come. On top of parenting and her full-time job, she cooks, cleans, does all of the gift shopping and wrapping and is even charged with making great-grandma's lasagna - with noodles made from SCRATCH. By the end of the season, she's tapped out and resentful.
Now, I may not have gotten myself into a lasagna-noodles-from-scratch type situation, but I have found myself doing things in the past that felt like a holiday ""should"" and not a holiday ""want.""
That included:
Getting a natural tree even though I hated the expense, the pine needles everywhere and the watering
Putting out a bunch of outside lights that ended up looking a little funky
Sending paper holiday cards
Going to holiday parties that I didn't really want to go to
Cooking holiday foods
Buying way too many gifts for people
So, guess what? Those things you hate doing? Ahem. You don't. have. to. do. them. Full stop. Will some people be disappointed? Maybe. Will they get over it? Yup.
3. Find the minimum effective dose.
I love this phrase minimum effective dose from Dr. Christine Carter's book The Sweet Spot. It's all about figuring out how to find that ""good enough"" sweet spot.
Here are some examples.
Don't like to send holiday cards? Text your closest, far-away friends and ask them if they can do a FaceTime or Zoom call in pajamas over the holidays.
Don't want to decorate your whole yard? Put a wreath on the front door and call it a day.
Tired of all the shopping? Make an agreement with the family that everybody will chose one adult from a hat and all kids have a gift limit of $25.
4. Outsource like heck.
The holidays are a great time to lean on other available resources to get things done. You can only do so much! Think about ways that you let other people, or other tools, do the work for you:
Order battery-powered lights like these for the front door wreath so that it goes on and off at a certain time.
Shop local stores who offer gift wrapping (like Monkey Fish Toys in West Chester, PA) or request gift sacks with your Amazon purchases.
Let the pros do the cooking and order a Thanksgiving dinner to go. Here's an exhaustive list of places like Whole Foods and Bob Evans who will do all the cooking for you. Plus, check out offer from local restaurants.
Schedule a special one-time cleaning of your house before guests arrive.
5. Sketch out a little holiday planner.
Either on a paper or online calendar, sketch out a plan for the holidays.
Add the fun first. Schedule in those things you said you wanted to do. Try Googling ""fun things to do for the holidays near me"" or ""fun holidays for kids near me"" to find cool things going on near you that you might not have tried before.
Add in your travel schedule. Decide which days you'll travel (if this applies) and think of ways to make the travel plan more fun. Cool pit stops? Fun snack mix? Books on tape with holiday stories?
Plan a vacation day. Decide on a day (or two) when you'll take a nice, long break. Sleep in late. Stay in pajamas.
Let the kids eat cereal all day. Maybe even book a local hotel with an indoor pool.
So, that's my plan, folks! I'm going to try to take my own advice this year and create a holiday with less stress and more joy.
What about you? What you are YOU going to let go of this year? What can you outsource? What fun can you add?"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/a-step-by-step-guide-to-4d-ing-your-holidays,"Don’t panic! It’s just the holidays.
I’m here to help you map out a season with less stress and more joy. And I’ve even got a handy worksheet to help.
One of my absolute favorite tools to teach is the 4Ds, and the holidays are the perfect time to teach it. The 4Ds were pioneered by legendary professional organizer Julie Morgenstern in her book Time Management from the Inside Out, and they are MAGIC.
We’re going to use the 4Ds to break down your holiday season so that you can amp up the joy and bring down the stress.
Here’s how!
Step One: Know the Ds
What are the 4Ds, you ask? They are Delete, Diminish, Defer and Delegate.
1. Delete, aka Don’t Do It at All
When in doubt, Delete. Ask yourself “Do I even need to do this at all?”
Examples:
Hate sending holiday cards? Don’t send them. That's all.
Got an invitation to a party that you don’t want to attend? Send your regrets. That's all.
Limit gifts. In our family, we don’t exchange gifts between adult family members this year, AND we're setting a $25 limit for each kid.""
2. Diminish, aka Do It Smaller
This one is my favorite! This challenges us to figure out how we can do something quicker, smarter, easier. It asks the question, “What is the minimum effective dose?”
Examples:
“We don’t need to decorate the entire house for the holidays. Let’s a wreath on the front door and a simple tree.”
""I'm not going to cook for hours for the whole family. I'm going to have a good ol' fashioned pot luck and only cook one dish.""
3. Defer, aka Do It Later
Ask yourself, “Can this wait?”
Examples:
""I'm not going to stress about sending holiday cards in December. I'm going to do New Years cards, or better yet, Valentine's Day cards.""
4. Delegate, aka Let Someone (or Something) Do It
Take a good list at your to-dos, and strategize where you can bring in some reinforcements. Are there other people, services or machines that can shoulder some of the work?
Examples:
If you decided to Delete gifts between adults, take that money and invest it in a pre-holiday cleaning.
Have groceries delivered.
Order pre-baked pies or side dishes.
Step Two: List out all of your holiday to-dos and activities
Ok, now that you get the idea of the 4Ds, you’re going to jot down ALL of the things you’ve got on your list for the holidays. Write it all down, including things you need to do and things you like to do.
If you want a head start, print out this worksheet I created to help! Pre-populated with lots of holiday activities, it lets you choose what sparks joy and then strategize who to 4D the rest. There's even room to add your own ideas.
Jot down things like:
Shop for presents
Wrap presents
Pick out a tree
Decorate the house
Send holiday cards
Step Three: Add some joy.
Make sure you write down things that you don’t necessarily already do, but that you would LIKE to do. Things like:
Take the train into the city and see the lights
Go caroling
Try making mulled wine
Do a holiday movie marathon
Step Four: Do the joy test.
For each item on your list, decide if sparks joy. Are you super excited about it? Is it your favorite part of the season? Or do you dread it? Does it feel like a chore?
If it sparks joy, awesome! Proceed full speed ahead!
If it DOESN’T spark joy, think about how you can apply the 4Ds. Can you Diminish, Defer, Delegate or Delete it? Make a note next to that item about how exactly you’ll apply one (or more!) of the 4Ds.
Be creative and be willing to make a change.
You’re ALMOST done! Now comment below and tell me what you are going to 4D. I love to hear what you’re up to!
Happy holidays, friend."
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/adamgrant,"It was so much fun to open Marie Kondo's March newsletter to find that one of my favorite people - Marie Kondo - had just interviewed another one of my favorite people: Adam Grant! (Make sure to read the interview here.)
I met Adam when I worked at the Wharton School, and he had just arrived as a fresh face on campus. All it took was seeing him speak once to know that he would go on to be one of today's most exciting influencers. In fact, his book Originals (which he discusses in this excellent TED talk) helped me make the shift from my exciting career to an even more exciting chapter as a KonMari consultant helping people to simplify their lives.
Adam urges us to ""doubt the default"". This has connections to the work of tidying in so many interesting ways. In today's society, we are often overwhelmed with commitments, obligations, and yes, way too much stuff. Adam Grant and Marie Kondo remind us to doubt the default when they ask us to re-examine what is important to us in our lives and to consciously choose belongings, people and career paths that ""spark joy.""
I can't wait to read Adam's next book, Option B, which he co-wrote with Sheryl Sandberg and will be launched in April 2017."

Being tired is especially problematic when we want our homes to be tidy, but after a long day of parenting or commuting or care-giving, we can't muster up the energy to spend even 5 minutes getting things back to where they should be."

Here’s how I did it:
I picked one color palette. I’m already kind of a minimalist dresser, so this one wasn’t too hard. In the summer I wear mostly navy, white and gray, with the occasional pop of color. That way,"

Me too, friend. 🙋♀️ Me too.
Don't worry. I've got you.
I've compiled some of my favorite last-minute gift ideas, right here. This one is going to short and sweet because time is a tickin', and those holiday wish lists aren't going to take care of themselves."
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/do-a-toy-detox,"So … let me start with a shocking statistic, just to get you in the holiday mood.
Yeah, I know. It’s terrifying. At one point, I think 40% of the world’s toys were living under my daughter’s bed.
This month, if you’ve got kids, you’re likely going to have an influx of new gifts and toys, so it’s the perfect time to learn how to help kids wade through the toys and create space for what sparks joy.
Either before the new toys come, or after the holiday dust has settled, consider implementing some of the tips below to decrease the clutter and increase the joy.
Help them identify what they truly love. Ask your child “Does this spark joy?” or “What are your favorite toys”? Kids actually really understand the concept of “spark joy” (sometimes more than adults!). Introducing this question into the toy conversation will help them start to distinguish between the things that they truly love and the things that always end up at the bottom on the toy bin.
Create a Wish List. Every time your child asks for a toy, say “Sure, honey. I’ll add it to your wish list.” Then, add it to a Wish List that you’ve created, ideally in a notes app so that it’s always on hand. They will feel like their desire has been validated and “recorded”. They won’t actually remember 90% of the things that they’ve asked for, but some things may come up again and again. So that’s your “hot list” for the next birthday or holiday.
Institute a “one in, three out” rule. For every new toy they ask for, tell them they will need to let go of THREE. This is especially helpful if your child has way too many toys but has a hard time letting go of things. If the new toy is something they really want, they will often quickly be able to identify three things to let go. This also curtails splurge purchases at the store. Sometimes, I ask my daughter to just name the three toys that she’ll let go of. Then, we can buy the new item and collect the items to donate when we get home.
Show them where their donations go. My husband works at a community center, so we often donate my daughter’s toys to the daycare center there. When she’s having a hard time letting go of something, we’ll tell her that the babies at the center really need a ball pit or shopping cart or sandbox and tell her that if she gives it to them, we’ll send her a picture of them using it. She loves seeing the little babies using her old things!
Prioritize “non-fixed” toys. In this article I wrote for Motherly, I talk about the importance of non-fixed toys, or toys that awaken a child’s imagination, versus fixed toys that typically do only one thing and don’t spark much creativity (or keep them busy while you’re trying to cook dinner!). Try keeping these non-fixed toys out and consider rotating out the fixed toys, so that they can eventually be forgotten and let go off.
Consider instituting “fun money.” This is a little different than an allowance in our household. Each week, our daughter has $10 to spend. It can be on ice cream, visiting a play place, a piece of candy, or a toy. If she doesn’t spend it, it carries over. So when she asks for something, I can say “let me check your fun money”, which lives in a separate pocket of my wallet. If she has the fun money, she can usually get the item. If not, she can’t. It takes the focus away from “my mean mommy who won’t let me have it” to a more neutral place of “oh well, I don’t have enough money.”
Teaching your kids to choose toys wisely and to treasure the toys they have is not something that happens over night. But you can slowly change the conversation, put some boundaries up and help them curate a collection of toys that spark joy for them and that minimizes clutter for you.
So, maybe, just maybe, next year our sweet little American kids will own only 39% of the world’s toys. #goals"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/dont-get-mad-get-specific,"When I work with my clients, we’re usually focusing on two things. One, we’re doing a massive de-cluttering and organization of what they own. Two, we’re working to instill new habits so that they can continue to enjoy their newly simplified life.
One snag people hit is trying to communicate with others about doing their share in the household. We often get frustrated that people just don’t do what we want them to do. We say things like:
“I wish my spouse would help out more.”
“I wish my kids would clean up after themselves.”
Sometimes, the problem isn’t the other person. The problem is that we’re not being specific enough about what we actually want or need.
Statements like “clean up your room” are not concrete. They don’t give clues about what your actual expectations are. They don’t give the other person an easy action plan.
Case in point: I once asked my husband to clean the windows on the interior of our house. He looked at me as if I had just asked him to clean the Sistine Chapel.
I could telI was going to have to break this down.
I got out the Windex and microfiber cloths. I handed them to him and said, “Can you clean the windows in the kitchen and the living room, and then, if you’re in the mood, in the bedrooms upstairs? It should take about 15 minutes.”
He took the bait, ahem, the tools, and 15 minutes later, I had clean windows.
Give it a try and see how it works. Try these little shifts to make your requests more clear and concrete:
This can even work with more touchy interpersonal stuff.
Give your inner martyr a little Spring Break, and give it a try.
Remember, be specific. Painfully specific. And see what happens …

https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/find-the-minimum-effective-dose,"I’m jazzed about a super practical and actionable article in the New York Times this week. It has videos for how to do 3 full-body workouts - and each of them is only SIX minutes long.
Now THAT’s my kinda workout.
I know what you might be thinking:
Six minutes isn’t enough to see real change, or
Six minutes? I feel like I can’t even get six SECONDS to myself. (Oh, I FEEL you.)
But this article is the perfect example of the “minimum effective dose”. I love this phrase, which I first discovered in Dr. Christine Carter’s book, The Sweet Spot.
The idea is to find the minimum effective dose for EVERYTHING.
Don’t have 2 hours to go to the gym and back? Prop up your iPad and do a SIX-minute full-body workout.
Been wanting to meditate but you want to do it “right?” Download the Calm app and do the Daily Calm - it’s only 10 minutes!
Been procrastinating on sending a tricky email? Set a timer for 15 minutes and get it done.
Feeling schlubby? (technical term) Slap on some perfume and lipstick.
Kids are antsy and you can’t get out to a playground? Have them do laps around the house for 15 minutes with silly music.
This little concept packs a powerful punch. Once you start practicing it, you’ll find a million ways to apply it.
And with THAT, I am going to end this blog here. See?! I’m stopping at the minimum effective dose.
PS - As always, I love to hear from you! Tell me how YOU will be applying the minimum effective dose!"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/get-a-one-way-ticket-out-of-should-land,"If you’ve been following me for a while, you’ve heard me talk about “fun & easy.” Here’s the basic premise:
When we spend too much time doing things that: a) we hate doing, or b) we aren’t very good at, we expend a lot of energy that could be going to much better things. We are living in the Land of the Shoulds, the land where you are supposed to just suck it up, and the land where you bang your head against the wall a LOT of the time.
Get ready to ditch the “shoulds”
But what if we didn’t subscribe to that idea? What if we got a little bratty? What if we asked instead - what do I LOVE to do? And what am I actually pretty GOOD at? What if I spent MORE time on those things?
That’s what the ol’ “fun & easy” concept is all about. It’s about figuring out how to spend MORE time doing the things that really light us up and spending LESS time on the things that drag us down.
Brain dump your way to “fun and easy”
The tool I’m sharing today is going to give you a shortcut to finding YOUR fun and easy.
Here’s what you’re gonna do:
Head on over to this link to download your worksheet. (If you are new to Indigo Organizing, you’ll be added to my mailing list. If you’re already on it, don’t worry - you won’t be added twice! Just fill in your email and it will take you to the download.)
Brain-dump all of the pesky tasks and projects that you’ve got on your mind. This might be something as simple as “unload the dishwasher” to something bigger like “renovate the kitchen”. (There are categories so that you can divide these into 4 areas: Work, Home, Self and Others.)
You’re going to ask yourself a simple question: Is this fun & easy? Go with your gut. Do you love doing it? Is it fun? Are you really good at it?
If it’s NOT fun and easy, think about how you can downsize it, using Julie Morgenstern’s brilliant 4Ds.
Diminish - What is the minimum effective dose? (You might decide that you can just get the kitchen cabinets painted vs. gutting the whole kitchen.)
Delegate - Is there a person, service, app or machine that could do this? (You might decide to ask your teenager to take over dishwasher duty.)
Defer - Can this wait? (You might decide that now is not the time for any major renovations.)
Delete - Do I need to do this at all? (You might decide that you like hand-washing dishes instead! It’s weird - but that’s what I do!)
Make some notes, like “Delegate to Sammy”. Make sure the notes section spells out the EXACT action you are going to take, like “Call contractor to cancel estimate.”
For the things that ARE fun & easy, get crackin’ on those! Make time in your calendar or to-do list to GET IT DONE.
Observe “fun & easy” in the wild
Here are a few examples of my own examples:
Work: I LOVE giving talks, but I DON’T like planning events. So, I just talk at OTHER people’s events. They plan the event. I show up and talk. That’s Delegate (letting someone else to plan their event).
Home: The interior of our house needs to be painted. DIY-ing it would be so NOT “fun & easy”, so I was ready to hire a pro. I was getting estimates, etc. but then I realized I’m just not up for this project right now, so I’ll revisit it again next spring. That’s Delegate (to a pro) and Defer (to next spring).
Self: My nails look like they belong to a 12-year-old boy. I used to try to paint them myself. I hated it and they looked terrible. Then I tried getting them done. I hated it, and they never lasted. Now I just keep them unpainted, short and neat. That’s Delete (no more painting nails).
Others: Most of my friends have little ones at home so it’s hard to have long phone conversations or Zoom calls. Instead, we send each other voice memos on Voxer or Whats App. That’s Diminish (we find a the minimum effective dose to connect).
Give me the details!
Sooo, tell me, tell me, tell me! What did you learn? What got the boot? What didn’t? What’s gonna change? I’m all ears, so tell me in the comments below.
Don’t forget to download your worksheet right here! Here’s a few hot tips:

https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/how-to-consign,"When we de-clutter our lives, we are often faced with figuring out how to give our items a second life.
For high-quality, gently-used clothes, consignment can be a great way to let them spark joy for someone else, while also giving you a little cash back for those investment pieces that you still need.
How much cash back exactly?
Think about the rule of thirds. If you’ve purchase something for $99, the consignor will usually sell it for a third of that, or $33. You’ll get roughly a third of what they sell it for, or $11.
If you have lots of high-quality clothes to consign, this can add up. If you only have a few items, it may not be worth your time.
Since consigning your items can be time-consuming and consignment shops are usually very choosy, it’s important to know your options and choose wisely.
There are many options, either online or in physical stores. Regardless of the option you choose, it’s important to note the following:
Clothes should be clean and free of stains, pilling, or tears.
Clothes should be from a name-brand and usually they must be 2-5 years old.
Online Options
ThredUp
ThredUp will send you a clean-out bag that you can fill and send in at your convenience. When thinking about what items are sellable, they suggest that you ask yourself the question: “Would you give this to your best friend?” They accept only about 40% of items that are sent in. They will donate the items that are not chosen for consignment.
Poshmark
With Poshmark, you snap a few quick photos of your items and then post them for sale online. You’ll get bids and offers, and then ship the items directly to the buyers. It’s important that the item be name-brand and in excellent condition.
The RealReal
The RealReal is for your highest-end luxury items. Think items priced at hundreds of dollars. They offer several options for how to get your items to them.
In-Store Options
Greene Street
Greene Street has several locations. They will review your items quickly (usually in less than 10 minutes), tell you which items were accepted, and then you’ll receive a check in about 90 days. It’s important to note that they must accept at least 10 items at a time. So, if you go, make sure you go with a bagful, and not one or two items.
Clothes Mentor
Different from Greene Street, Clothes Mentor will take much longer to review your items and they’ll give you cash on the spot. They give priority to those stay in-store while their items are being reviewed, but even then, it can take an hour or more. They do not have a minimum number of items that they must accept.
Independently-owned consignment shops
There are many independently-owned consignment stores available. They often have more flexible requirements and a more personable experience. Magic Threads Consignment in Media, PA is owned by personal stylist Catriona Whitehead, so she brings the best of her clients’ fashion right to you.
As you can see there are many options for finding a second life for your clothes. Just make sure that you review the guidelines carefully before beginning."

I was recently featured in a Vox article about ways to declutter your digital life. Whether you're trying to figure out how to organize your phone or how to clean out your Gmail inbox, the Vox article is chock-full of super PRACTICAL strategies. You can find the full article here - Easy ways to organize your digital life, from photos to emails.
Below are some highlights from the article, including my favorite ways to jump start your digital decluttering and get your digital life under control, fast. Consider this your digital declutter checklist.
1. Figure out the actual problem.
Often, we make our digital clutter problem bigger than it is. Before you start desperately Googling how to organize your life, it's helpful to take a step back and ask if it's really ALL of the digital stuff that is stressing you out. Or is it just one or two areas, like photos and files? Hone in on what needs the most attention/what's stressing you out the most and start THERE.
2. Start small.
Don't try to build out a big, complicated folder architecture for your electronic documents. Just start with a few simple folders, like Medical Records, School, or Cars. Put files into those folders and add more folders/structure as needed. Consider using a service like Dropbox. It's affordable and easy to use, and your files will be backed up to the cloud. Dropbox even has something called Dropbox Vault, where you can store more sensitive documents under an extra layer of security.
3. Use a naming convention.
From the Vox.com article: ""If you have issues finding documents in Google Drive or Dropbox, try sprucing up the way you title your documents, Jefferson says. She likes to start with the date (for example, YEAR.MONTH.DAY) then a few words about the file. Say you’re saving copies of your kids’ report cards; you might use your child’s name and the semester or marking period in the name of the document. "" This naming convention makes it so much easier to find and organize digital files!
4. Learn how to use the ""labels"" in Gmail.
Labels in Gmail are just folders with a fancy name. Get in the habit of labeling emails and then archiving them. This will remove them from your inbox, but they'll stay saved under that label for good.
From the article: ""When it comes to email organization, Jefferson suggests creating folders, tabs, or labels if you use Gmail to categorize messages. 'I have a folder for online orders and a folder for my daughter and a folder for certain work projects,' she says. You can move or archive the emails to these specific folders and they’ll be out of your main inbox. It’s important to note that archiving does not delete emails, they’re just moved to another place, so archiving won’t free up any storage space.""
Consider fancier apps to clean up email like Superhuman. The $30/month price tag is a bit steep, but I gotta say, I whiz through my emails at lightning speed with this program. (If you love keyboard shortcuts, you'll love Superhuman. For example, just typing ""L"" allows you to label an email in one step.) It almost makes my email declutter FUN. Almost.
5. Don't be afraid to ""go nuclear"" and archive.
If you're still stuck on how to clean out your Gmail inbox, don't be afraid to archive. Create one big label/folder called Archive and toss all of your emails in there. If you REALLY need something, you can search for it there later. But it won't be cluttering your inbox in the meantime.
6. Use the cool features already available in your photo apps.
Instead of pulling your hair out as you're purging photos or dealing with a mess of cluttered pictures, try using some of the sophisticated features of many photo apps, like facial recognition and date/time stamps. These features are amazing if you're trying to pull together many pictures of the same person or photos from a specific trip.
From the article: ""Because technology on photo libraries has gotten so advanced, you may not even need to do a ton of categorizing, says JR Raphael, the author of the column and newsletter Android Intelligence. Google and Apple Photos allow users to search their images by date, item, and person. 'You can look for practically any characteristic you could think of that would describe an image or images you want to find,' he says. “Words like ‘wedding,’ ‘Halloween,’ ‘canoeing,’ ‘beach,’ color, red, green, purple, or specific text that appears somewhere in the image. So the organization of [photos] becomes superfluous and unnecessary.'”
Here's how you can do that with the photos on your iPhone and here's how Google Photos can even search by people, friends or places, including pets!
My podcast co-host Brooke loves Slidebox to easily organize photos on your phone, and I love Chatbooks to easily turn those favorite photos into photo books.
7. Clear out your phone
No digital cleaning would be complete without cleaning up your phone. If you're wondering how to declutter your phone, my advice is to get ruthless. Here's a great article on how to dump unused apps fast, including by using Apple's Offload Unused Apps feature.
So that's it, my friends! With these seven tips, you can get your digital declutter under control. By taking the time to organize your digital life, you can free up some MAJOR time and mental space for more important things.
Happy digital decluttering!"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/how-to-give-your-items-a-second-life,"Have you ever felt amazing after a day of de-cluttering, only to realize that you have NO idea what to do with all the things that you’re ready to let go of? Should I donate this? Does this have value? Should I have a garage sale? Should I consign? Can I recycle? Where?
Never fear! I’ve got some resources to help.
There are many excellent organizations right in our community that can make use of items that you no longer need.
For example, did you know that …
Many animal shelters need your old sheets and towels?
You can recycle old electronics while supporting job creation?
Your professional clothes can help women get back into the workforce?
There’s something called the “Free Store” right in Media?
My website houses a list of some of my favorite organizations where you can donate your items. It also includes a link to the brand new Discarding Guide by KonMari, and there is even information about how to consign and sell things that may have significant value.
Always be sure to visit their respective websites to learn more about drop-off locations, hours and each organization's wish list. These organizations are often volunteer-run, so their hours and needs change frequently.
So, thank those items for the years of service that they have given you, and send them on their new journey with pride!"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/how-to-shop-smart-on-black-friday,"This isn't typical for me ... but I'm getting a leeetle bit excited for Black Friday.
I've got a few favorite companies and products that I've got my eye on. I wanna know what great deals they've got cookin' for the season. And luckily, it feels like the days of people getting in line for Black Friday and waking up at the crack of dawn are mostly gone. (Anyone remember the Cabbage Patch Kid frenzy??) These days, you don't have to shop for Black Friday deals in person. You can shop, mostly from home, in your comfy jammies. (Except for giving love to your local small businesses!)
Here are my top 5 Black Friday tips for how to shop smart during this day/week/month of great sales:
1. Keep an eye on your favorite brands now.
So where's the best place to Black Friday shop? Wherever you buy the things you love! I'm signing up NOW to get emails from my favorite brands, especially ones that are a little pricier. That way, I'll be sure to get all the Black Friday secret deals that might not be broadly publicized on their website.
Here are some of my favorites that I'm keeping an eye on: (These are not ads - just brands I love!)
Billie - Their razors with the magnet holder for the shower is game-changin'. I also love the dry shampoo (available in a darker shade for darker hair) and the lip balms.
Thrive Causemetics - Thrive is one of my go-tos for makeup products. Their products are cruelty-free, 100% vegan and formulated without parabens, sulfates or latex. I love their Buildable Blur CC Cream and Creaseless Concealer
Prose - I just tried this customized shampoo & conditioner. It's on the pricey side, so I hoped I wouldn't love it ... but alas, I do.
Kizik - Have you heard me brag ad nauseam about my absolute favorite hands-free sneaker that you can put on and take off with just a step? I get compliments on my Women's Athens Bahama style all.the.time.
2. Create a wish list for yourself and others
You might've noticed that a lot of those I listed above 👆 seem like they are for, well, me. 😜They are! I use Black Friday not only as a chance to cross some things off my holiday list but to stock up on items that I've been hoping to upgrade or purchase for some time.
So if you don't actually BUY the items yourself, you might think about using Black Friday as an opportunity to tell those little birdies in your life what you have your eye on. If you're wondering ""What should I buy for Black Friday?,"" think about things you might have wanted to purchase or upgrade for a while. Things like:
New Pyrex storage containers to replace the mismatched mess you've currently got in your Tupperware drawer
That Dyson stick vacuum that's been calling your name
Your favorite makeup brand that rarely has sales
And when you're ready to plan out your gifts for others, the Balance Bound collection just came out with a great gift planner where you can easily plan gifts for everyone on your list, not just for the holidays, but year-round.
3. Ask yourself if you REALLY need or want it.
Before you just google ""Amazon Black Friday deals"" and start frantically adding things to your cart that look like a good deal, take the time to think about if this is something that you or a loved one REALLY needs in their life.
It's not a ""great deal"" if you don't really need it. People might rightly ask ""does Black Friday really save you money?"" and the answer is NO if you buy a bunch of stuff you don't need.
4. Shop small and local.
Use Small Business Saturday as an opportunity to stroll the downtown of your favorite nearby town and show some love to local small businesses. They will often gift wrap on-site. Make a day of it - add lunch, coffee, bring a friend. Oooh, maybe even add in a foot massage.
Lots of towns will publish special events happening all weekend to entice shoppers, like free parking and special treats. For example, here is what my beloved town of Media, PA is doing. I just Googled ""small business saturday media pa"". Do the same for your town!
5. Do your future self a favor.
Use Black Friday to sign up for courses, memberships or other things that you might not do NOW but might do later. For example, I'm launching a huge promotion with lots of bonuses for my Organized Every Day course. For many people, this will be a ""favor to their future self."" They'll likely tuck it away until January and start the New Year off with a bang. (Join the waitlist here and be the first to know about this big sale!)
So that's it my friends! I hope you enjoyed these Black Friday shopping tips.
I'd love to hear from you about YOU! What type of Black Friday shopper are you? What deals are you grabbing?"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/is-it-fun-and-easy,"About a year ago, I started asking myself a question that gave me dramatically more clarity (and joy!) in my work and life.
The question was:
Is it fun and easy?
Why did I start asking this question?
Because I was overwhelmed by the ""shoulds.""
I have ALWAYS have been overwhelmed by those blasted shoulds, but I felt particularly overwhelmed as a new entrepreneur. Suddenly, I, alone, had to dictate how I would spend my precious time.
Being an entrepreneur can be incredibly freeing. But, there's also no road map. No clear strategy. No ""right"" answers.
After a year of trying to do all of the ""shoulds,"" I signed up for Tiffany Han's 31 Days to Flow course. I had learned about ""flow"" previously in my career, and I was intrigued about how I could apply it in this new phase.
Essentially, ""flow"" is a state where you feel totally in the zone. You don't notice the time passing. You feel energized. You feel like you're excelling at what you are doing or you're seriously enjoying the process.
(Doesn't that sound better than ""should""??)
Tiffany asked us to spend almost two weeks identifying our core values. I was somewhat dismayed at this request since I had spent countless hours (days!) in my previous corporate and non-profit life identifying values. What?! Values?! But I signed up for flow!!
Alas, I love and trust Tiffany, and I had paid for the damn class already, so I obliged.
The results ended up being one of the most game-changing exercises I have ever done.
After much soul-searching, ranking, debating and word-smithing, I came up with a list of 5 (soon to be 6) values that would become my new compass for EVERYTHING that I do - not just in work, but in life.
My values are (in order of importance):
Honesty
Courage
Depth
Quiet
Laughter
Beauty
These six simple words unlocked new wisdom about what I seek in life - in others, in my work, in my parenting, and so much more.
I could bore you for hours on the significance of each of these. So let me save you from that and instead offer a few examples. ""Depth"" alone explained why certain friendships filled me up, while others depleted me. ""Quiet"" explained why I turn into a crazed person from those hysterical Snickers commercials if I don't have some quiet time in my day. ""Beauty"" came later, as an antidote to a world that often feels out-of-control.
Tiffany promised us that if we began to follow those things that aligned with our values, we would find more flow. More fun. More ease.
And so it was.
The question ""Is it fun and easy?"" became a shortcut to test if something ""checked off my value boxes.""
I made some significant changes as a result.
Speaking to groups is SUPER fun and easy for me, so I do that a lot more. What's NOT fun and easy is hosting events, so I don't do that.
Writing is fun and easy for me, but all the legwork of editing, posting, and scheduling it is NOT, so I hired a virtual assistant for that.
Instagram is fun & easy for me, so I invest time in posting there 2-3 times a week and connecting with others. Facebook is NOT. So I don't spend much time there at all.
Working one-on-one with clients is fun and easy. Scheduling and invoicing is NOT. So I use an online scheduler for that.
By following the path of ""fun and easy,"" I have found more flow, ease, and joy. I've accepted the radical notion that I can follow what energizes me.
I know what you're thinking. Not EVERYTHING can be fun and easy. So true, my friend. So true.
Luckily, for those things that aren't fun and easy, we can often eliminate them, delegate them, or find creative ways to make them just a bit more joyful.
I'm so excited to explore this concept more with you.
I may even have to launch a podcast about it.
Hmmm. Would that be fun and easy?!
Stay tuned, my friends. :)"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/journal,"It's Day Six in Spain and my mind is swirling with gratitude and joy for the wonderful experiences that I've had. I've walked the beach at Tossa de Mar, played soccer in seemingly every corner of Catalonia and even did a 12-hour organizing marathon at my dear friend's home. I've just spent three glorious hours reading in the grass at the Parque del Buen Retiro, surrounded by songbirds and daisies. The ""spark joy"" senses are on overload!
So now is the perfect moment to transition to our next stop on the journey: Paper. The one and only paper item that I've brought with me (well, in addition to my Moleskin notebook) is my Five Minute Journal. One year ago, I picked up this journal on a whim at a local bookstore, and I must say, it's been transformative.
Every morning, as soon as I wake up, I am greeted by a beautiful quote, followed by my prompts to answer the following questions:
What are your grateful for? (3 things)
What would make today great? (3 things)
Personal affirmation ... ""I am ... ""
Then at night, before my head hits the pillow, I answer:
What are three amazing things that happened today?
How could you have made today even better?
My favorite question is ""What would make today great?"". While in Barcelona, I asked my 7- and 10-year old hosts this question, and they answered: A walk, being together, playing on the beach, eating pizza and ice cream. We did all of those things. It was a perfect day.
I cannot overstate the positive benefits that I experience when I regularly incorporate this brief exercise into my daily routine. Based on proven research in positive psychology, this practice allows us to reap the enormous benefits of gratitude and intention.
Living a life of simplicity means taking the time to appreciate the simple things. With that, I'll leave you with a quote from the journal, page 165:
Now, on to appreciating my last day in Madrid ... !Hasta pronto!"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/lets-invite-one-another-in,"On a snowy Monday this month, in a nondescript building in West Philadelphia, my husband became a U.S. citizen. He was joined by 68 other people, representing 28 countries. We waved flags. He gave an oath. We took pictures.
Some people ask my husband: Why now?
My husband will answer some variation of this: Because we all want to contribute. We all want to be a part of something. Because it’s a beautiful thing to want to work towards the same goal of unity, love, acceptance and courage. Because the beauty and richness of the United States comes from the fact that it opened itself up to the world.
I know, I know. He’s kind of a deep guy. That’s why I like him. (If you want to hear more about how we met in Chile, you can read here.)
I listened to the book, captivated by her strong voice and her authentic story from childhood to today. Maybe it was because my own family was knee-deep in the the logistics and emotions of my husband’s citizenship process, but the book struck a chord with me, particularly the last lines:
And here is what I have to say, finally: Let’s invite one another in. Maybe then we can begin to fear less, to make fewer wrong assumptions, to let go of the biases and stereotypes that unnecessarily divide us. Maybe we can better embrace the ways we are the same. It’s not about being perfect. It’s not about where you get yourself in the end. There’s power in allowing yourself to be known and heard, in owning your unique story, in using your authentic voice. And there’s grace in being willing to know and hear others. This, for me, is how we become.
You see, these words also came to me at a time when Marie Kondo’s Netflix show burst onto the scene, creating a lot of excitement and curiosity. Since my passion today is all about helping people to find more joy via the KonMari Method, I was intrigued by all of the discussion.
Amidst the funny memes and online comments, one could, at times, identify a subtle undercurrent of fear, distrust or ridicule, and not necessarily of the method, but of Marie herself and where she comes from. It was as if some were saying, Who does this small, strange Japanese woman think that she is?
Luckily, an article appeared in the Huffington Post that dug deep on this question. In her article What White Western Audiences Don’t Understand about Marie Kondo’s Tidying Up, Margaret Dilloway explores why the show, and Marie herself, may have hit a nerve with some.
Of Japanese heritage herself, Dilloway helps us understand the concept of Shinto and how the KonMari Method is imbibed with the sacred practice of gratitude and wonder:
Kami are Shinto spirits present everywhere — in humans, in nature, even in inanimate objects. At an early age, I understood this to mean that all creations were miracles of a sort. I could consider a spatula used to cook my eggs with the wonder and mindful appreciation you’d afford a sculpture; someone had to invent it, many human hands and earthly resources helped get it to me, and now I use it every day.
Wow. This thinking is SO different. Starting in the 80s, we became bombarded by cheap goods produced overseas. We bought, and we bought, and we bought and we BOUGHT. We started to question less, and want more. We started to value less, and toss more. And with this new behavior, I worry we lost our sense of gratitude and wonder.
Dilloway goes on to say:
It’s cultural to imbue objects with a sort of dignity. Japanese culture, like any, is not monolithic, but the expectation to respect where you live and work — and therefore other people — is ingrained into many Japanese households that practice Shinto traditions. Treasuring what you have; treating the objects you own as not disposable, but valuable, no matter their actual monetary worth; and creating displays so you can value each individual object are all essentially Shinto ways of living. Even if you don’t have the space for shelves of books or can’t afford a dresser with enough drawers, make what you have work for you, instead of being unhappy that you don’t have more.
So, who DOES Marie Kondo think she is?
She is someone who wants to teach us about gratitude. She wants to re-connect us with the wonder and the joy of the world around us. She wants us to treat our homes as the sacred places that they are, that protect us from the elements and the chaotic world today.
Does she tap books to wake them up? Yes.
Does she believe it’s a crime to ball up your hard-working socks? Yes.
Does she urge you to empty your purse every day? Yes. (Ok, even I’m still not totally on board with THAT one.)
But she’s trying to teach us something. Just like my husband, she wants to contribute. She wants to share a different way of thinking. She wants to help bring simplicity and joy to our lives.
In the words of Michelle Obama, “there is grace in being willing to know and and hear others”.
Let’s invite each other in."
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/life-is-not-a-pinterest-competition,"People often say to me, “your house must be perfect.”
It’s not.
My friends and family can attest to that.
Sure, it’s my own little Petri dish and I have a lot of fun figuring out how to make it as organized as possible. I get to experiment and tinker in the hopes of a more streamlined and peaceful existence.
But it does NOT look like the cover of a Martha Stewart magazine. Or a model home for the Container Store. Or a recent HGTV makeover.
It is a real home, with 3 real-life, complicated humans living in it. And I make it a point to tell people this.
Because life is not a Pinterest competition.
You do not have to have a pantry with matching glass containers that are perfectly and elegantly storing every piece of cereal, every dry bean and every grain of couscous.
You do not have to have every damn LEGO drawer color-coordinated until the day you perish.
You do not have to roast the chicken perfectly and then cut the chicken and then serve the chicken, all while your adoring children sit quietly in their hand-sewn-by-you outfits.
Instead, you can choose to surround yourself with only those things that bring you joy.
And you can be completely unapologetic about that."
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/limit-your-inputs,"Happy New Year! I LOVE this time of year because it feels like a fresh, clean slate. BUT, I often fall into the trap of trying to do TOO much. Can you relate?
Ryan Holiday’s new book, Stillness is the Key, has a whole chapter dedicated to “limiting our inputs”. Holiday says, “it’s very difficult to think or act clearly (to say nothing of being happy) when we are drowning in information.”
Right?!?!
Never-ending news. Unlimited podcasts. SO MANY books. Endless emails, mail, and catalogs. Text chains galore.
Our brains were NOT designed for this.
So this year, I challenge you to limit your inputs. Think about consuming LESS information so that you can focus on what’s TRULY important.
Here are 3 tips to get you started.
Make it a habit to un-follow and unsubscribe.
Be a ruthless unsubscriber of email promotions and newsletters. (Hell, even this one, if it doesn’t float your boat!) Mel Robbins suggests an Un-follow Friday, where you un-follow all the feeds and “friends” that don’t spark joy.
Your email inbox, your social media feeds and your notifications should be filled with information that lifts you up, energizes you, inspires and educates you. Leave behind all the “shoulds” and the “maybe one days” and the “I wish I had thats”.
Get in and get out.
When it comes to news and social media, do a surgical strike.
Do you need to check a Facebook group? Great, go right there. Check it out, and get out. Do not linger on your Aunt Joan’s cat videos. Do not feel pangs of envy as you scroll through your neighbor’s profile featuring all-blonde children making kale chips in matching homemade outfits.
Want to get a news update? Great, access your favorite site, and read for 15-30 minutes. (When you start reading a story about a cat that got stuck in a giant snowball in Minnesota, your time is up.)
With books, go deep before you go wide.
Ok, this is my BIGGEST challenge. There are so many good books out there, and I could make it my full-time job to read them all. #dreams
But that’s just impossible.
So this year, I’m choosing a few “bibles”. Instead of reading every shiny new personal growth book, I’m going DEEP on the books that already made a significant impact on me in 2019. I’ll be ear-marking them, highlighting them, doing the exercises, and squeezing every last drop of wisdom out of them. (Spoiler alert: My #1 bible for 2020 is Atomic Habits. There is some real life-changing magic in this gem.)
Sooooo … will you give limiting your inputs a try! Send me an email and tell me how YOU are going to limit your inputs this year.
Because as Ryan Holidays says …
Wishing you a wonderful year of less noise and more joy, friends."
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/limiting-belief-i-should-be-able-to-do-it-alone,"When my clients come to me, it’s often because they are sick of spending their nights and weekends trying to “get organized”, only to have things fall apart weeks later.
They’re frustrated because they feel like they SHOULD be able to do it on their own. They say things like - How the hell does Lucy down the street with her 3 sticky kids have such an immaculate house? I USED to be organized, and then all of the other humans came into my life and everything fell apart. What am I doing wrong?
The thing is: It’s HARD to do it on your own, and it sure as hell isn’t any FUN to do it on your own.
I’m a freakin’ professional organizer myself and I often wish that *I* had a professional organizer to help me. Someone to laugh alongside me as I grapple with whether to let go of that CareBear t-shirt from 1983. Or someone to tell me to go get a granola bar when I’m about to pass out choosing which spatula sparks joy.
Why spend years telling yourself you SHOULD be able to do this on your own? Why not give yourself the gift of a calm, organized home where everything has its place now?
You CAN do this. You just need a little guidance. Most people do. And all you have to take the first step is to hop on a quick, free call with me. That first step will take you from feeling frustrated and overwhelmed to feeling like you have a PLAN that will WORK."
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/limiting-belief-my-clutter-is-embarrassing,"Have you even found yourself thinking that you’d love to have someone come in and help you de-clutter and organize BUT you’re a SMIDGE embarrassed to invite someone in? Maybe MORE than a smidge?
I get it! It’s hard to invite a stranger into your little world, especially if you’re not feeling super proud about your little world at the moment.
The thing is: Professional organizers do this work because they LOVE creating order out of chaos. As Marie Kondo famously exclaimed on her Netflix show: I love mess!
It’s not like we’re going to walk into your house and say to ourselves - What?! What the hell is up with all of this clutter?!
That’s why we are THERE! Because we know it’s driving you crazy, and we want to help. There’s no judgement, only loving (somewhat bossy) guidance as you peel back the layers and get the calm, organized home you really want.
Even my most gun-shy clients tell me that their fears and insecurities melted away during our first, free consultation call. They could tell right away that I wasn’t some judgy, perfect person who was going to shame them for not having a color-coded pantry. (Spoiler alert: *I* don’t even have a color-coded pantry.) During our call, they could tell that I’d BEEN THERE, and that I get so much JOY out of guiding my clients from a place of overwhelm to a place of calm.
You can take that first step without even letting me in the front door. All you have to do is hop on a free, 30-minute call with me. That one step can be the amazingly easy first step to a BIG positive change."
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/limiting-belief-organizers-are-only-for-rich-people,"When I tell people I’m a KonMari consultant and professional organizer, they often say “Wow, that’s amazing. When I win the lottery, I’m SO going to hire you.”
I LOVE that because I get to explain to them that, actually, MOST of my clients are what I lovingly call “solidly middle-class.” I do not spend my days in 600-sq-ft walk-in closets helping my clients rearrange their Manolo Blahniks. (Where are my Sex in the City fans?!) I spend my days in average, everyday 1/2/3 BR homes, helping my clients get to a place where Mom doesn’t feel like she’s about to have a nervous breakdown and the rest of the family discovers that they actually LIKE EACH OTHER when the house isn’t in total chaos.
These are people that know that the average middle-class household spends about $5000/year on home improvements. They know that, yes, they could get that new kitchen or that new bathroom or that new deck, but what they REALLY need is to get all of the STUFF out so that they can stop spending their days, nights and weekends just moving things around in an attempt to get some semblance of calm. They know it’s the most sanity-saving investments they can make, and BONUS … it doesn’t come with all the dust and workers traipsing in and out of your house.
And these smart middle-classers ALSO know that they are NOT going to do a bang-up job of it on their own. They’re BUSY doing a million other things, AND they’ve already been down that road, spending 4 hours on a Pinterest-worth craft caddy only to watch their 4-year-old bring it crashing to the ground while he role-plays Godzilla.
They need a guide, someone who can work with them during focused chunks of time, and who can, dare I say, actually make it a little fun.
I LOVE being that guide and watching my clients get in the zone. And the best part? You don’t have to win the lottery to get there. You can simply make it this year’s most important home improvement project and come out looking like the family hero.
If you want to know the 4 simple steps that I use to get my clients from chaos to calm, just click here and let’s chat."
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/make-a-summer-fun-list,"One of my favorite productivity experts, Laura Vanderkam, published her summer fun list this week, and it spurred me to create my own list. She encourages us to make time for “effortful” fun, ie things that require a little planning. That way, we don’t whittle the summertime away, wishing we had done more when Fall comes around.
I also wanted to view our summer fun list through the lens of saving money. Using Julie Morgenstern’s 4D approach, I thought about how we could “diminish” something, ie find the minimum effective dose. For example, should we pay $150 to see fireworks at Longwood Gardens or watch them for free at the local high school? Do we need to do the Phillies or would a minor league Blue Rocks game be just as fun?
So, here goes … my summer fun list!
Do a picnic at the awesome Havre de Grace Tydings Park playground. It’s only about an hour drive from us. Our daughter plays for hours on the top-of-the-line playground overlooking the marina, and then we can take a walk on the boardwalk and grab a bite at The Promenade Grill.
Watch an outdoor concert at Bellevue State Park. Bellevue is a hidden gem. Their outdoor concerts are a blast. Kids can run around and adults can lounge.
Make a solid fireworks plan. I LOVE fireworks, but for some reason, every year on the 4th I find myself scrambling to figure out where and how to watch them. This year, following Vanderkam’s advice, I put some effort into it. We’ll be camping in good ol’ Slower Lower Delaware that weekend, so we’re all set to watch the Lewes fireworks from the Cape May Ferry terminal.
Hit up a Member Night at the Philadelphia Zoo. These run from 6-8 pm, once a month, and they’re a great chance to explore the zoo with less crowds and less heat.
Walk on the beach. I may have grown up on the beaches of #slowerlower, but I’m not a beach lover. I just can’t deal with all the schlepping and the stickiness. BUT I do love a good WALK on the beach, especially before sunset. So I’ve gotta figure out a way to make that happen, likely without my lovely but impatient daughter in tow, saying “Moooooooooom, my legs are tiiiiiiiiiiired.”
Sit in a pool on a float.
Read a novel next to a campfire.
I’ve already done the work to schedule most of these things, so now I can just sit back and let the fun happen.
Happy summer everyone!"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/mama-im-like-kiki,"It’s going to be a short and sweet one this week because this month has been BONKERS! (I’m already 3 days behind schedule on posting, but who’s counting?)
If you follow me on Instagram, you’ve seen that the joy sparks have been flying up in New York City. I am now officially a KonMari instructor, training the next cohorts of aspiring KonMari consultants. I’m feeling some major ripple effects in motion, as these lovely people prepare to spread out across the world and help so many people create lives that spark joy. Check out all the action!
What I REALLY want to talk to you about today is Marie’s new book, Kiki & Jax, which was co-written and illustrated by one of my favorite children’s authors, Salina Yoon.
It dropped on my front step the day it came out, and it debuted in our household at bedtime that very night.
I am smitten. This book is SO DARN CUTE. It’s about a little squirrel who likes to collect and a little owl who likes to tidy. Together, they learn how to make room for the things that spark joy, especially their friendship.
My 7-year-old daughter is a bit of a packrat and has a LOT of attachment to her things, so I was really curious to see how she would react.
Well, my friends, the life-changing magic was practically instant. Here’s a little peek into her reaction at bedtime that first night.
“Mama! I’m like Kiki! I like to collect things.”
“Those boxes that they use to sort their things are SO cute. Could WE make cute boxes for donating?”
“I know it’s bedtime, but can I pleeeeease try this out on a few of my things?” (To which I replied “Um, YEAH! I’m up for a little late-night organizing session ANYTIME.” #introvertpastimes)
“Hmmm …. I’m not letting go of enough. This is harder than I thought…”
“I guess I don’t really need this. I think another kid might like it.”
Even tonight, when I FaceTimed her from the hotel, she immediately brought the phone up to her room and asked if we could do a little virtual session.
YESSSSS.
Even though I help people simplify for a living, sometimes our own family members are our toughest clients. I’m thrilled that she was finally able to understand these concepts in a language that meets her at her learning level.
I envision it being a great conversation starter for parents and kids around how we can make space for the things that we love so that our spaces, and our time together, can be more joyful.
Let me know if you pick up the book and what reactions you get in your household! I’d love to hear!"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/quick-wins-easy-decluttering-projects-for-the-post-holiday-lull,"We did it, friends! We made it through the holidays.
I don't know about you, but I'm pretty pooped! I'm relieved to have the wrapping, shopping, decorating, cooking, holiday cleaning and on and on ... behind me.
This is a GREAT time to do a little decluttering so that you can STOP looking at clutter and START wrapping up in some cozy blankets.
Here are 9 decluttering hacks that I recommend for quick wins with BIG impact.
1. Declutter closets
Decluttering closets is a great place to start. It doesn't have to be a big project like your bedroom closet. You could do the linen closet, the entryway closet, a small hall closet. Whatever could use a little love!
2. Revamp cluttered shelves
Are your shelves overflowing with books, pictures and knick knacks? Take everything off the shelf, really take a moment to look at each item and decide if it ""sparks joy"" for you. Check out these shelf styling tips by one of my fave designers, Emily Henderson, for inspiration.
3. Clear kitchen counters
Our kitchens are the workhouses of our homes, so decluttering kitchen counters is a one-way ticket to much more efficiency and ease in the kitchen. Take stock of what's living on your kitchen counter. Give everything a nice wipe down. Really ask yourself - does this NEED to be here? How often do I use this? Could I store it away in an easily-accessed location to free up more counter space and make the counter easier to clean?
4. Create an inviting social space
You might not be up for hosting so soon after the holidays, but do take some time to get ready for company at some point. In our house, we just re-arranged and decluttered our living room and now I'm itchin' for someone to knock on my door so that I can say ""come on in!"" We put games on our coffee table and set cozy blankets around. How can you make your spaces more inviting?
5. Make a decluttering list
If the above ideas don't strike your fancy, make a quick list of areas that are driving you nuts. List all of them! Think of a smaller project where you can get a quick win, like:
the condiments in your fridge
the junk drawer in your kitchen
your spices
toy bins
junk mail
Dump those ideas out of your head and onto paper. Then choose the first item you'll tackle and decide when. (Pssst - I'm hosting a Get Organized in 2023 Summit on Saturday, February 4th where you can de-clutter LIVE with me! See below for details!)
6. Gather your supplies
Here's your decluttering checklist so that you have everything you need for the project:
Contractor bags or strong trash bags if you're clearing out heavy things like clothes, coats or linens
Paper bags or cardboard boxes to carry away delivery items
Sharpies and painters tap or duck tape to label boxes and bags
Your favorite mug with water and/or coffee/tea to keep you hydrated and energized
A playlist if that will keep you going
7. Follow the rules
A few decluttering rules to keep in mind:
Don't leave those bag of donations in the corner for six months. (I see it all the time, my friend.)
Take a break when you need it. If you find yourself spiraling into decluttering despair, take five. Leave the room. Take a few deep breaths. Grab a snack and some water. You've got this.
If it's not a hell yes, it's a no. Be ruthless. Don't hold onto things that you don't truly love or that aren't truly useful. Imagine me there, glaring at you with a knowing look. Then put it in the donate bin.
8. Take before and after pictures
Make sure to take before and after pictures so you can show off your new, shiny, organized space to anyone who will listen!
9. Get extra motivation
And if you need some extra decluttering motivation, I've GOT you, friend. Add THIS to your decluttering calendar. 👇
On Saturday, February 4th from 10:00 am - 12:00 pm EST, I'm hosting a Get Organized in 2023 Summit where you can declutter LIVE with me. Think about it as your own special self-care declutter day where you'll get MAJOR motivation to purge clutter. I'll offer my best tips for getting organized in the new year, and then we'll get to work, with everyone working on an area they've identified. I'll even have special break-out rooms where you can ask me questions when you get stuck!
Click here to add your name to the waitlist and to save the date. Tickets will go live later this month and will only be available for a limited time. Keep your eyes out for early bird pricing!
Just imagine how AMAZING you will feel after you take some time to simplify your space.
See you soon, friend!"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/slow-down-to-do-more,"One of my mantras for 2019 is “Slow Down.”
I chose this mantra because I sometimes feel a nervous, frenetic energy like there is so much to do and not enough time. (Sound familiar?)
Luckily, I chose this work because I wanted to learn better tools to simplify my own life and to find more calm and ease while helping others to do the same.
That’s why I am excited that my new partner and friend Lindsay Satterfield was interviewed for a series in Authority Magazine and Thrive Global called “Slow Down to Do More.”
Lindsay is a productivity guru. I met her through a fellow KonMari consultant who had taken Lindsay’s classes and found her tools to be life-changing. (Marie Kondo doesn't have a monopoly on life-changing magic. :))
I started implementing Lindsay’s tools and ... WOW.
I am WAY more on top of things than ever.
Here’s what Lindsay has to say about our default mode today:
Do you want something different?
To learn how to “Slow Down to Do More,” brew yourself a nice cup of hot tea, settle in, and read this article with six clear steps for slowing down. (Marie Kondo makes an appearance in Step 4.)
To pique your curiosity, here’s a little teaser of those six steps:
Listen
Put yourself in a time out
Keep a “don’t do” list
Marie Kondo your schedule
Use a “simple joy” list
Breathe
In the coming months, I'll be partnering with Lindsay to bring her flagship Workflow Mastery to more organizations, so if you or your team is interested in learning about how to use her life-changing and practical strategies to stay on top of your goals, tasks (and email!), drop me a line!"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/spain,"The KonMari way of life encourages us to not only surround ourselves with things that spark joy, but also with experiences and people who bring us joy. There are few places on Earth that spark as much joy for me as Spain. I'll be making my next trip there next week, to celebrate my 40th birthday with a dear friend and to mark the start of my newfound life as an entrepreneur.
I'm excited to chronicle a bit of this journey with you, through the lens of ""sparking joy"". I'll be sharing my journey in true KonMari fashion with brief posts, category by category:
Clothing: Packing a functional capsule wardrobe
Books: Finding books that spark joy while traveling
Paper: The one paper item that I'll bring with me will be my Five Minute Journal. I can't wait to tell you all about it!
Komono (miscellaneous): Organizing travel komono using pouches; a special guest post about packing toiletries from certified KonMari consultant and frequent flyer, Christina Rosenbruch.
Sentimental: Traveling healthfully and frugally (yet richly!); Staying present
So let's get started!
Packing a functional capsule wardrobe
I have always been fascinated with the idea of a capsule wardrobe. (To learn more about capsule wardrobes, you can watch this Today Show video or visit the popular blog, Project 333.) While I don't currently use a capsule wardrobe in every day life, I LOVE the idea of trying to create a capsule wardrobe for traveling, because:
My checked luggage ALWAYS gets lost, so I want to travel with a carry-on only.
I need things that can quickly switch from day to evening (although admittedly my ""evenings"" in Spain are going to look a heck of a lot different than they did when I was 20 years old undergrad... )
I want to blend in and not stick out like a tourist. (Easier said than done!)
So ... what made the cut?! My capsule wardrobe will contain mostly gray, black and white items, with a few pops of color, and the items will definitely be comfortable for lots of walking and unpredictable spring weather. I had a lot of fun using the Stylebook app to create this gallery.
tops & dresses
Light and dark gray tunic sweater for cooler nights
Light gray sweater/blouse
Fushia tunic blouse
A crisp white button down blouse
Black-and-white nautical striped shirt
Off-white blouse
Long-sleeved black scoop neck shirt
Black cardigan
Black t-shirt dress
Gray t-shirt dress
BOTTOMS
Black leggings - great for the plane ride!
Black pants
Dark jeans
Lighter jeans
SHOES, ACCESSORIES AND OUTERWEAR:
Black leather slip-on sneakers - Great for going through security!
Black ankle boots
Black flats
Pearls for day and chandelier earrings for night
Patterned scarf - Found this at H&M in the perfect pattern and colors!
Gray rain jacket
Gray jacket
So there you have it! Stay tuned next time as we tackle Books! (I'd love your ideas on that one....)"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/sparking-joy-in-spain-books,"Since I was little, reading has been one of my favorite things to do. But with today's busy lives and a little one running around, I don't get to read as much as I would like. That's why when I made my list of things I wanted to do in Spain, reading was at the absolute top of the list. I am already daydreaming about reading in little cafes, outside in the park, on the train from Barcelona to Madrid, on the balcony of my little AirBnB in Madrid. I can feel the sparks of joy already!
To travel light, I'm going with my Kindle, so I'm planning to load it up with a few titles and then see what I'm in the mood for when I get there.
The List
Fates and Furies by Lauren Groff (I think I have started this book about five times ... I'm going to have to start over, AGAIN.)
Parenting without Power Struggles by Susan Stiffelman (I know, I know ... a parenting book on vacation?!? But trust me, this one is a must.)
I Know This Much Is True by Wally Lamb (I read this years ago, and it's probably my favorite book of all time. I'd love to re-read it.)
I was thinking of pulling a few ideas off of this list of ""life-changing"" books from Real Simple (you know I love anything that promises to be life-changing!), but I would love your ideas as well, via comments here on the blog or via Facebook, LinkedIn or Instagram.
What books are you bringing on your vacation?
What's your favorite book of all time?
I'm so excited for my next post about Paper, where I get to tell you all about one of my Top Ten Favorite Things of All Time: The Five Minute Journal.
!Hasta pronto!"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/spoken-from-a-true-konmari-client,"I am so excited to begin a new feature on my blog: interviews with my amazing clients!
I LOVE seeing how their lives transform during and after their KonMari journeys, and I’m bursting at the seams to share their stories with you.
Today, we’re hearing from Liss.
Liss lives in a quaint row home in Media, PA with her husband, two sons and their sweet blue-eyed dog. Over the course of six sessions, she worked SO hard to transform her home and, as she calls it, her lifestyle.
During our time together, I grew to admire her deeply. I’ve seen her kids really take to the process and her husband even got in on the action with his very own session. She also coined my favorite client quote of all time - “Guilt is not joy”.
We’re both a little sad that our official time together has come to an end. Luckily, she’s right here in my hometown, so it’s not really goodbye.
I asked Liss to share some thoughts about her journey, and her responses are below. #chills
-------------------------
The book refers to some life-changing magic. How has YOUR life changed?
I have a sense of ease in my life that I’ve never experienced before. My time at home feels calm and relaxed – it’s a true haven from the stressors of the world!
What has been the most rewarding part of this journey?
I know what brings me the most joy and love, and I confidently skip the rest. For anything that just can’t be skipped, I have systems for getting them done quickly and efficiently so I can get back to the good stuff. My things – both what I discarded and what I kept – taught me so much about myself, and I like what I learned.
What has been the most challenging part of this journey?
I struggled with the fact that certain areas of my home got worse before they got better. While I was completing clothes, books, and paper, sentimental items and komono would get pulled out of all their little hiding places in my closets and drawers, and then I had to find a place to pile them up until it was time to tidy those categories. I had boxes of miscellany in corners of my home and I hated it. I think I expected Pinterest-worthy spaces right away instead of respecting the process.
What has been most surprising about this journey?
I am amazed by how much less anxiety I have in general. Now that it’s gone, I’m surprised to look back and recognize how much anxiety I experienced on a daily basis. Now I know that the kids’ ballet uniforms are clean and in their bags. I know I’ve completed the permission slips and paid my bills. No more 3 AM worries! I’m still rather shocked by this.
Were any of the categories harder or easier than others?
Komono was very challenging, probably because it was vast! And out of Komono, my kitchen was the biggest project. It was an exhausting day, but it has also made one of the largest impacts on my life. It’s such a pleasant space now; we are cooking at home more and saving a lot of money that we used to spend on takeout because we just couldn’t deal with meal preparation.
How has daily life changed? (eg, getting ready, finding paperwork, quality time, etc.)
Almost everything about my daily rhythm has changed, but it’s most noticeable in the mornings. I barely have to look at what I’m choosing out of my closet and drawers – everything works together and everything looks and feels wonderful to wear. Even my jewelry is organized by color, so all I have to do is reach in the general direction of “blues”, “reds” or “metallics” and I know I’m going to end up with something that matches my outfit and makes me smile. I can’t make a bad choice! Another huge change is how much time I spend tidying and cleaning – it’s so much less! I do the 20/20/20 most evenings, but it usually takes me less than 20 minutes to tidy up. I don’t really tidy at all other than that; I’m just very consistent about putting things away as soon as I’m finished using them. On the weekends, the four of us in my family spend 30 minutes on cleaning, and we can finish the entire house: bathrooms, floors, counters, mirrors, and windows all get scrubbed/vacuumed/wiped in that time frame. Cleaning like that used to be a huge chore that I would tackle over several days, or (honestly) not at all. Now we do it together as a team, joyfully and quickly. Then we can enjoy our space and each other, go out into our community and play, and know we have a clean tidy home waiting for us.
What's the one piece of advice that you'd give to someone considering the KonMari Method?
I’d encourage you to make the commitment to yourself to get started right away, and to keep your intention on completing your tidying festival. A clear vision of *why* you are tidying, and *how* you want your life to look and feel afterwards will really help you stay motivated.
Do you fold your clothes KonMari-style? Is it a pain to keep up with?
I do! It is not time-consuming anymore. After a few months of folding this way, it became just as quick and easy as any other folding style.
I do the 20/20/20 six nights out of seven, as does my husband. Our kids join us 4-5 times per week. Usually it is really fun and there is a lot of enthusiasm. Sometimes they balk and it’s a drag.When the timer goes off and they stop, they are always happy with the results!
What's your new favorite spot in the house?
My bedroom. I used to love staying in hotels, mostly for their simple, clean, almost-empty rooms. I loved unpacking my suitcase and only having what I needed with me. So peaceful. I don’t have to go to a hotel to experience that anymore. My own bedroom at home is tidy and clean and the drawers have breathing room. The sheets and pillows are lovely and soft and the lighting is just right. I can truly relax and recharge in my room.
How has the family reacted to the new environment?
With gratitude! Throughout the process, all three of them gave me lots of words of praise and encouragement, because they felt the positive change right away. They’re especially appreciative of how easy it is to find their things and to put them away again. They’ve also noticed that I am not as grouchy as I used to be, and I am more available for fun. My sons LOVE doing their laundry, folding their clothes, and doing cleaning chores – I can see them taking pride in their work and how good it feels to know that they have important jobs to do. I feel very fortunate that I got immediate buy-in from my family. I give a lot of credit to “The Life-Changing Manga of Tidying Up.” My husband loved it and my 8-year-old has read it several times!
If you could do it all over again, is there anything that you would do differently?
I would try to be more gentle with myself. The KonMari Method is about tidying up our stuff, and our physical stuff is just the tip of the iceberg. Throughout my tidying festival, I found myself excavating through layers of personality, temperament, and memory. It’s intense! I got a bit impatient with myself a few times, but I learned to let myself feel my feelings and figure out what they were telling me. I’m so very glad I did this work. I feel as though my physical space is now a perfect reflection of my interior space: cozy, gracious, playful, and with my priorities aligned with my values.
Is there anything else that you'd like readers to know?
Hiring a Certified Professional Konmari Consultant is an investment, and it will pay dividends. I literally found money – cash and gift cards – throughout my home. I am saving money on groceries and takeout because I love cooking in my kitchen and getting creative. I don’t pay late fees anymore because my paperwork is organized. I hardly ever buy anything because I already have what I love and need, and when I do choose to buy something, I very intentionally buy the best I can afford, that is made sustainably, and won’t need to be replaced for a long time. And best of all, the personal well-being I feel is priceless.
What's next for you? What are you looking forward to?
Doing the tidying festival and spending time with Amanda was so much fun; I’m a little bit sad that this part of my journey is over. I’m looking forward to finding new ways to spend my time and money that spark maximum joy – I see a lot of travel in my future!

https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/stop-touching-your-face,"I’ve been talking a lot about habits lately, and today is no exception.
I’m going to ask you to try to break ONE habit that you probably don’t even know you do, A LOT.
....And that’s touching your face.
These are crazy times, and we’re all thinking about how to protect ourselves, our families and our communities.
You KNOW that you should be washing your hands, but did you know that it’s equally, if not MORE important to not touch your face?
Here’s my super un-scientific summary of the logic here, thanks to the New York Times.
Yes, we want to wash our hands because we want to keep the germs off. But the best line of defense is to make sure those germs don’t get a one-way ticket INTO our bodies.
Most germs get in through the “T zone”, our eyes, noses and mouths. And we don’t realize it, but those germy hands make contact with the T zone A LOT.
We rub our eyes, we scratch our nose, we rest our chin in our hands. And every time we do that, we’re giving those germies a free ride right in.
SO, will you join me in catching yourself in this habit? It’s HARD. (Since I started writing this, I think I’ve probably already touched my face 10 times.)
Read this article to learn WHY you shouldn’t touch your face and read this one for some tips on HOW to stop doing it so much.

https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/taking-konmari-to-work,"I love it when life comes full circle.
When I moved back to the States from Chile, I took a job at the prestigious Wharton School to create customized learning programs in their Executive Education division. I got to travel all over the world, working with amazing clients like the United Nations, the World Bank, and even the government of Shanghai. What I loved about this work was that it was PRACTICAL. We were giving people real-world knowledge that they could go back and apply to their work right away.
So it was a thrill to be interviewed by Knowledge@Wharton for a very practical piece on how we can bring KonMari into the workplace. Just like in the old Wharton days, it was fun to connect the dots on how we can use these principles to not just simplify our homes, but our workplaces and our careers.
Here’s just one example from the article about how managers can employ the “spark joy” concept:
“Tidying up also brings benefits at the organizational level. Managers can look for opportunities for team members to work on projects that spark joy, Jefferson said. “Let them stretch and shrink their jobs when possible. Maybe they love sales but hate writing proposals. Maybe they love the behind-the-scenes, but hate the schmoozing,” she said. “Think beyond the surface-level morale boosters like a staff lunch or an outing. Think about how you can help people re-engineer their jobs for more joy.”

This article is a great teaser for what’s to come. My work is expanding! I've joined forces with Lindsay Satterfield of Satterfield & Company, a productivity trainer and coach, to teach her popular productivity course, Workflow Mastery: The Disciplines of Accomplishment. I've been using her method to stay on top of my priorities, tasks and emails for months, and it's a GAME CHANGER.

https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/the-backpack-challenge,"Last summer, I got radical with my packing. I was sick and tired of dragging half of my earthly belongings with me on every trip, AND (back when we were still flying), I was sick of paying extra money for luggage.
SO, I challenged myself to pack EVERYTHING that I needed into one large-ish backpack. I even did this for a TEN-day trip to Florida.
Here’s how I did it:
I picked one color palette. I’m already kind of a minimalist dresser, so this one wasn’t too hard. In the summer I wear mostly navy, white and gray, with the occasional pop of color. That way, everything mixes and matches AND you don’t have to bring so many shoes. I ended up taking:
3-4 short-sleeved shirts/tank tops
1 summer dress
1 cardigan
2 pairs of shorts
1 pair of jeans
1 light jacket
1 pair of dangly earrings, 1 pair of stud earrings
1 pair of gold flip flops (these are my all-time favorites - pricier but totally worth it), one pair of taupe sandals and one pair of sneakers
2 bathing suits
2 pairs of light pajamas
1 cute fanny pack or cross-body purse
I wore my bulkiest stuff on the plane. I felt a little like Joey in that Friends episode when he wears all of Chandler’s clothes. I get chilly on airplanes anyway, so it made sense to wear my heavier clothes.
I picked things that could do double duty, like:
A dress that could also be a bathing suit cover-up
Sandals that were cute but also comfortable enough to walk in all day
A fanny pack that doubles as a cross-body bag and a wallet, with credit card slots, etc. (I found one just like this at a consignment shop for $12!)
My iPad so that I could read on the Kindle app and do some occasional work if I needed to
I used a 34-liter backpack with 2 main compartments so that I could pack clothes in the big part and then stuff that would normally go in a purse in the front one. Mine is a pretty inexpensive Coleman backpack that’s since been discontinued, but I’ve got my eye on this bag that avid backpack travelers rave about. (And right now, it’s 60% off!)
Each family member does their own backpack challenge. Help them pick easy outfits and make sure the bag isn’t too heavy for them to carry on their own.
This works best if:
It’s warm weather where you are going, since summer clothes are much smaller.
It’s a pretty casual trip that doesn’t involve lots of fancy occasions.
You have access to laundry, or you’re willing to bring along a small bottle of laundry soap to hand-wash things like bathing suits, bras and underwear.
You can get access to bulkier things like a hair dryer and beach towels at your destination.
You don’t mind wearing something a few times before washing it.
What I loved about it:
You’re hands-free. I sailed through that airport like a pro, and I didn’t have to bat my eyelashes at a stranger on the plane to get help hauling a monster carry-on into the overhead compartment
It’s easy to unpack. It was SO easy to unpack when I got to where I was going. I emptied the backpack so that it was ready for day trips. AND when I got back home, I wasn’t unpacking for days.
Your hotel room or rental stays really neat. The place we were staying didn’t feel overrun with our stuff. No messy suitcases all over the floor. We put our things in a few drawers, and then we had our backpack free for day trips.

https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/the-little-angel-that-could,"Sometimes, we’re surprised by what sparks joy.
In my living room, I have a glass cabinet where we keep wine glasses, fancier tea cups and some other little tschotskes. As you might imagine, I’m not a fan of tschotskes, but many of them were gifts or things I feel too guilty to get rid of.
I felt especially guilty because this little knick-knack haven was an affront to the advice that I give clients - to let go of what doesn’t spark joy. I even wrote a whole blog post on how to let go of gifts, for Pete’s sake.
So, I decided to tackle it and rid myself of this double-whopper of a guilt trap once and for all.
Among the knick-knacks was a little porcelain angel.
I took it in my hand and looked it over. I knew my grandmother had given it to me, but other than that, I didn’t remember much about it. It had my birth month and my birthstone. The little porcelain rose was chipped.
As I examined it, I asked myself all of the questions that I always ask my clients.
Does it spark joy? No, it sparked guilt.
Does it remind you of the qualities that you loved about your grandmother? No, it reminds me of a Hallmark store.
What are you feeling? A little nostalgia, but mostly guilt.
And then, I turned it over.
In her delicate handwriting, she had written:
A.H.J. 3-27-80 With Love, “ME”.
This was followed by a delicate drawing of leaves.
All of a sudden, this angel represented so much more. It was given to me on my third birthday. It had her handwriting. It showed the funny way that she always put “me” in quote. I could picture her shrugging her shoulders in self-deprecation, as she always did. It had one of her signature little drawings, which she added to letters, envelopes and her diary, to give every day things a little flourish.
And most importantly, it said “with love”.
My grandmother never liked to say “I love you”. She said she preferred to just show it. We would say “I love you”. And she would say “thank you.”
But here it was: “with love.”
And at once, I knew that, yes, this little knick-knack did carry special memories of my grandmother. It had just been living in the wrong place, forgotten and dusty.
So I rescued it from its sad home in tschotske purgatory and placed it on the top shelf of my bathroom vanity mirror.
And now, every morning, I get to remember summers on the farm. I remember picking blackberries and riding a bicycle-built-for-two with my sister around the huge tree at the center of my grandmother’s roundabout. I remember her watching and smiling from the swing, sometimes us giving a self-deprecating little shrug.
And THAT sparks joy."
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/the-push-i-needed-to-start-my-konmari-journey,"I’m an Obliger.
According to Gretchen Rubin’s Four Tendencies framework, that means I need external accountability to get practically anything done.
In fact, it took some major external accountability to complete my own KonMari journey.
Three years ago, I was a member of the first class of trainees to begin the KonMari certification in New York. And of course, as part of the certification, I was required to complete the KonMari process in my own home first.
Gulp.
Most people attending the training were KonMari devotees who had completed their journey long ago and were still raving about the benefits.
Not me. I was just an overwhelmed working mom who was looking to make a career change. My house was not joyful. It was cluttered and stressful, despite all my efforts to stay on top of things.
Thank God for that external accountability. I had three months to complete my journey and send my “after” photos. I tackled each of the five categories with a vengeance (Clothing, Books, Paper, Komono - miscellaneous, and Sentimental).
I sent my husband and daughter out for long outings on Saturdays. I tackled smaller categories during naptime. I hid under my covers hoping all of the paper would magically disappear. She did promise magic, right?
After three months of HARD work, I found my magic. The house was transformed. I felt lighter, dare I say, on top of things.
It’s hard to capture ALL of the changes that occurred. If I had to summarize, I would say it came down to three big changes: Overall Feel, Clothing, and Cleaning.
Overall Feel
I could find things. Oh, I could find things! No more running in circles, wasting precious time. (We spend an average of 55 minutes a day just looking for things!)
The things I loved started to “pop”. No longer buried, our favorite things suddenly had a more prominent place.
I could plop down on the couch after a long day and not look around in dismay. I could make myself a cup of tea and just relax.
We cooked more! No more old kitchen gadgets getting in the way. We had what we needed at our fingertips.
I started viewing EVERYTHING through the lens of “does it spark joy?”. Relationships, invitations, magazines, social media. EVERYTHING. I started saying no a LOT more often. (See my video on the KonMari website where I talk about JOMO - The Joy of Missing Out.)
Clothing
Clothing was a huge change.
I condensed my wardrobe down to one small closet. I was able to install some simple shelves in the other closet and turn it into a multi-functional space to store so many things that never had a good home in our small townhouse - wrapping paper, the printer and printer paper, office supplies, a small filing cabinet.
I began wearing a “uniform” of sorts and started investing in fewer, more high-quality clothes. I watched The True Cost documentary on Netflix, which dramatically changed the way I thought about clothing and waste.
Most importantly, I let go of how I “should” dress and focused on how I wanted to dress. After 20 years in the corporate world, my wardrobe had started to get a little bland. Black pants. Top. Necklace. Snoooooozefesssssst. I started playing around with colors and shapes and got a little groove back.
My husband also wanted in on the action! We did his clothing, and he felt liberated letting go of years of unloved and ill-fitting clothing. And, he decided that his fire-engine-red pants sparked major joy. (Though he’s still too shy to wear them out too often.)
Cleaning
And finally, cleaning. Cleaning became so much faster and easier. We were now able to get most of it done in little spurts during the week so that the weekends weren’t sucked up by cleaning sprees. (I can thank Clean Mama for those tips!)
Statistics say that by reducing clutter, we can reduce the time spent on household chores by 40%. I totally experienced that.
Less clothes to wash. Less stuff to dust and vacuum around an under. Less food waste because of easier cooking. Less. Less. Less. YESSSSS.
Final Thoughts
I share my story for two reasons:
Knowing ourselves and knowing what’s required to motivate us can be a game-changer when it comes to getting stuff done. If you haven’t already, take Gretchen Rubin’s Four Tendencies quiz to find out your own tendency. It may give you that needed kick-in-the-pants to get something done (like you own KonMari journey!).
It’s about finding YOUR version of joy. Life is not Pinterest. I want people to know that it’s not all puppy dogs and rainbows. I wasn’t born organized. Even today, my house does not look like the cover of Martha Stewart magazine. But it works for us. It’s OUR version of joy. And I want other people to find THEIR version of joy.
What would YOUR version of joy feel like?"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/the-story-of-indigo,"People often ask me how I came up with the name Indigo Organizing.
The answer is a bit long and windy. It spans many years, from childhood to today, and it means a great deal to me.
The name “Indigo” came about in three seemingly unconnected ways:
When I was a teenager, I was a bit of a science geek. So much so, that I majored in physics and astronomy in college and took an entire semester off to do a dream internship at an astronomical observatory in the Andes mountains of Chile. Thanks to being that lanky science geek, I know that, in the 1600s, Isaac Newtown identified ""indigo"" as one of the seven elemental colors. It represents a focus on what is necessary, what is elemental. A building block for seeing so much else.
Now for the second part … I have a husband with an eye for design. (He is another little treasure that I brought back with me from Chile.) He has lots of beautiful design books laying around. One day, as I was still brainstorming a name for my business, I opened up one of his books, and it immediately turned to a page describing what the color blue signifies. It said:
“The colour blue signifies relaxation, a successful result … trust … reliability, expansion, recovery, harmony, satisfaction, peace, stillness … endlessness, cleanliness, hope, solidity, intelligence, yearning [and] courage.""
UM, YES. That is exactly what I want all of my clients to experience.
The last one gets me a little choked up … My parents love birds and nature, and we spent much of my childhood camping and hiking. It is from THEM that I learned that there is a bird, called the indigo bunting, who migrates by night, to South America, guided by the stars.
And so, years ago, like an indigo bunting, I traveled to South America, guided by the stars.
And many years later, that husband from Chile with an eye for design helped me to make another dream a reality by designing a beautiful logo, with those amazing little indigo buntings nesting together.
And now today, guided by all that the word “indigo” means to me, I get to help others find more joy and simplicity in their homes and their lives.
Sniff. (I told you that it would be long and windy.)"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/tired-try-this,"Sometimes, we are just tired. We might be getting sick. We might have little ones who aren't sleeping through the night. We might have a major work project going on.
Whatever the reason, it’s frustrating to feel zapped of energy, especially when there is still so much to do. (Just ask that adorable, fuzzy koala.)
Being tired is especially problematic when we want our homes to be tidy, but after a long day of parenting or commuting or care-giving, we can't muster up the energy to spend even 5 minutes getting things back to where they should be.
Here are a few tips to help get you back on track. Think of this as an allergy test. Try a few of them. See which ones work. Toss the ones that don't.
Get Back to Basics
If you are tired, well, go to sleep.
Get back on a sleep routine that allows you to get the amount of sleep you need. Most of us need at least 7-8 hours nightly. Resist the urge to binge one more episode. Don't stare at that pesky blue light from your phone while in bed.
Give yourself a Do-Nothing Day. Permit yourself to do absolutely nothing. Be a couch sloth. Drift in and out of sleep. Be tired. (The ladies at Being Boss podcast and book coined the Do-Nothing Day. I tried it recently, and I'm hooked.)
Go for the Minimum Effective Dose
Give your body a break, and choose the path of least resistance.
Find a happy minimum. I posted on Instagram recently about Julie Morgenstern's Max/Mod/Min technique. When you're tired, you don't have to go all out. So the house is driving you crazy? You can't realistically make it all go away. How about settling for making the bed, clearing off the dining room table, and washing the dishes?
When faced with a long to-do list, choose only 3 Most Important Tasks to get done. Assign a time limit for each. Send that critical email - 15 minutes. Straighten up the house - 20 minutes. Return that voice mail - 10 minutes. Now you know that you can get your three Most Important Tasks done in just 45 minutes. Take a break between each task.
Try Some Jedi Mind Tricks
Once you've given your body a chance to recover, it's time to get some momentum.
Find your activation energy. Try Mel Robbins' 5-Second Rule. Imagine you are counting down a rocket to blast off. Count 5-4-3-2-1, and then get up. Do that thing you have to do. Don't think about it. Just do it.
Do it anyway. Another favorite trick of Mel's is ""Do It Anyway."" Don't want to send that email? Put a timer on for 10 minutes, and do it anyway. Don't want to wash the dishes? Do it anyway. As Gretchen Rubin often says, ""The stewing is worse than the doing."" Just get it done.
Try doing a task either reaaaaaallly slow or REALLY fast. The slowness gives you the grace to approach something with patience and attention, and the fastness provides you the energy you need to see results fast.
Make the task more enjoyable. One of my favorite blog posts is ""Me and Ray LaMontagne Do the Dishes."" Do I looooove doing dishes? No. Is it exponentially more enjoyable when I do them while being serenaded by a soulful singer-songwriter? Most definitely.
Say No
When you're tired, your number one priority is to get back on track, not being a social butterfly.
Remember Brene Brown's mantra, ""choose discomfort over resentment."" You don't have to accept every invitation. Just because someone throws you a ball, doesn't mean you have to catch it. Politely decline, put your PJs on early, and enjoy some quiet time.
Don't be afraid to offer an alternative. We often begrudgingly attend pointless meetings or coffee dates with people who want to ""pick our brains."" Instead of saying yes on auto-pilot, choose a less time-consuming route. Try, ""I'm not available for that meeting. Can you send me a voice memo with your specific question, and I'll get back to you by tomorrow?"" or ""I'd love to share my experiences with you, but unfortunately this is my busy season. I could do a 15-minute phone call next week on Wednesday morning.""
After 2-3 days of employing some of these techniques, you should be well on your way to your old chipper self.
Be gentle. You'll get there."
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/toiletries,"This week's blog is written by guest blogger Christina Rosenbruch. Christina is a friend, frequent traveler, certified KonMari Consultant and owner of Spark Joy Space.
Visiting a new place is an exciting opportunity to explore a different perspective on life. If you’re seeing a new place, it’s a chance to leave your comfort-zone. After planning your vacation, the challenge begins with deciding what to pack for your trip. Whether you’re checking your luggage or limiting yourself to just one carry-on, don’t stress! Instead, take advantage and consider this the perfect opportunity to “KonMari” your toiletries.
I’ve spent many years traveling, and I’ve determined that beyond carrying essential hygiene products, any additional toiletries I include depend on a few other factors. Start with the following considerations to determine what to take with you: Your trip length and destination’s season, climate and accommodations will drive your choices. The Ritz Hotel or a tent? With a close friend or family member or on your own?
Different Trips require Different Toiletries
Of course, different trips will have different requirements. If I’ll be wearing a backpack, I bring a multi-purpose product such as Pure-Castile soap which is a combination body wash and shampoo. I include bug spray and sunscreen. Badger and Bullfrog are two brands that offer combination sunscreen/anti-bug products.
If my itinerary includes social dinners, such as on a cruise, I’ll include cosmetics. Even in this instance, I suggest that you can still pare down and take only the products that “spark joy” for you. If you haven’t already, before you leave, do a bit of experimenting. Look at what you already have in new ways. You might find that the cream blush you love on your cheeks makes a great lip stain (or vice versa with your lipstick!)
Staying Within Your TSA Limits
If you’re traveling with only one carry-on bag, remember the United States TSA rules allow for only 1 quart-size plastic bag with 3.4 ounce bottles of liquids. Here are some tips for staying within the guidelines while still having what you need:
Many cosmetic companies offer convenient travel-sizes of their products. Google ""travel size"" and your favorite product to find it.
Putting small amounts of product into contact lens cases works great for concentrated liquids.
Maximize powder products. Lighter in weight and not subject to TSA rules about liquids, powder foundation like Zuzu Luxe is available in many shades and can be applied as lightly or as heavily as you prefer for a smooth matte finish that is not drying to the skin. (Remember to try any new products well in advance of your travels in case of a possible reaction.)
Consider taking along a few packets of powder laundry soap. It takes up little room, adds little weight and allows you to pack a bit lighter knowing you can wash some of your clothing on the road.
Pencils for lining eyes and lips also save space and weight.
One more pro tip: I place my quart-size liquids bag in a larger gallon-size bag and store them in an outside pocket of my suitcase. It allows for easy access in the security lines while also preventing them from possibly leaking onto my clothes.
In all situations, my goal is to bring the minimal amount, allowing me space in my luggage and more time to enjoy my new surroundings!
That’s it! I hope these tips help. Now get packing and safe travels!"

There’s a simple tool that can help with it. It’s called the 20/20/20, and here’s how it works.
Set a timer for 20 minutes for three separate chunks of time: Reset, Prep and Rest. Get the WHOLE family involved. This is a time for everyone to pitch in!
Chunk 1: Reset from the Day (20 minutes)
Take this time to reset and clean up from the day’s activities. This might include things like:
Putting folded laundry away
Washing the dishes and wiping the counters
Emptying lunchboxes
Putting dirty laundry aw
Taking paperwork out of backpacks
Putting bills in your “needs attention” folder
Putting toys away (Tip: I tell my daughter that I will donate whatever she doesn’t put away. #truestory)
Chunk 2: Prep for the Next Day (20 minutes)
Take this time to mitigate any snags the next day. You might do things like:
Pack lunches, or get the lunch supplies ready
Put out cereal bowls and cereal
Take out something to defrost for dinner tomorrow
Check the calendar and the weather
Put any important paperwork or supplies in backpacks and purses
ChuNk 3: Rest and/or Primp (20 minutes)
This is where everybody gets to reap the rewards. The kids have been a big help, so reward them.
Make yourself a cup of tea or pour a glass of wine
Take a hot shower
Do some relaxing skin care, like a face mask or exfoliating face wash
Give your nails some love
Let the kids play some video games or have a favorite treat
Do some reading
Surf Instagram
And that’s it! On paper, it may seem like a lot, but once you get moving, time flies. And, if you think about it, if you start at 7:00 pm, by 7:40 pm, you have a clean, clutter-free house and a steaming cup of tea in front of you.
Pro Tips:
Get the family involved. Decide who does what during the 20/20/20. Make lists and post them.
Make it fun. Put on music. Try to beat the timer.
Don’t overdue it. When the timer stops, you stop. You can do the rest tomorrow.

https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/what-about-clothes-that-dont-fit,"The number one question that I get is “What should I do with clothes that don’t fit?”
As my fellow KonMari consultant and wise friend Christina Rosenbruch says, the beauty of KonMari is that it brings us into the present. It’s about celebrating who we are TODAY and surrounding ourselves with what brings us joy TODAY.
So, what to do? Change the script.
I often say, “Our clothes are talking to us.”
Do you want a closet that says, “Good morning! I’m filled with things that you love and feel great in. Come on in. You can’t go wrong!”
Or, do you want a closet that says, “Ugh. Half of your clothes don’t even fit. Good luck finding something to wear today.”
Um, NO. That latter closet is totally rude, and it needs a new script.
Why do we need a new script?
Because our clothes set the tone for the day. They affect how quickly we get ready in the morning. They affect our mood and our confidence. They affect how physically comfortable we are. So, changing the script in your closet is a change that can provide amazing ripple effects, not just in your day, but in your career and relationships. Feeling like a million bucks changes everything.
So, do “joy checks” of ALL of your clothes, even the ones that don’t fit. (Check out my article here that walks you through how to tidy your clothes step-by-step.) This will give you the opportunity to identify those pieces that truly spark joy and that deserve a place in your home.
My clients often find that they don’t even like many of the ill-fitting clothes that they have, so there is no need to have them in your closet talking to you!
Choose to keep ONLY those ill-fitting clothes that you love, but then GET THEM THE HELL OUT OF YOUR CLOSET. Put them in a box with a cheeky label, like “ill-fitting clothes that I love” and then relegate them to the basement or other storage area, where they can’t be rude to you every day.
Welcome to your new morning conversation with your closet.

https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/what-are-your-colors,"Pre-PS - I’ve got an amazing new partnership going and I’ve got a special code for you today! Read on to learn more ….
----------
I’ve always been super fascinated that some people can wear certain colors, and others can’t. I’m sure you’ve said to yourself, “This does nothing for me”, or “I look so drab in this”. But how do we know exactly WHICH colors light us up and which drag us down?
A few years ago, I did some internet research and tested out the theories with a friend who clearly had a different complexion from me. We learned that I was “cool” and she was “warm”. A peach shirt made me look like a corpse. That same peach shirt made her look like a sun-kissed goddess.
But I always wanted to know more. What are ALL the colors that look great on me? And what are ALL the colors that don’t?? How can I stop wasting money on things that don’t work? Do I look good in black?? I certainly hoped so, since it was practically my uniform.
I also really wanted to help my clients figure it out. Sometimes, when we are doing their clothes, I hear from them, “Nothing sparks joy.” At the end of the day, I want all of my clients to feel amazing TODAY, not someday when they are where they “should” be.
So this is why I was STOKED when I discovered Jeannie Stith, aka the Color Guru, on Instagram (@yourcolorguru). Not only was her whole business helping people to identify their best colors, she was right around the corner in good ‘ol Wilmington, DE! (#homestate).
We wasted no time in meeting In Real Life. Over coffee and plate-sized chocolate chip cookies at Terrain, we quickly learned that we are kindred spirits.
So, this is where the rubber hits the road. Jeannie has already given me my own amazing color consultation, and I FINALLY know my colors!! Turns out that I am a Moonlit Winter. (How romantic, right?!?), and I now have beautiful laminated color cards (and digital files for my phone) for both clothing and make-up. She even identified five colors that are particularly special and unique to me. AMAZING.
All I had to do was fill out a short questionnaire and send her a few photos. Then we had a 25 minute video chat, and she sent me my cards - by email and snail mail.
Because I am so jazzed about helping my clients spark more joy. Jeannie is offering 10% off any of her color consultation packages if you use the code INDIGO.
I find her packages to be uber affordable, not to mention the fact that this knowledge will save you LOADS of money. No more buying things that don’t work.
Head on over to Jeannie’s site to check it and pick the package that works for you. And then, tell me ALL about it."
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/what-they-didnt-teach-you-about-friction-in-physics-class,"I am LOVING Atomic Habits by James Clear. Today, I am excited to share one big, fantastic nugget from the book - the idea of friction.
You remember friction from physics class, right?
If there's too much friction, that ball won't roll for very long. If there is little to none, that ball will keep rolling, and rolling, and rolling.
When it comes to having more ease and flow in our days, understanding the role of friction is KEY.
Here's how it works:
Do you want to make something easier? REDUCE friction. That is, ""decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits.""
Do you want to STOP doing something? ADD friction. That is, ""increase the number of steps between you and your bad habits.""
Reducing friction
Let's look at a few quick examples for how you might REDUCE friction to make things run more smoothly or to encourage a good habit:
putting your keys in the same place every day (to reduce the time getting out of the house)
putting bills on auto-pay (to reduce the influx of paper and stress of paying bills)
setting things on auto-delivery, like your toilet paper! (to reduce the mental load of re-stocking essential household items)
having groceries delivered (to avoid dragging three kids to the store)
putting your dish soap in a pump (to make a daily chore a little easier and faster)
getting a treadmill at home instead of going to the gym (to eliminate the extra time going back and forth)
enrolling in TSA Pre-Check (to decrease travel frustrations)
Adding friction
Now, some examples of ADDING friction to deter bad habits or behaviors:
deleting social media apps off of your phone (to decrease time on social media)
removing junk food from the pantry (to make eating junk food much harder)
wrapping your credit card with questions to ask before you buy something (to curb impulse buys at the store)
removing your phone or computer's auto-fill feature for your credit card (to add one more step to completing that next online purchase)
I am ALL about removing (and adding!) friction to create smoother routines, improve habits and meet those big goals.
What are some ways that YOU add or remove friction to make your days more efficient and easy?"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/whats-on-your-2019-bucket-list,"Last year on the Happier podcast, Gretchen Rubin and her sister, Liz Craft, introduced the awesome concept of “18 for 2018”. It’s a fun spin on the traditional New Year’s resolution.
Think of it like a bucket list for the year ahead.
Instead of putting all of your eggs in one basket with ONE BIG FAT PRESSURE-FILLED New Year’s Resolution, why not instead create a list of LOTS of things you’d like to do in 2019?
You can sprinkle this list with all sorts of things, big and small, fun and mundane, important and trivial.
Finally get our front steps fixed (check!)
Read more books (check!)
Get our wills done (nope!)
Organize the basement (mostly!)
Get disability insurance (check!)
Get my car detailed every quarter (mostly!)
Paint my bathroom (check!)

Putting your phone away between 6 and 10 pm
Asking your mom to teach you three of her favorite recipes
Making Friday night movie nights

Take a 15-minute walk every day
So what might YOU put on your 19 for 2019 list??! Tell me, tell me!"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/why-im-hosting-a-film-screening,"A few months back, I watched a movie - The True Cost - that created a major change in me.The film explores the environmental and social costs of the ways that our society now makes, buys, consumes, and disposes of clothing. It talks about living wages and factory disasters and toxic dyes and clothing ending up in landfills.
It is NOT an easy movie to watch.
I’m always a little bit hesitant about watching these types of movies. I worry that I will come away feeling guilty and unsure of what to do differently.
In this case, there was a definite feeling of guilt after watching it, but there wasn’t the huge hopelessness. There were actually real ways that I could be a part of the solution. ESPECIALLY given my unique role as a professional organizer.
Every day, I am given the unique honor of going into my clients homes to help them de-clutter and simplify their lives. As we implement the KonMari Method™ together, we get into real, deep conversations about how our “stuff” is making us feel stressed-out, overwhelmed, and often times, downright guilty. My clients often know exactly what they are ready to let go of, but they don’t want to carelessly donate to the local bin behind the strip mall.
They want to be much more mindful of what they buy, and when they are ready to let it go, they want to do so purposefully.
So THAT is why I am hosting a film screening. It creates the hard, visceral reaction that is necessary to truly understand a major systemic problem, and it creates the opening for an awesome, practical dialogue of what can be done.
I shared this desire to host a screening with some amazing #ladybosses at Wellstruck’s Ladyboss event, and the stars aligned. Mary Alice Duff of Alice Alexander graciously agreed to host the screening in her boutique, which is a size-inclusive, ethically-made women’s apparel brand. Each piece in the collection is designed, cut and sewn in Philadelphia by a talented team of sewers paid fair wages. Materials are sourced from within the United States with a focus on sustainable materials.
So, call up your lady friends and invite them to a night out in East Falls, PA on Saturday, November 3rd. Space is limited to 25 people. Shopping and mingling starts at 5:30 pm and the movie starts at 6:15 pm. You can get your tickets right here."
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/would-you-wait-in-line-30-minutes-for-that,"You’re in line at your favorite store. In your hands, you’ve got a scented candle, a pair of sunglasses, and a mug with a cute inspirational saying. (You should have gotten a cart.)
You’ve also got a shirt that you’re worried might be a little too baggy, or not quite the right color, but it should be fine.
An announcement comes over the loudspeaker that the registers are down and will not be up again for 30 minutes.
Would you wait?
Or would you put that stuff down and walk out of the store?
That question is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE question to teach people who are trying to buy less. It often quickly short-circuits that natural knee-jerk reaction to “treat ourselves”.
This is just ONE of the brilliant questions on Sarah Von Bargen’s (@yesandyesblog) Before You Buy wallet card, and it’s hands down one of the best tools that I have discovered since becoming a KonMari consultant.
Other favorites include: “If I hadn’t seen the price tag, how much would I be willing to pay for it?” or “Will this make my life significantly easier or more awesome?”
If it’s a “no”, it’s ok. Just walk out of the store. Right now.
Put down the candle. Put down the slightly-wrong shirt. Put down the mug with the inspirational saying. Hand them to a friendly sales associate with a wink and a smile and go get yourself a latte instead.
Because really, we have enough. We have too much. We don’t need more.

So when I come across a product or company that is doing just that, I CANNOT wait to tell everyone about it.
(Ad nauseum. To the point where people are crossing the street when they see me around town.)
So today, my friends, I want to tell you about something that is sparking some major joy for me - my new toilet paper.
Hysterical, right?
I discovered this joyful new company in the cozy Manhattan bathroom of my dear friend Jocelyn, who also happens to be the CEO of IDEO.org. Jocelyn and I are friends from my former days working in international development, and she’s always got the inside scoop on the coolest new social innovations. When I came out of her bathroom inquiring about her colorful (and funny!) toilet paper, she told me all about Who Gives a Crap, co-founded by her friend and former IDEO.org colleague Danny Alexander. Fast forward about two years, and I finally decided to give it a try.
I am LOVING it because it’s a perfect example of what I am trying to preach to my students and clients all the time: It's fun. It's easy. And it does good.
It's fun.
Ok, just look at that packaging. Each roll is colorfully-wrapped with a fun, cheeky message. (Hehe - cheeky!) It's a quick shot of joy in your day. And it's also fun knowing that I am supporting an ""underdog"" company.
It's easy.
It's on autopilot. Every 5 weeks, it is delivered to my door. Done.
They are doing good.
Their toilet paper is made with 100% recycled paper, and they donate 50% of the profits to help build toilets and improve sanitation in the developing world. (To date, they have donated $1.9 million!)
That's it. Fun, easy and good. Simple and joyful.
So whether or not you decide to delight your bum with this toilet paper, I hope you will see this as an example of how to build more fun, more ease and more impact into the purchasing decisions that you make.
Do YOU have a favorite product, tool or app that makes your life simpler and more joyful? Tell me! Tell me!

Make sure ALL of your clothes are washed.
Drag those off-season clothes out of the basement.
Bring up those coats from the entry-way closet.
Pull out those old bridesmaid dresses. You know, the teal ones with puffed sleeves.
Take a ‘before’ picture of your closet AND your pile.
Step Three:
Divide the clothes into broad categories like: Tops, Bottoms, Skirts, Pajamas, etc. Don’t worry about deciding what to keep yet. Focus on sorting, not discarding.
Step Four:
Now this is where the magic really comes in. You are going to take each and every item of clothing in your hand and ask yourself: Does this spark joy?
Pay attention to how the garment makes you feel. Does it give you a jolt of happiness? Do you love wearing it? Or do you frown, think about feeling frumpy, or have a bad memory?
If it doesn’t spark joy, thank it for its service and let it go with gratitude, ie put it in your “donations” pile.
A few tips:
Get quick wins. Start with a smaller category so that you can feel the momentum.
Make a “maybe” pile. Don’t lose momentum by trying things on that you really can’t decide on. Make a “maybe” pile and try all of those on at the end. (You’ll likely let go of 95% of them!)
Make notes. As you go, write down items that need to be replaced or upgraded.
Take a break. Midway, take a 15-minute break. Have some tea and a light snack.
Take stock. Take stock at the four hour mark. You might need to leave a few categories for homework, like shoes and bags.
Step Five:
Put all of your donations and items to sell right in the car!
Step Six:
Put all of the clothing that sparks joy back into the closet and folded in their drawers. To learn how to do Marie Kondo’s special folding method, visit this video. Think about using all that extra space in your closet to display your favorite items. I put my favorite books and my grandmother’s milk glass on the top shelf of my closet, where all of my bulky sweaters used to fall over onto each other. Some people hang artwork inside the doors or display wedding photos.
A few tips:
Someday = Never. If you find yourself thinking, “I might wear this someday,” think again. Think about your life today. Check out this post for what to do with clothes that don’t fit.
Don’t get bogged down on sentimental items. Set aside sentimental items. Can you turn that fabric into a cool pouch? Can you display it?
Beware of the temptation of ‘selling’. It’s tempting to want to sell your items. Be aware that consignors are VERY selective. Often, you will get more back by donating the item and cashing in on a tax refund. Check out this blog post to learn more about the pros and cons of consigning.
Now sit back, take that after photo, and enjoy!
After just five hours and six steps, you’ve created a closet that gives you joy, easy mornings and a boost of confidence."
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/your-last-minute-holiday-gift-guide,"Running a little behind this year?
Me too, friend. 🙋♀️ Me too.
Don't worry. I've got you.
I've compiled some of my favorite last-minute gift ideas, right here. This one is going to be short and sweet because time is a tickin', and those holiday wish lists aren't going to take care of themselves.
Become best friends with gift cards
At this point in the game, gift cards are going to be your best friend. There are three ways to go:
You can pick up physical gift cards either at the location or at one of those gift card centers in stores and pharmacies.
You can get holiday e gift cards and have them emailed to you (to print and wrap).
You can have the e-gift cards emailed directly to the recipient, usually on a date that you specify.
I prefer the physical gift cards because they usually are very festive and come with cute little envelopes, and you don't have to fuss with a printer. That said, some of my favorite stores and products have lovely printable gift cards.
My favorite ideas for gift cards are below, and I've linked directly to the e-gift card page for each. (You're welcome.)
Balance Bound planners and stationery - Teachers LOVE this line of products from my lovely podcast co-host Brooke Forry and Curious & Co.
Color Guru - I just bought one of these for a friend! (Just click the ""Buy for a friend"" button.) Get 10% off with code INDIGO.
Restaurant group gift cards - Instead of choosing one restaurant, pick a gift card that gives them access to many restaurants. In the Philly area, I love the Starr Group.
Starbucks or Panera Bread - These are great options for working parents or anyone who is always on the go.
Sephora or Ulta - Perfect for that picky teen wants that that trendy lip gloss that you've never heard of.
Who Gives a Crap toilet paper - What says ""I love you"" more than toilet paper? Well, a lot. But this toilet paper is fun, whimsical AND environmentally-friendly.
If you're looking for extra creativity points, you could group a few together to create holiday or Christmas gift themes. For example, maybe you hang the restaurant gift card around a bottle of your favorite wine. Or make it a Gift of Beauty, with both a Sephora and Color Guru gift. Having a theme can help that gift card from feeling so lonely!
Lean into the cozy factor
A few years ago, I poo-pooed the scented candle as a holiday gift. (You must watch this SNL skit about scented candles as gifts.)
But, I gotta say, this year I am all about the cozy holiday gifts. I'm hoping to get some lovely candles, maybe a neutral cozy throw, and I wouldn't turn down some slippers.
These items are usually very easy to find in stores, so they're great last minute gifts. Just try to stick with neutral colors to up your chances of them actually being well-loved.
Keep wrapping easy
Your other best friend, when you're running late, is going to be holiday gift bags. Consider a large Santa Sack, or you could even buy a bunch of brown kraft paper bags that you can write on and/or have the kids decorate.
Whether you're looking for gifts for empty nesters or working parents or just need a few new holiday ideas, I hope you'll find something for everyone on your list with the ideas above!
I'd love to hear from you. What would you add to this list? Maybe some favorite Target holiday gift sets? Other holiday must haves? Ideas for recruiting gift helpers? Holiday gift bag ideas? I'm all ears!"
https://www.indigoorganizing.com/blog/your-netflix-questions-my-answers,"Every day I get texts and messages from friends showing off their newly folded drawers and transformed closets. I LOVE that the show has been a catalyst for so many people to begin simplifying their homes and their lives.
With all the buzz, I’m been getting lots of questions. In today’s blog, I’m answering your most pressing questions about the show and the method.
What’s the real order for the KonMari categories? It seems like they skip around a lot on the show.
There are five KonMari categories: Clothing, Books, Paper, Komono (miscellaneous) and Sentimental.
Typically, when we do a tidying “festival”, we do it in this order because it helps us to hone our senses of what sparks joy in our lives. For example, we often have a visceral reaction to Clothing. It sets the tone for how we start our day and for how comfortable and confident we feel. It’s often easier to understand which items of clothing spark joy, so we start there, so we can learn what “spark joy” feels like.
Alternatively, we do Sentimental items last. This is often the most difficult and emotionally-charged category, so you need to go through all of the other categories first so that you can really hone your sense of what sparks joy.
On the show, you might see them bounce from Clothing to Komono. What happened to Books and Paper? In these cases, the homeowners have likely done these categories, but for the purposes of production, they have edited these out.
I always recommend doing the categories in order, when possible. But, as I said on Instagram, there are no “tidying citations” and no wrong answers. As long as you commit to doing the work and to asking yourself “does it spark joy?”, the rest is pretty flexible.
It seems like Marie Kondo leaves people to their own devices. I don’t think I could do all that work on my own!
I had the same thought! I thought “Wait, where she is going?!? She just left them with a mound of stuff!”. This is another place where reality TV steps in and production takes priority over true reality. When Marie or a KonMari consultant is working with a client, we typically work side-by-side with them in 5-hour chunks of time. We help them work through each item, and we ask questions when they get stuck.
That said, my clients DO often have a decent amount of homework. They might tidy handbags, scarves and belts on their own, once they’ve gotten a hang of things. Or they might have to make a trip to the tailor to hem all those skirts they’ve been meaning to hem.
I also suspect that there were individuals on hand to support these families behind the scenes so that they could continue the work with some guidance, but without Marie and the cameras.
Will all this de-cluttering be bad for the environment?
This is SUCH an important question. If you’ve been following me for a bit, you know that I am passionate about simplifying our homes and our lives SO THAT we can consume and waste less, especially when it comes to our clothes. When I work with my clients, I’m working with them on two things.
First, I’m focused on helping them find good homes for their discards. We take old towels to the animal shelter. We take old laptops to a great non-profit that recycles old electronics while also providing employment opportunities to citizens returning from incarceration. We take half-empty notebooks to the local Free Store. We donate maternity clothes to the local women’s shelter. We even send old worn-out socks to be recycled at Goodwill. It’s important to know the donation options in your area so that you can make sure that your non-trash items can find a second life. Here are some of my favorites in my area.
Second, we’re working on buying LESS. This is major behavior change, and it doesn’t happen overnight, but it’s SO important. I wrote a whole blog post on this topic, and you can see it here. To learn more about over-consumerism in our country, I also highly recommend the documentaries Minimalism and The True Cost on Netflix.
Have more burning questions? Send me an email or comment over on Instagram, and I’ll try to answer them.
Happy tidying, everyone!"

https://www.indigoorganizing.com/faq,"Frequently Asked Questions
Starting your KonMari journey can feel overwhelming. Check out our FAQs below to tame those jitters. You’ve GOT this.
Should I schedule a phone consultation first?
Yes! Phone consultations give us a chance to see if we’re a good fit. We’ll talk about your goals, timeline and budget, and we’ll pick the right package for you.
Do you offer virtual help?
Why yes I do! All of my packages can be done either in-person or virtually.
What's the typical KonMari process?
We commit to getting it done. I work with my clients to choose a ""graduation date"". This helps to keep the momentum going, especially when the going gets tough.
We go by category, not by room. There are five categories: Clothing, Books, Paper, Komono (miscellaneous), and Sentimental.
We decide what sparks joy. You’ll get SO good at knowing the difference between what sparks joy and what sparks ""meh"".
We de-clutter FIRST and buy organizing products LATER, if at all. Don't make the rookie mistake of buying a bunch of bins and baskets to organize things you don’t even want or need. Because, you, my friend, are NOT a rookie.
How many sessions will I need?
That depends on a few things:
the size of your space
how much you have
how quickly you make decisions
how much homework you are able to do between sessions
Usually, people buy a larger package of sessions (at least six sessions). They know they’ll need the support to move through the categories, and they don’t want to feel rushed.
Do I have to start with the clothing category?
In short, you'll be glad you did! The KonMari Method® is all about learning what sparks joy, and our clothing helps us figure that out, FAST. The clothes we wear affect our mornings, our moods and our days. And most of us have WAY too much of it. We can usually get through the Clothing category in one session. After this session, you'll be feeling like a rock star, AND you'll have the momentum you need to KEEP going.
How much does it cost?
Did you know that the average American spends $4958/year on home improvements and repairs? We shell out big bucks for hardwood floors, a new bathroom, or granite countertops. But, after the big renovations are over, we’re often left feeling like our house is still “off”. You can’t enjoy those new floors or countertops if they’re buried under clutter.
My clients say that de-cluttering is the single-best home investment they've made. (Pssst … for less moula than your average bathroom remodel!)
Do you work in my area?
How long is each session?
Both virtual and in-home sessions are 4 hours, depending on your needs. That’s enough time to get a LOT done, but not so much time that you’ll want to chase me out with a frying pan.
You’re gonna need to be in the ZONE, so you’ll want to nix any distractions. Turn off your notifications. Send the kids to the zoo. And then for ice cream. And then to grandma’s. (You’ll want some downtime after I leave so that you can give yourself a big ol’ high-five and dance like no one’s watching.)
What can I expect during my first session?
We'll start with a quick tour of your house. You’ll help me see it through your eyes - what’s driving you crazy and what you WISH it looked and felt like. Then, we’ll get to work! We’ll start on the first category - Clothing - unless you’ve already done some KonMari work on your own.
Will you take care of my donations?
Absolutely! Depending on the plan you choose, we’ve got a bunch of options:
I can help you figure out exactly where to take your things.
We can arrange a donation pick-up
I can take things away (up to 5-6 bags).
The most important thing is to GET IT OUT. You’ve done the hard work, now let those things spark joy ELSEWHERE, my friend.
Will you help me sell my items?
I’ve gotta be honest with you. Except in rare cases, trying to sell online or having a garage isn't worth the time it takes. That said, for those rare items, I can help you figure out how and where to sell them.
Where should I donate?
Do you offer special promotions or discounts?
Sometimes! Make sure you’re on my exclusive mailing list. I send weekly emails called Amanda’s Top 3, where I share 3 bite-sized tips to make your days a little brighter and your life a little easier."

https://www.indigoorganizing.com/preparing-for-our-first-session,"Preparing for our First Session
You can do a few simple things to make our first session successful.
get your supplies ready
Save boxes and bags for a few weeks: If we'll be doing books or komono, please try to save cardboard boxes and plastic grocery bags for several weeks in advance so that we can use them for packing heavier books and fragile items for donation.
get yourself ready
Eat a nice big breakfast: We'll be working hard for several hours, with short breaks as needed, so make sure you have the energy you need. I'll be bringing some snacks for myself, so no need to worry about me.
No need to clean up! It's helpful for me to see your space in its ""natural state"" so that you can really help me see what's working and what's not.
Reduce potential distractions: Figuring out what ""sparks joy"" takes a lot of focus. Make sure that you have a window of 5 hours without phone calls, interruptions, etc. so that can make the most of your time.
Set aside your unmentionables: If there are items that are particularly delicate or private, feel free to set them aside in a private place.
Gather your clothing: Typically, our first category will be clothing. For a sneak peek at the process that we will use, you can review a blog post that I wrote here. Make sure you have everything out of the laundry, from the dry cleaners, etc. We'll want to work with all of your clothes, even off-season clothes.
logistics
Cancellation: If you need to cancel at the last minute, please text me at 484-753-1681, versus sending me an email. I don’t often check my email late at night or early morning.
Parking: If you live in the city and I must use paid parking, I ask that you reimburse me for that expense. Thank you!"
