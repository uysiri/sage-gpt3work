If people don't know how to access information about your ecosystem, they wont.
At EcoMap Tech, our mission is to make information about the ecosystems all around us more accessible. Whether we're working with a city tech hub, a statewide small business community, or an entire industry, we aim to make it possible for anyone to understand ""who exists"" and ""what is going on"" within that ecosystem.
For two years, we've done with by combining curated, detailed, and pre-populated data about the organizations & resources in these ecosystems with our online EcoMap platforms, which have spread like wildfire across the world.
Today, we're excited to announce a new product that makes it even easier for people to access information about the ecosystems around them - the EcoBot, a custom chatbot that delivers curated insights and resources about a specific ecosystem through an easy-to-use conversational interface.
EcoBot makes it possible for people to easily access information about your ecosystem through a corner chatbot that can live on any website. This allows anyone - regardless of where they are or their technical know-how - to easily access curated information about your entrepreneurial ecosystem, industry, or organizational network.
We decided to offer our powerful ecosystem data through a chatbot for three core reasons:
EcoBot is made possible by combing two powerful technologies: the detailed ecosystem data that EcoMap is known for curating, and the same conversational technology that powers OpenAI's ChatGPT. While chatbots such as ChatGPT are incredibly powerful, they are not able to accurately provide information about specific ecosystems, due to their lack of training data and prompts. EcoMap solves this problem by training each EcoBot on curated data specific to that ecosystems so that it responds with contextual, correct resources for all users.
Here are some of the features we're most excited about for EcoBot:
We've already shared EcoBot with select ecosystem partners, and the positive response has been overwhelming. If you want to learn more about EcoBot, you can visit the EcoBot Website or Schedule an EcoBot demo today.
EcoMap Technologies is so excited to offer this new innovation to ecosystems across the world. EcoBot combines our proprietary data curation process with cutting-edge conversational technology to create a product that makes it truly easy for everyone to access information about the ecosystems around them. We couldn't be more honored to bring this powerful technology to our customers & ecosystem leaders across the country."

Four years ago, EcoMap was founded on a simple premise: information about the ecosystems all around us should be more accessible. It was crazy to our founders that you could Google nearly anything, but if you searched “resources for entrepreneurs in Baltimore” or “female-led companies in AR//VR”, you didn’t get any meaningful results. Why was the information so close to us so hard to access?
What seemed like a simple problem - aggregating information about what was happening in an ecosystem - ended up being an incredibly complex one to solve. But after a few years of research and product iteration, we launched the first commercial version of EcoMap for Baltimore’s business community in early 2020. If we only knew then what would come next.
From launch, there was immediate demand for what we had built. Ecosystems across the country began to reach out, wanting a platform to power their local small business or tech community. But then, organizations starting reaching out to get EcoMap to power their industry, corporate network, resource hub, partner community, and more. At that point, we knew we’d built something special.
For the past two years, we have been sprinting to keep up with this demand. Like many startups, we launched with nothing more than an MVP held together by technical duct tape. While delivering platforms for customers spanning the Aspen Institute to Meta, we had to actually build the technology that would become the EcoMap, while simultaneously growing our team at a rapid pace, all during a global pandemic and warranted social unrest.
Many things happened along the way. We got into the Techstars Equitech program, one of their most competitive to date. We raised a small pre-seed round from local partners including MindGrub Ventures, the Baltimore Angels, and Pax Momentum. Most importantly of all, we brought on Sherrod Davis, a powerhouse in Baltimore’s tech ecosystem to join EcoMap as our Chief Operating Officer. His work and dedication is what made this growth possible.
At the same time, we went dark on social media and even with our own personal networks. Keeping up with the inbound demand - even with no marketing - was brutal, and it left little time to engage with the community or even share about our progress. Many people asked if EcoMap was doing okay, thinking we might had fallen victim to the pandemic. In reality, it was the opposite - we were struggling to survive hyper growth.
As a female and Black-led team, the funding needed to scale is harder to come by, a persistent and nefarious problem that should not be lost in the joy of this announcement. But we were incredibly lucky to be connected with the Las Olas team, who immediately understood our vision and acted with unmatched conviction and speed, helping us go from opening to oversubscribed in just 5 weeks.
Now that we've crossed our I’s and dotted our T’s, we’re looking forward to the next phase of EcoMap’s growth. We’ll be expanding our team from 16 to 22, hiring key positions such as a Head of Sales, Head of Marketing, and a Head of Customer Success. Additionally, we’re looking for a stellar Product Growth Marketer and Business Development Associate to support our growth. You can find information on all open jobs at EcoMap here on our website.
We’ll also be doubling down on our commitment to building more accessible and equitable ecosystems, starting right here at home. In the coming weeks, we’ll announce more exciting plans about where we will be headquartering and how we want to engage with the most important ecosystem of all, Baltimore.
The journey to this point was challenging, exhausting, exhilarating - and we still have a long way to go. But because of the support we received from Baltimore’s ecosystem, and the partners & customers across the world who have supported our vision, we now have the resources we need to further our goal of making every ecosystem, accessible to everyone, everywhere.
Thank you to everyone who has supported us to this point, to our amazing team who made this possible, and the numerous mentors and advisors who helped us navigate the most challenging stage of a company’s lifecycle. We wouldn’t be here without you, and we look forward to growing with you.
Sincerely & with thanks,
Pava LaPere, Sherrod Davis, and the EcoMap Team"
5,https://ecomap.tech/blog/building-dallas-for-all-entrepreneurs,"A look at how Dallas, TX is using ecosystem mapping to level the playing field for its entrepreneurs.
Dallas is one of the largest (and fastest-growing) metro areas in the United States. Its GDP ranks 6th among all major American cities. And compared to cities of similar size, like New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago, the cost of living is roughly 30% more affordable. Combine that with low taxes, business-friendly incentives, and several unique resources to benefit the growth of small businesses, Dallas becomes an attractive home for entrepreneurs.
However, lying within the gaps that bottom line statistics fail to measure, something is glaringly wrong: the inclusiveness of its resources.
While strong overall economic growth is apparent, an in-depth report on Dallas’s small business ecosystem by Next Street found that considerable inequalities still exist among entrepreneurs of color, women, and those from historically low-income areas.
In 2020, The Urban Institute ranked Dallas 272nd out of 274 American cities in economic and racial inclusiveness. Some of the top challenges facing underrepresented groups in Dallas were access to capital, networks, mentors, and knowledge of local resources.
An exclusive report by the WFAA found that 20% of banks in the Dallas area do not extend their services to residents who live south of Interstate 30 without approval from regulators.
Communities south of the highway are primarily Black and Hispanic. The banks’ exclusion of these neighborhoods creates significant barriers for business owners who live in them, as bank lending is still the most common form of financing for small businesses.
Typical alternatives to bank loans include fundraising from friends and families or early-stage capital providers. However, most founders from areas with limited personal wealth do not have connections to either, demonstrating how access to social capital can be just as crucial to success as financial capital. A strong network of peers and mentors helps inexperienced business owners navigate obstacles and achieve growth, a luxury that many do not have.
Without easy access to the resources, entrepreneurs painstakingly search for hours to find what they are looking for. Those who spend more time and effort finding resources are already at a disadvantage to those who have direct access to them, as they have less time to spend operating their business.
Despite the city’s numerous available support organizations for small businesses, challenges were present in the coordination and education of these resources. Nearly 80% of the organizations were located on the northern side of Dallas, creating yet another barrier. If a city’s resources are not easily accessible, they are not fully effective.
Without access to these resources, the chances of survival for new firms suffer.
In Nextstreet’s suggested path forward, mapping Dallas’s ecosystem was the top priority. The City of Dallas, eager to work towards fostering inclusiveness, quickly complied. The city hired EcoMap Technologies to research the region and develop a user-friendly database of resources. As a result of the partnership, Dallas B.U.I.L.D (Broadening Urban Investment to Leverage Dallas) was founded.
The Dallas B.U.I.L.D. ecomap aims to ease entrepreneurs’ access to resources to support their ventures and create a thriving local entrepreneurial ecosystem by consolidating previously fragmented resources and making them easy to find based on individual needs. Many of the resources included apply across industries and sectors — most fall under the categories of Funding, Events, and Spaces. Users can navigate to find ventures focused on founders of color, female founders, and veteran founders to help support underrepresented groups. Finally, a list of over 100 business support organizations can be found on the Dallas B.U.I.L.D. website, helping entrepreneurs find relevant organizations to support their venture.
Generational, societal, and economic issues are complex and multifaceted. Such problems take years of dedicated efforts to resolve. However, results have appeared promising one year since launching the EcoMap powered platform.
Entrepreneurs now have access to over 500 resources, compared to only 80 that were previously identified.
The platform allows users to sort by stage of business and various other needs. Such features have aided entrepreneurs in understanding what stage their business is in and helps them clearly define their needs. Business organizations have used the platform to develop a better understanding of who they serve. Most encouragingly, the city has begun to see resources migrating south of Interstate 30, including banks.
The concise presentation of the data has allowed the city to identify areas in need of improvement. EcoMap’s collection and analysis of the resources found a relatively even distribution of resources among startup stages. However, the majority of the resources first identified were categorized in funding (35%), event (22%), and space (16%). The remaining 27% of resources were divided among four different categories: groups, incubators, mentors, and other.
Since identifying the lack of resources in groups, incubators, and mentors, improvements have been made. Users now have access to 25 networking groups, 17 incubators, and 33 mentorship programs. In all, Dallas B.U.I.L.D has become an invaluable resource for the city and has made its resources more inclusive for thousands of underrepresented entrepreneurs.
Depicted below are examples of data that Dallas may access. Having high-quality and up-to-date data enables the city to more effectively serve its residents and make well-informed decisions.
Inclusiveness in entrepreneurship is a problem not exclusive to Dallas. Many American cities are facing similar challenges, and few are doing enough to rectify it. Chicago, for example, has a large Black population and a surging tech scene. However, the two see very little intersection. In 2018, Black Tech Mecca reportedthat only 2% of tech founders and 9% of tech employees in Chicago were Black. Black technologists in the city have noted how few resources are available for Black entrepreneurs. To address such fragmentation in the Chicago ecosystem, data-driven mapping will be necessary.
To work towards a more inclusive future, cities and organizations must realize that a problem exists. But, merely identifying the issue is not enough. Creating a cohesive digitized platform of the ecosystem is the most actionable step forward. By doing so, Dallas separated itself from many major American cities.
And cities vying to become modern entrepreneurial hubs should take note."
6,https://ecomap.tech/blog/case-study-norcal-entrepreneur-hub-launch,"The NorCal Entrepreneur Hub enables innovators, startup founders, and small business owners to find and connect with the right resources for their business, including investors, universities, mentoring programs, networking groups, training programs, and more.
Cameron Law’s path through the entrepreneurial ecosystem mirrors that of a boomerang.
Born and raised in Sacramento, Cameron was determined to see more of the world after graduating UC Davis with his undergraduate degree in Managerial Economics. He set his sights down under with an MBA program at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.
Although at first Cameron didn’t plan to come back to Sacramento “until he was 40-50”, his time in Brisbane expedited that timeline.
Brisbane’s startup community was booming, and the Australian state capital served as a constant reminder of the potential of the Capital Region back home.
After graduating, Cameron swung back to Sacramento with a mission to help catalyze that potential. And he got to work growing his network and capacity.
He worked as a Venture Fellow and Innovation Associate for Impact Venture Capital, where he spearheaded ecosystem building initiatives such as 1 Million Cups (1MC) Sacramento. Afterwards, Cameron served as Executive Director for the non-profit Social Venture Partners of Sacramento, where he worked to connect non-profits, social enterprises, and venture philanthropists to secure greater economic opportunities for the current generation of students.
Then in Fall 2019, Cameron joined the recently-founded Carlsen Center for Innovation & Entrepreneurship at Sacramento State as Executive Director. He was attracted by the nascent center’s mission to serve as the premiere hub for regional innovation & entrepreneurship by being a connector of the broader entrepreneurial community in the Greater Sacramento Region. And in order to do that, Cameron first needed to understand what was actually out there.
--
One of the myriad initiatives/organizations that Cameron is involved in - the Sacramento Entrepreneurial Growth Alliance (SEGA) - had its sights set on bringing a dynamic tool to help track all of the burgeoning growth happening throughout the ecosystem.
While they saw many champions and initiatives popping up to support entrepreneurship in the NorCal region, but no one-stop-shop for an entrepreneur to actually understand all of the resources that are available to them.
Enter EcoMap.
The Carlsen Center - along with Sierra College and Tahoe Prosperity Center - worked with our team to bring the NorCal Entrepreneur Hub to life.
The NorCal Entrepreneur Hub contains data on over 400 resources and nearly 150 organizations throughout the region, in addition to events, news, and jobs that are updated throughout the year.
This platform is designed to enable innovators, startup founders, and small business owners to find and connect with the right resources for their business, including investors, universities, mentoring programs, networking groups, training programs, and more.
All of this is in support of their mission to build and sustain a vibrant and inclusive entrepreneurial community that increases the volume and success of local founders fueling economic growth in the Greater Sacramento region.
--
The NorCal Entrepreneur Hub was unofficially launched in late August with the Growth Factory’s opening event in conjunction with the start of the academic calendar.
Given the wide audience that this platform is meant to serve, a full rollout will involve multiple stakeholders to ensure each segment is getting the value they need out of the platform.
Every ecosystem has a unique way to roll out their EcoMap platform, but Cameron and the team hit on a best practice we've found over time. It's crucial to engage a variety of stakeholders that have a trusted connection with a subsection of the population that the platform is seeking to serve.
By getting buy-in from these stakeholders, it is much more likely that the ecosystem will see this as a platform for all rather than an initiative put on by just one organization.
--
By fostering a greater connectivity and awareness of resources throughout the Greater Sacramento Region, Cameron is hoping to effectively tell the story of the region’s rapid growth over the last five years.
He had completed Forward Cities’ E3 Scorecard Assessment - a tool meant to identify the health and equity of an entrepreneurial ecosystem - and found that Sacramento was lacking most in Identity + Storytelling. The pieces of the puzzle were starting to fit together, but the narrative wasn’t yet in place.
And according to Cameron, there is so much to say.
He is proudest of the quantity and quality of initiatives being propped up in Sacramento - especially as it relates to inclusivity in entrepreneurship.
Examples of that include the Sacramento Chamber of Commerce making $50,000 grants available to support Latino small business in Sacramento County, the SBDC’s Inclusivity Project to support Black and African-American entrepreneurs with capital and mentorship, and FourthWave which is an accelerator for women-led technology businesses.
Each of these resources has the potential to be a game-changer for the entrepreneurs who have the ability to take advantage of them.
The trick is knowing that they exist in the first place.
--
We will check back in with Cameron and the NorCal Entrepreneur Hub early next year to follow-up on the platform’s progress and how the narrative has evolved in Sacramento.

7,https://ecomap.tech/blog/ecomap-recap-2022-national-league-of-cities-nlc-congressional-city-conference-ccc,"For the first time in almost two years exactly, the National League of Cities (NLC) returned to Washington D.C. for its Congressional City Conference (CCC). And what a welcome return it was.
And what a welcome return it was.
NLC President and Union City, GA Mayor Vince Williams kicked off the Opening Remarks by grooving onto the stage with a wide smile plastered on his face. He noted in his Opening Remarks that the previous CCC - March 8th - 10th, 2020 - was the last event that many people attended before the world shut down. NLC CEO Clarence Anthony came on after and set a theme for the conference, asserting “local leaders are the one who brought our nation back” to nods and applause throughout the ballroom.
There was certainly a buzz in the air throughout the Marriot Marquis as old friends and colleagues were finally able to reunite in-person. “How great is it to finally see each other outside of a digital box!”, I overheard one attendee exclaim as they recognized a familiar face.
So why was everyone so excited to reunite?
Over the course of the last two days, it became clear that this was a celebration of all things local.
Local leadership.
Local innovation.
Local ecosystems.
To further understand the impact that a conference like this can have, it’s important to understand some context on two acronyms ...
The NLC is a national network with a hyperlocal focus, comprised of city, town and village leaders that are striving to improve the quality of life for their current and future constituents. They boast nearly 2,500 members across the country and have the ultimate mission of strengthening local leadership, influencing federal policy, and driving innovative solutions.
The CCC is this mission in action.
In its own words, the CCC is meant to “provide local leaders the tools and connections they need to build brighter futures for America's cities, towns and villages.” And what a tool it is.
Political leaders and local change-makers from all over the country gathered to learn, network, and swap stories from home. It was a diverse crowd in every sense of the word - perhaps especially in terms of population served. The CCC boasted council members from towns with a couple thousand people all the way up to the Mayor Eric Adams, who oversees New York City’s population of nearly 9 million.
There were a wide variety of panels and sessions to choose from, so I’m sure every NLC CCC attendee got something different out of the event. Below I’ll dive a little deeper into my takeaways coming from an equitable ecosystem building perspective.
“Equity is the EDA’s top priority”, explained Michelle Chang, the Economic Development Administration’s (EDA) Deputy Assistant Secretary of Policy.
To build on this foundational priority, the myriad programs that the EDA has been able to launch through ARPA funding - specifically the Build Back Better (BBB) Regional Challenge and Good Jobs Challenge (among others) - were established to help strengthen regional ecosystems and make them more resilient to future crises.
Importantly, Chang said the EDA is not going in with a “Washington Knows Best” approach, but rather allowing local ecosystem organizations to partner and submit their own proposals to fund the programs that have the highest local impact potential. To that end, they’ve received over 500 applications for each BBB and the Good Jobs Challenge and are currently in the process of disbursing funding to the finalists.
Antwaun Griffin - the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Chief of Staff - emphasized the importance of tapping into local ecosystem solutions when dolling out millions of dollars of funding. He cited illuminating statistics that showed the gap that exists in communities. For example, during 2020 it was reported that 22% of small businesses closed for at least some period of time. That number jumps to 41% and 30% for Black and Hispanic-owned business, respectively. Another SBA survey showed that “lack of relevant information” was the main problem for 51% of small business respondents.
The SBA’s flagship program to address these structural inequalities is the Community Navigator Pilot Program (CNPP). Through the CNPP, the SBA has funded 51 programs championing small businesses in underserved communities through a “Hub and Spoke” model. Each of these 51 grantees are considered “Hubs” in their communities, which are then connected with up to 6 “Spokes” that provide more targeted entrepreneurial support services, such as microlending or demographic-specific assistance.
The NLC also has direct entrepreneurship support services. Jenn Steinfeld - the NLC’s Director of Entrepreneurship & Economic Development - provided a helpful overview of how the NLC works with their members to promote more equitable economic development on a local level. The key to working with over 200 member cities? There’s not a “one size fits all” approach that can be plugged in to each city without taking into account the context and systemic issues best known to local actors.
The City Inclusive Entrepreneurship (CIE) Network is the program that the NLC uses in order to meet each ecosystem where they are and provide a variety of solutions that best fits their needs. The graphic above outlines all of the various avenues that NLC offers its members through the CIE Network.
In addition to equity in economic development/inclusive entrepreneurship, the term “digital equity” was certainly a theme of the conference - first introduced by ex-Chattanooga mayor and current NTIA Special Representative Andy Berke. During his 8 year term as mayor (2013 - 2021), Berke pioneered citywide broadband internet access and led a partnership to provide high speed broadband at no cost to every family with a child on free or reduced lunch, making Chattanooga the first community in the country to take this step.
A session called “Closing the Digital Divide: Leveraging Federal Resources for Broadband, Digital Equity” doubled down on the need for this type of work by illustrating the gaps that were amplified due to COVID-19 over the past couple of years.
One of those examples hit close to home for the EcoMap team - Baltimore. According to a report on digital equity and access, it was reported that over 50% of Baltimore public school children reported not having access to stable WiFi during the pandemic. This led to many students attending class or doing homework in places such as McDonald’s parking lots.
To that end, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott hired the city's first Director of Digital Equity last Spring - and then in November 2021 - announced a plan to invest $35 million of ARPA funding in the city to address this specific issue.
“The COVID-19 pandemic showed us that internet access is critical, basic public infrastructure. From our students to our older adults, Baltimoreans struggled to learn virtually, work from home, and access needed telemedicine on unreliable, slow connections and limited access to broadband,” said Mayor Brandon M. Scott. “We will not wait — today’s $35 million investment with American Rescue Plan dollars is about taking an active role and kickstarting our efforts to not just bridge the divide, but close it once and for all, with a strong focus on our residents and neighborhoods lacking access. This is just the beginning.”
ARPA has billions of dollars earmarked towards helping communities close the digital divide and bring high-speed internet through access to affordable broadband internet. Thanks to links shared by Christopher Mitchell - Director of the Community Broadband Networks Initiative within the Institute for Self-Reliance - you can learn more about those resources below.
High profile speakers such as Nancy Pelosi, Pete Buttigieg, and even Joe Biden took the stage to stress the importance of federal and local cooperation when it comes to carrying out the economic recovery programs enacted by this Administration, particularly the $65.1 billion in American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funding which was approved just over a year ago.
A recurring theme for these national leaders? Money may flow down federally, but real impact happens locally.
“When I was a mayor, I believed that the most important stuff got done on a local level. Now that I’m in the cabinet ... I know that to be the case”, Secretary Buttigieg quipped to knowing laughter.
Nearly every speaker at the NLC CCC stressed what a momentous opportunity we have to shape this country in this economic recovery. Not since days of the Eisenhower Administration has there been so much federal investment being made in local infrastructure.
And according to the leaders we heard from, the impact that this investment can make is in local hands. It will be up to local ecosystems to come together, assess their greatest needs, and write a prescription to solve their specific problem.
That’s why EcoMap was at the NLC CCC, and where we believe we can help.
Our whole mission is to help local leaders better understand and serve their ecosystem.
We have built a platform that can rapidly feed in data, like the key organizations and the resources they offer, spin that up into a highly accessible platform for their citizens, and then keep that data up-to-date over time. Cities and their assets evolve over time. We can evolve with them.
This is a critical opportunity for local leaders to understand the assets they do have, and importantly, discover what’s still missing. It’s the first step to creating a more connected, equitable, and navigable ecosystem.
For any cities that had a representative in attendance for the NLC CCC, EcoMap is happy to offer a 20% discount for getting an EcoMap platform up and running for your city. To see an example of how an EcoMap can make your cities' ecosystem more accessible, you can check out the platform we recently launched in Baltimore with the goal of closing the city's stark digital divide: Baltimore Tech Connect

8,https://ecomap.tech/blog/ecomap-recap-sba-2022-innovation-ecosystem-summit,"The Small Business Administration (SBA) hosted its second annual Innovation Ecosystem Summit last week - and based on the flurry of ecosystem building initiatives happening across federal agencies, industry leaders, and local champions - it certainly seems like it is here to stay.
Over 1,500 people signed up for the two-day virtual event that featured a variety of engaging panel discussions, keynote speeches, and networking opportunities - providing attendees with valuable insights and information about players all across of the innovation ecosystem.
As Jennifer Shieh (SBA’s Director of Ecosystem Development) noted in the Summit’s opening remarks, the fact that her unique job title even exists is another proof point of the agency’s dedication towards developing equitable access and opportunity for innovators across the country by lowering the barrier to participation.
Inclusive, collaborative efforts were certainly a central theme throughout the Summit. Many of the sessions focused on panels or speakers who had notable experience in building mutually-beneficial partnerships across regions, industries, and demographics.
Members of the EcoMap team were in attendance to learn about the latest developments in the innovation ecosystem from the jam-packed lineup of leaders across federal, local, non-profit, and startup organizations.
While it will be impossible to recap all of the knowledge dropped over the two-day Summit, post is meant to take some of the insights that we gained from the sessions and turn them into themes & takeaways that will resonate with our fellow ecosystem builders.
Without further ado, let’s dive in.
Building trust is essential in the field of ecosystem building. Trust is the foundation on which effective collaborations and partnerships are built, and it is essential for creating a sense of community and shared purpose among stakeholders.
However, trust doesn’t develop overnight.
There were many fantastic examples of how Summit speakers were able to lay the foundation for successful partnerships between organizations, but perhaps none best illustrates this example than the relationship between Village Capital (VilCap) and Black Innovation Alliance (BIA).
Allie Burns (CEO of VilCap) and Kelly Burton (CEO of BIA) are both leaders of organizations who have been doing ecosystem building work before it was even labeled as such. Over time, they saw an apparent need in this space to “train the trainers” by equipping local entrepreneur support organizations (ESOs) that focus on founders of color with the resources they need to be more effective.
After many thoughtful conversations between Allie and Kelly about how they could provide a resource that scales, they came up with Resource: an “ESO Accelerator” that equips ecosystem builders of color with training, community, and connections to capital needed to be sustainable. Additionally, Resource has plans to coalesce a national community of practice among ESO leaders of color and their funders to share best practices and “develop stronger capital and mentorship pathways” for Black, Latinx and Indigenous founders across the country.
By leveraging their organization’s unique strengths - and by bringing in other key financial and mission-aligned partners - Allie and Kelly were able to build off their previous trust in order to develop a shared Resource (quite literally) that can do more than any individual effort.
Another key pillar of the SBA Innovation Ecosystem Summit is the renewed commitment by various federal agencies to support ecosystem builders as well as the entrepreneurs they serve with one of the most precious resources - bundles of grant funding.
Representatives from the SBA, Economic Development Administration (EDA), Department of Energy (DOE), and the National Institute of Health (NIH) among others were able to share details and success stories from their respective agencies’ recent funding mechanisms.
Amanda Kosty, a Program Analyst within the Office of Innovation and Entrepreneurship at the EDA, described herself as being “in the business of building ecosystems”. The EDA’s ethos involves funding a variety of tech-based entrepreneurship development strategies for regions, primarily the Stem Talent Challenge and Build 2 Scale. Each of these programs are all about funding intermediary organizations by giving them a boost to develop capacity programs or funding geared towards early-stage companies de-risking their technologies.
Victor Krane (DOE) noted that when people typically think about his agency, they think about basic R&D funding. But because historically much of that funding hadn’t made its way to market, his office - the Office of Technology Transitions - is focused on broadening the public impact of DOE-funded research. A big mechanism the DOE uses is prizes that encourages regional collaborative innovation, such as the case with the Energy Program for Innovation Clusters (EPIC Prize).
And despite all of the new funding initiatives being rolled out, you can’t forget about one of the largest sources of early-stage grant funding - the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, otherwise affectionately known as “America’s Seed Fund”. Eleven agencies have their own agency SBIR/STTR which distribute billions of dollars to innovative young companies each year. Matt McMahon, Director of SEED NIH, oversees a $1.2 billion dollar SBIR/STTR fund within his agency. But more than just providing this funding, Matt emphasized the importance of plugging the awardees into the ecosystem so they can access the resources & funding needed to reach the next stage of their entrepreneurial journey.
One of those additional resource partners is Amy Beaird, the Program Director for Florida High Tech Corridor’s (FHTC) Cenfluence program. It focuses on leveraging local partnerships in Central Florida to build equitable and prosperous economic clusters, one of those being the Energy + Environmental Sciences. They utilize federal resources like the Federal and State Technology (FAST) program that are geared towards making sure SBIR/STTR-focused ESOs that work with underserved populations can help close the divide in who receives these awards.
Through all of these initiatives and more, the federal government is demonstrating a cohesive approach towards providing funding and initiatives that create a more equitable innovation ecosystem.
Academia has long been a key cog in innovation, with university-based spin-offs making up some of the most impactful inventions in the history of the nation. Even the internet itself has its digital roots at Cal Berkeley.
Academic centers often have access to a wealth of research and expertise that can be valuable to entrepreneurship support organizations. By building stronger connections, these organizations can tap into this knowledge base and use it to support entrepreneurs and their businesses.
The SBA convened a panel of experts in this space, moderated by Megan Aanstoos who is a Licensing & New Venture Manager and Kentucky Commercialization Ventures. One of those panelists was a familiar face to us in Maryland’s innovation ecosystem.
Lindsay Ryan, the Interim Executive Director of Economic Development for the University System of Maryland (USM), is also one of the customers of EcoMap’s Maryland Entrepreneur Hub - our state-wide resource to support all entrepreneurs. Lindsay touched on the importance of providing resources at a various stage of an entrepreneurs' journey. A student entrepreneur who just had an idea for a startup two days ago needs a vastly different array of resources than a growth-stage startup looking to scale up operations. That's exactly the area our Maryland Entrepreneur Hub supports.
Other panelists spoke on the importance of connecting ecosystem building efforts within university or learning-centric environments. Christiana Russell - Partner & CEO of the San Diego-based We Tha Plug - mentioned one of the most effective ways she found to develop an ecosystem is to form an alliance with universities, local government, and other ESOs. To that end they have an EDA grant at UCSD that was set up to both draw the community into their local innovation center as well as make sure the university as access to the rest of the community.
Stephanie Santoso - Co-Founder and President of MakerUSA - focuses on partnering with underserved communities outside of major economic hubs by using maker spaces as a focal point. She has helped to develop the Learning Network, a national community of practice comprised of 34 leading institutions and organizations across 20 states. The Learning Network provides no-cost programming, technical assistance, and resources involving maker education and career pathways to maker industries among its members. Similar to VilCap/BIA Resource initiative, the Learning Network serves as a model to unite a community of practice and ensure the rising tide of knowledge can lift all boats.
The last session of the first day featured Beth Zimmer, the Program Manager for the Ecosystem Building Leadership Project (EBLP). This was a session close to EcoMap’s own heart as our Co-Founder/CEO Pava LaPere is a member of the inaugural Provisional Council.
Jennifer Shieh moderated a fireside chat with Beth that centered on the purpose and outlook for the EBLP, which follows a co-designed and co-leadership model from its members.
So … what exactly makes someone an ecosystem builder? According to Beth, it’s someone who approaches their work from a systems perspective and works to understand how activate different actors & relationships to maximize impact.
She came into this field almost by accident, jokingly referring to herself as a “recovering aerospace industry recruitment executive” who always had ecosystem building tendencies at heart. Now she is one of the leading voices behind the EBLP, which aims to further professionalize the field and provide a structure that fellow ecosystem builders can use to be that connective tissue within their respective communities.
The EBLP members came together in Indianapolis this past September in order to meet face-to-face for a series of Strategic Doing workshops. These workshops were primarily geared around three framing topics:
Members then broke into advisory groups to put the co-designing and co-leadership ethos to the test. The EBLP team has been meeting regularly since that initial session in Indy and is working towards accelerating wider understanding and adoption of ecosystem building as a practice in economic, community, workforce and entrepreneurship development. The Provisional Council is expected to lay out and deploy a plan no later than October 2023.
Time will tell the impact that EBLP can have on the nascent field of ecosystem building - but judging by the members who make up this superstar coalition - it has the potential to make a substantial difference on how it is defined and resourced.

As an organization, EcoMap is thrilled to see the federal government’s conscious efforts to develop community around ecosystem builders and back up its language with myriad programs to create onramp for historically underrepresented groups all over the country. Those that came to this Summit with the intention of developing connections or uncovering methods to further ecosystem building efforts surely did not leave empty-handed.
The focus on traditionally underserved founders/communities was especially apparent, as many panels featured all-female or all-underrepresented members.
In her opening remarks, SBA’s Director of Ecosystem Development Jennifer Shieh half-jokingly stated that she eventually “wants to work herself out of a job because I doesn’t want anyone to be underrepresented anymore”.
While Jennifer might not be working herself out of a job anytime soon, it is apparent that the federal government is demonstrating a level of financial and programmatic commitment to equitable ecosystem building that has never been seen before.
We look forward to hearing these updates and more at what is sure to be the third annual SBA Innovation Ecosystem Summit next year.
EcoMap was founded based on a simple premise: it should be easy to access information about what's happening in the ecosystems all around us. Whether we're dealing with a local business community or an entire industry, we think that everyone should be able to easily navigate every ecosystem, everywhere.
At EcoMap, we're on a mission to build more equitable & accessible ecosystems through technology. We developed powerful technology that lets us digitize them at scale, so that any ecosystem building organization can use our products to understand, showcase, and engage their ecosystems."
9,https://ecomap.tech/blog/ecomap-recap-scn-fall-2022-summit,"Team EcoMap headed to the SCN Fall 2022 Summit down in Fort Worth, Texas. Check out our EcoMap ReCap post to get a taste of all the ecosystem-based action happening down in Funky Town
Hosted by the University of North Texas Health Science Center HSC Next team - a startup and small business incubator in Fort Worth that provides resources for innovators, inventors and entrepreneurs to take their ideas to the next level - this year’s conference welcomes attendees who made their way from all over the world to engage with their fellow ecosystem builders.
This year’s summit took place in the Fort Worth Stockyards, which was the first point of commerce in the now-sprawling city. Every day, twice a day, the famous longhorn cattle drive takes place on Exchange Ave. as a nod to the city’s roots. But it’s quite clear today that Fort Worth is so much more than “Cow Town” (another of its myriad nicknames). It is home to a diverse set of leaders, innovators, educators, and creatives that have found their niche in the city.
And for brief time in Fall 2022, it was also home to ecosystem builders from around the world.
It's hard to describe the buzz in the air that results from ~100 ecosystem builders gathering in a single place to connect, learn, and grow - and it will be impossible to capture everyone's unique Summit experience. But regardless, it was impossible to spend time in Fort Worth and not get re-energized by the innovation happening and movements manifesting across the city.
Before we dive into the full ReCap, if you’re not yet familiar with the incredible organization known as SCN, you might have a fair question ...
In case you’re wondering “WTF is SCN?”, Startup Champions Network (SCN) is a group of ecosystem builders from across the country who support entrepreneurial ecosystem builders by providing them with the tools, resources, knowledge and support systems they need to build thriving and inclusive entrepreneurial ecosystems in their own community.
One of SCN’s primary activities is a bi-annual Summit put on by ecosystem builders, for ecosystem builders.
According to their own words, SCN Summits are meant to accomplish three primary goals:
Every SCN Summit has a series of threads that weave the conference together, and this year was no different.
The theme of this year’s Summit was Making a Movement, which led to content focused on actionable steps to start small movements for increased entrepreneurial activity in communities around the country with a goal to “kickstart an entrepreneurial renaissance in the U.S.” In order to fulfill this year’s theme, SCN hosted sessions around the themes of Ecosystem Metric Tracking, Ecosystem Storytelling, Breaking Down Barriers, and then a tour of Fort Worth’s innovation ecosystem.
Given how much there was to see and do in Fort Worth, each attendee at SCN probably got something a little different out of the conference. That being said - no matter who you were - I’m willing to bet you left inspired to make a movement of your own.
One of the running themes of this SCN summit was a Greek word that might not have been familiar to attendees beforehand (speaking for myself at least). While quite literally translating to “love of place”, this word tends to mean “a strong sense of place, which often becomes mixed with the sense of cultural identity among certain people and a love of certain aspects of such a place.”
Marco Johnson - one of our wonderful Summit hosts from HSC Next - who brought up the concept as a part of an ongoing attempt to measure “love of place”.
One of the great things about each SCN Summit is how it highlights the local ecosystem in which it takes place which can lead to that sense of topophilia.
We had the opportunity to choose between an Innovation Tour at the Mobility Innovation Zone or an Arts & Sciences Tour at the HSC Campus & Kimbell Art Museum. I attended the latter in order to get an idea of how both “left brain” and “right brain” minded folks both developed a love of place in Fort Worth.
The UNT HSC is one of the U.S.’s top academic medical centers - despite being among the smallest - and our tour gave a great example of why. We had the opportunity to explore a relatively new building that is home to a cutting-edge “Regional Simulation Center” and hear from two distinct panels that call Fort Worth home.
The first was comprised of two scientific entrepreneurs who call HSC Next’s lab space home. Robert England - CEO of Memsel Inc. - was adamant that without HSC Next’s early stage support, it would be an incredible challenge to get off the ground. When asked how much the lab space would’ve cost to build out on their own dime, England chuckled and offered up “millions” as an answer. HSC Next takes equity in the companies that utilize its space and resources, but doesn’t charge any up front rent for the otherwise-costly lab space. This creates a level of long-term alignment in success as opposed to a renter/rentee relationship.
The other panel consisted of members of the Fort Worth entrepreneurial arts scene, including Asa Aziz, Dhananjaya (DJ) Perera, and George Apodaca. Each of the panelists brought a multi-hyphenate perspective to the panel - Asa being a DJ/respiratory therapist, DJ being a classically trained painter/professor, and George being a videographer/co-working space owner. Together they shared the ups and downs of making your way as in the creative field, with a focus on intersectionality of culture and art form. It’s no surprise that a city as large and diverse as Fort Worth has developed into a top-notch arts scene, with those who call it home (such as Leon Bridges) never forgetting where they come from.
Another one of our summit hosts - Cameron Cushman - has quite an extensive history with entrepreneurial ecosystem building. In fact, he was doing this work at the Kauffman Foundation before this field even had a proper name.
Alongside Nate Olson - another 1MC Co-Founder who really spearheaded the concept’s regional expansion - and Darlisa Diltz - who started 1 MC Cup chapter in local NE Tarrant County - the panel told the origin story of the now ubiquitous networking event on its 10 year anniversary.
And it started with a question.
“How do you help people if you don’t know what they’re building or even what their names are?”
Cameron and Nate set out to lay the groundwork for a Kansas City networking event that provided a safe space for entrepreneurs to share their ideas, challenges, and wins with one another without fear of being pitched hardcore by a service provider. By the end, you were guaranteed to learn at least a few more names of your fellow entrepreneurs.
So how did they keep it from being human-centered and less transactional?
Part of it was the 9 am Wednesday timing. Those who had to work typical 9-5 jobs couldn’t usually take off to attend so the crowd tended to be more entrepreneurial by nature. As Nate noted, “The last thing you want to happen at a networking event is be pitched by an insurance salesman at 9 am”.
Another aspect was the consistency. Week in, week out - 1MC organizers made sure to have an event ready to go for whoever wanted to attend. Maybe there would be 12 people. Maybe there would be 120. No matter what, entrepreneurs knowing they had a place they could go to meet up with their community each week kept the momentum building.
A final key to 1MC’s smashing success over the last decade? Community involvement. The 1MC team realized early on that getting the word out about the program (and expanding it) couldn’t be done in a top-down manner. They relied on local entrepreneurs - first in Kansas City, and later throughout Iowa, the rest of the Midwest, and then the country - to be the driving force. That’s why 1MC events were able to develop their own distinct personality that reflected the region and organizers behind them.
Are you interested in either attending a 1MC event or starting your own chapter?
At the last Summit in Raleigh, EcoMap debuted what we deemed the Map What Matters challenge. This challenge is an opportunity to try your hand at mapping an ecosystem that matters the most to you using a version of the paradigm EcoMap has developed mapping dozens of ecosystems.
The goal for this challenge is two-fold:
Last year we had 3 participants enter the challenge and all walk out with EcoMaps - including our summit host HSC NEXT! (view the platform)
This year we have slightly modified the challenge but are happy to be back with Round 2 of Map What Matters!
So … what exactly do you have to do?
You will use an abridged version of EcoMap’s paradigm (Click here for the challenge template) to map out at least 20 resources and their associated support organizations within your community. Included in the template are 5 examples of what it may look like filled out from your end, using the Fort Worth creative entrepreneurship ecosystem.
We estimate this will take roughly 30 mins - 1 hour to complete, depending on your attention span and intrinsic knowledge of the ecosystem you support. You will likely have to do a little Googling!
And … what exactly do I get for doing this challenge?
You mean other than the satisfaction of having a better understanding of the critical resources available to your ecosystem?
We are offering a waived implementation fee for an EcoMap Basic platform to anyone who completes this challenge by December 31st, 2022. So if you’ve been eyeing an EcoMap as a way to support your ecosystem’s stakeholders, this could be the opportunity you’ve been looking for! But remember - you must be a SCN Member or have attended the SCN Fall 22 Summit in order to participate.
As I wrap up this ReCap as concisely as possible (who wants to read a novel anyway?), I would be remiss to not give some rapid fire shoutouts to those who contributed to my own experiences in this conference.
(This list is in no particular order and please don’t hate me if I left your contribution out!)
SCN has been taking its show on the road for almost a decade at this point, and towards the end of our Fort Worth Summit the next TWO locations for SCN were announced.
drumroll please
In Spring ‘23, SCN Goes to Washington (D.C.) and in Fall ‘23 SCN heads to the Valley of the Sun in Phoenix, AZ!
Keep an eye out for dates and an official announcement soon. And make sure to sign up for SCN Membership to keep the community going even outside of Summit season.
Take care and see you then,
Kevin"
10,https://ecomap.tech/blog/ecomap-recap-scn-spring-summit-2022,"Last week, Startup Champions Network (SCN) welcomed over 140 attendees to The Triangle in North Carolina in what turned out to be the largest in-person conference in the organization’s history. No Bull.
Hosted by Durham-based Forward Cities - a national nonprofit equipping communities and regions to grow and sustain more equitable entrepreneurial ecosystems - this year’s conference welcomed attendees who came from all over the country to share their stories and learn from one another.
While we were unfortunately missing our fearless Co-Founder/CEO Pava LaPere due to illness, the EcoMap team came out to represent in The Triangle. I (Kevin Carter, Head of Business Development) was joined by our co-founder/COO Sherrod Davis, Customer Success Specialist Maria Ulayyet, and Ecosystem Expert Leslie Scott. And somehow, we forgot to take a team photo in all of the madness.
It's hard to describe the buzz in the air that results from 100+ ecosystem builders gathering in a single place to connect, learn, and grow - and it will be impossible to capture everyone's Summit experience. But I suppose the point of this post is to try to capture that experience from the EcoMap perspective.
(A special shoutout to Ashley Ray who captured the Summit with some beautiful photos - all photo cred below goes to her!)

In case you’re wondering “WTF is SCN?”, Startup Champions Network (aka SCN) is a group of ecosystem builders from across the country who support entrepreneurial ecosystem builders by providing them with the tools, resources, knowledge and support systems they need to build thriving and inclusive entrepreneurial ecosystems in their own community.
One of SCN’s primary activities is a bi-annual Summit put on by ecosystem builders, for ecosystem builders.
According to their own words, SCN Summits are meant to accomplish three primary goals:

Improve Ecosystem Builders' knowledge and best practices
Help Ecosystem Builders develop mission-critical skills
Every SCN Summit has a series of threads that weave the conference together, and this year was no different.
The theme of this year’s Summit was ""Building Together: Catalyzing Regional Inclusive Prosperity"", which lended itself to three tracks attendees could choose from:
Each attendee at SCN probably got something a little different out of the conference, so this ReCap is specific to the EcoMap experience. That being said - no matter who you were - I’m willing to bet that those three primary goals listed above were accomplished.
Without further ado, let’s dive in.
---
One of the great things about each SCN Summit is how it highlights the local ecosystem in which it takes place. SCN attendees had the opportunity to get well acquainted with Durham during our short stay there - both through the city itself and its citizens (whom made up a notable portion of attendance).
We had the opportunity to choose between two tours which showcased elements of the city that are embedded into the very fabric of Durham - Black Wall Street and Research Triangle Park (RTP).
I ended up selecting the Black Wall St. tour which was an eye-opening experience. I’m ashamed to admit that thought the only Black Wall Street in America was located in Tulsa, but that couldn’t be further than the truth. Our tour guide was a local musician and storyteller - Aya Shabu - who walked us through how Durham’s Black Wall Street became a focal point of Black entrepreneurship during Reconstruction-era America and its legacy is still shaping the Bull City today.
Anchored by two massive financial institutions - NC Mutual Life Insurance Company (the largest Black-owned insurance company in the world) and Mechanic & Farmers Bank (the second-oldest minority-owned bank in the US) - Black entrepreneurs in Durham were able to access startup capital in an unprecedented manner for the time period. Furthermore, the nearby neighborhood of Hayti was a hub of Black business savvy and community support which fueled the rise of the region to what became known as ‘the Mecca of the Black South’.
While I feel like I cannot do justice in this ReCap to all that I learned on the tour, I highly encourage you do read up on the history of Durham’s Black Wall St. through some of the links below.

EcoMap was privileged to co-host the session that kicked off Tuesday morning along with SCN Board Member (and EcoMap customer) Paulo Gregory.
If you have ever had the pleasure of meeting Paulo, you would agree that everything he does has inclusion and equity at the forefront. Building out a digital community for Baltimore’s Black small business owners - the BLK BTRFLY EXCHANGE - was no exception.
In a conversation with our Co-Founder/COO Sherrod Davis, Paulo outlined how he worked with the EcoMap team to build a platform that could reflect the cultural nuances of the community he was serving.
Specifically, Paulo noted that other tech platforms he was looking at didn’t offer the customizability of relevant imagery, naming conventions, and flexible information displayed. Quite simply, he said, they “didn’t look like a space for us”.
Why does this form of ‘tequity’ of matter?
If you’re building a community and it doesn’t reflect the lived experiences of the people you’re serving, it can result in a lack of trust of the platform/information itself.
As Paulo mentioned during the talk, if it looks like you’re “showing up shabby”, it’s going to turn off that community from trusting the platform as a valuable resource.
So a huge shoutout to Paulo and the entire BLK BTRFLY crew who made the trip from our beloved Baltimore to shed a little light on why ‘Tequity’ matters.
Building off of that last point, one final through line of the Summit was the importance of relationships and trust in ecosystem building.
Throughout the past couple of years, we’ve all had to adapt to the new reality of building relationships in a digital-first manner. For ecosystem builders - where relationships & trust are such an integral part of the work that we do - this was noticeably difficult.
Especially in many underserved and under-resouced communities, where Trust itself is a valuable resource, it is damn near impossible to build that without taking the time to listen to the lived experiences of those who we are seeking to serve.
As Debbie Irwin of Shenandoah Community Capital Fund put it during a panel session, “the first thing I did was shut up and go on a listening tour”.
One of the highlights for the EcoMap team was the chance to build in-person relationships with so many of our customers and fellow ecosystem builders, many of whom we met in ""real life"" for the first time.
It was an absolute pleasure to sit down, break bread, and have face-to-face conversations with so many people that we’ve mainly met through the confines of a Zoom screen including:
Having the opportunity to connect on a much deeper level than Zoom meetings typically allow for was a refreshing and rejuvenating experience. It reminded me of the reason why we at EcoMap do this work - heck - why most of us do this work: and that’s the people.
Ecosystem building can take a systems-centered approach or a people-centric approach, but the true value lies in combining those approaches to make sure those we serve can trust both elements along their entrepreneurial journey.
And if the systems (or people) are not working as designed, let’s not be afraid to call that out for the sake of more equitable opportunities in the future.
As I wrap up this ReCap as concisely as possible (who wants to read a novel anyway?), I would be remiss to not give some rapid fire shoutouts to those who contributed to my own experiences in this conference.
(This list is in no particular order and please don’t hate me if I left your contribution out!)
Things might get even bigger for SCN’s next summit as it was announced that the Fall 2022 edition will be hosted in the great city of Ft. Worth, TX!
Ft. Worth had a sizable delegation at this year’s summit, including members of the HSC Sparkyard and just-announced Techstars Accelerator with a focus on Physical Health.
Keep an eye out for dates and an official announcement soon.
Take care and see y’all in Texas."
11,https://ecomap.tech/blog/ecomap-recap-startup-champions-network-scn-2021-fall-summit,"The Startup Champions Network (SCN) met in-person for the first time since March 2020, and nothing notable has happened since then.
The Startup Champions Network (SCN) met in-person for the first time since March 2020, and nothing notable has happened since then.
All jokes aside, there was a palpable feeling of excitement in the air as SCN convened again in a post-pandemic world, after just sneaking the last San Antonio-based Summit in under the wire March 10–12 last Spring. So much of the work that ecosystem builders do depend on human connections, something we’ve all come to realize just doesn’t translate the same way via Zoom.
Ecosystem builders around the country — and even one from Colombia (shoutout to Flor) — convened in Des Moines, Iowa to discuss the ups, downs, and everything in between of the work that we do. The EcoMap team’s contingent to this conference consisted of Sherrod Davis — our COO — and Kevin Carter (me) — our Head of Business Development.
While I could do a session-by-session recap of everything that happened at the SCN Fall 2021 Summit, I don’t believe that would do it justice. With so many divergent sessions and breakout opportunities, no two attendees had the same experience.
Instead, I thought it would be helpful to break down the Summit into three themes that emerged throughout. No matter which sessions you attended, or the people you spoke with, these seemed to be the undercurrent of what SCN Fall 2021 is all about.
One of the first themes of the Summit emerged during the Summit Kickoff session.
The majority of the events took place in the vibrant and spacious Gravitate Coworking hub in downtown Des Moines, and I could not picture a better venue for the occasion.
Geoff Wood, the Founder of Gravitate and one of the fantastic hosts for this Summit, gave all of us out-of-towners a brief history of Des Moines. More on that later.
One of the primary symbols of the city are the three bridges — Walnut, Locust, and Grand — that connect Des Moines from East to West. These bridges are proudly depicted on the red, white, and blue Des Moines city flag. The blue undercurrent represents the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers that run through the city while the red trapezoid symbolizes its passionate residents who serve as its lifeblood.
Ecosystem builders, Geoff said, are inherently bridges.
Bridges to resources. Bridges to people. Bridges to entire communities.
Our primary purpose as ecosystem builders is to help those cross over the troubled waters of venture building and reach the other side. Although bridges alone do not drive an entire ecosystem, they are the infrastructure that enable its entrepreneurs to reach their desired destinations.
This flag really connects with many city residents, perhaps none more than the Des Moines natives in the room who played a big role in bringing the SCN Summit to their city. Accordingly, Geoff showed off the Des Moines flag tattoo that covers his inner arm during the Summit Kickoff.
He is one of the supportive bridges in the Des Moines ecosystem, after all.
As someone who had never the pleasure of visiting Des Moines before, I have to admit I was pretty clueless about the city’s history. I really thought of the two Big C’s — corn & caucuses. But the SCN Fall 2021 Summit did a fantastic job at letting Iowans tell the story of Des Moines’ development of its entrepreneurial ecosystem over the past couple of decades and arts scene over the past couple of decades.
Eric Engelmann — the Founding Executive Director of the New Bohemian Innovation Collaboration (conveniently shorthanded to NewBoCo) — gave a wonderful summation of Des Moines’ entrepreneurial history on Day 1.
While it would be incorrect to say “nothing was there” prior to the turn of the millennium, Eric mentioned that entrepreneurs in the region weren’t really talking to each other about the concept of ecosystem building.
A huge turning point came when Iowa became the 8th region in the Startup America Partnership — a collaboration between the Kauffman Foundation and White House in 2011 to jumpstart entrepreneurial ecosystems around the country. This Partnership provided resources such as new networks, funding opportunities, and accelerator programs to bring Iowan innovators out of the woodwork.
From there, once these soon-to-be ecosystem builders finally started to gather in the same spaces, the greater Iowa ecosystem began to boom.
Geoff built Gravitate Coworking as a physical representation of the ecosystem.
Eric laid the foundation for NewBoCo to become a force across all stages and ages in Iowa.
And Tej Dhawan co-founded the Plains Angels network to invest in early stage companies in the region.
And The Greater Des Moines Partnership (aka — The Partnership) became a hub to unite the corporate, startup, small business, and artist communities in the city.
Iowa identified two cornerstone industries — AgTech + InsuranceTech — and developed a ton of industry-specific resources to build them up. So now organizations like AgVentures Alliance, Ag Startup Engine, BrokerTech Ventures, and the Global Insurance Accelerator serve as the backbone to clusters of these ventures. Iowa Startup Accelerator and Techstars Iowa Accelerator
Of course there are too many catalysts to properly name/cite here — so apologies in advance if someone is reading this and their contributions are not properly mentioned — but that’s the beauty of an ecosystem that’s rapidly catalyzing. At a certain point, the output becomes much greater than the sum of its parts. That’s where Des Moines’ entrepreneurial ecosystem resides right now.
Finally, I would be remiss to not touch on the wonderful people that make up the Startup Champions Network community.
Anika Horn — ecosystem builder extraordinaire — set the tone early by getting all the attendees in the mindset of sharing both what they can offer and what they are looking for in one-minute “speed dates”. Once these conversations started to flow, they were hard to stop.
One of the true pleasures of the Des Moines conference was having the opportunity to connect in both formal and casual settings to discuss the work that we do.
For example, after Day 1’s structured programming at Gravitate wrapped up, we each split into smaller groups for Dinner with Locals. This was an incredible opportunity to get a key player in the Des Moines entrepreneurial ecosystem over a meal. I had the pleasure of breaking bread with Craig Ibsen, a Managing Partner for Next Level Ventures, one of Iowa’s (and the region’s) largest venture firms.
Afterwards the good times continued to roll with a visit to Teehee’s Comedy Clubwhere club Co-Owner Sid Juwarker told the story of Des Moines’ developing comedy ecosystem, and emphasized the importance of supporting our own independent arts scene, no matter where we’re from. Otherwise, those artists might just move to Iowa.
The next morning we kicked off the day by attending Des Moines’ local 1 Million Cups (1MC) chapter — a Kauffman Foundation-enabled networking event that occurs in over 160 communities around the country every Wednesday morning. With the Iowa Cubs baseball stadium as a backdrop, we had the opportunity to learn from Iowa’s accelerator leaders about the role their programs play in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. And while this info was incredibly valuable, so was the opportunity to chat with and learn from the 100+ attendees in the more casual setting that it provided.
Last, but certainly not least, we ended Wednesday evening with a session called Roses & Thorns. This was an opportunity to break into smaller roundtables to have open and honest dialogue about our careers in ecosystem building. After all of the interpersonal interactions over the last two days, I came into this session truthfully not knowing what I would get out of it. I mean, hadn’t we already spoken about this at length? But I cannot adequately describe how impactful it was to have a venue to speak from the heart about what it’s like to work in this space.
The space created by our facilitator (shoutout to Fay Horwitt) set a vulnerable tone which led conversations to a place not possible in a larger group setting. I left that room feeling like I got out of a therapy session, feeling understood, rejuvenated, and even more passionate about the work I have ahead of me.
A common theme of the sessions is that we were finally among the people that understand all of the crazy work that we do. While our day-to-days may be different, the shared motivations and challenges served as a uniting force between us all.
So my appeal to any ecosystem builder reading this — please join us next Spring in Durham, NC March 1 -3, 2022 for what is sure to be another cathartic conference. The fantastic Fay Horwitt, CEO & President of Forward Cities, will be serving as the next Summit host.
My main takeaway from SCN Fall 2021?
Ecosystem building work is hard, but it’s even harder without a supportive community that is going through those same struggles.
SCN offers that community and enables you to be the best bridge you can be."
12,https://ecomap.tech/blog/ecomap-recap-techforward-2022,"EcoMap attended TechForward to learn about the impact connecting ecosystems can have within the non-profit space
TechForward, an annual conference by Tech Impact brings together non-profits and technologists to advance social impact.
We first heard of Tech Impact from one of their consultants who’d been supporting a non-profit’s evaluation of various tech solutions. And once we got wind of the conference we thought it was important to attend given that like Tech Impact, we intend to use technology to make ecosystems everywhere accessible to anyone. From our work so far we know that when ecosystems are made more accessible, outcomes become more equitable and efficient.
We believe that our technology helps to raise tides that lift all boats especially when combined with the incredible work of our customers who are building and empowering ecosystems all around the world.
The conference itself was incredibly inspiring and informative, kicked off by a powerful keynote message from Jasmine Crowe, CEO of Goodr, a sustainable waste management company.
One of the messages that stood out to me was how she responded to a question about competition. Goodr intends to end food insecurity but as a for-profit business competes with some non-profits who share the same mission. Essentially, Jasmine thoughtfully said that one company or one non-profit won’t be able to end food insecurity. The problem is big enough to require multiple approaches. She went on to say how they, at Goodr, actually collaborate with non-profits to better serve the community and customers. This resonated with me and the work we do at EcoMap because so much of it is centered around answering the question, “who is doing what” within any ecosystem.
We define an ecosystem as any combination of organizations, resources, and people and the activity or interaction between them. It begs the question, how much more effective would our communities be if we knew who was solving what problem and how they were actually going about solving that problem. How much better could we tackle food insecurity or affordable housing if there was a repository of all of the non-profits working on these challenges and the resources they offered to do so? We’d avoid duplicative efforts and unlock clearer ways to collaborate.
After Jasmine spoke, the plenary address was given by Marnie Webb, the Chief Community Impact Officer at TechSoup.
The talk eloquently drove that same point home… it mentioned that communities are built on connections and that better connections provide better opportunities. The question, though, is how do networks of these communities and connections emerge, strengthen, and sustain themselves. I’d argue that in order for those connected communities to emerge, strengthen, and sustain themselves we must be able to answer the question, “who is doing what” within an ecosystem. With that information, you can make better decisions on where to invest time, energy, and resources. With answers to that question you can more easily find partners and opportunities for collaboration. And we believe that with information that helps answer the question, “who is doing what” non-profits and communities alike
At its core, EcoMap connects ecosystem assets.
This could be like our work with the Maryland Entrepreneur Hub where we connect Entrepreneurs to Funding; or in Columbus, Ohio where we connect Small Business Owners to Grant Opportunities; or with Venture for America where we connect College Students to Job Opportunities. And so and so forth.
Like a map, you can use an EcoMap to discover and arrive at nearly any destination or connect with any resource in an ecosystem. And this is what many non-profits focus on; connecting stakeholders to the right resources to help them solve their problem which is exactly why we were excited to attend the TechForward Conference in Denver, Colorado.
And because we already work with large non-profits like Venture for America and the Aspen Institute, we wanted to see if there would be additional opportunities for us to support other non-profits by mapping their ecosystems.
We learned that there are lots of ways we can help.

13,https://ecomap.tech/blog/ecomap-recap-ueda-summit-2022,"The EcoMap team recaps their experience at the 2022 University Economic Development Association (UEDA) Summit in San Antonio
They say “everything is bigger in Texas” and the recent University Economic Development Association (UEDA) annual conference was no exception.
Hosted in San Antonio - the 7th largest city in the country - UEDA brought together hundreds of stakeholders from university, industry, and government to discuss the role of each in the innovation ecosystem.
As Chancellor of the University of Texas System James B. Milliken paraphrased during his remarks, “Nothing important happens without university, industry, and government at the table”. UEDA serves as a great convener to bring that triumverate to the table to share best practice and give its members a toolkit to spur economic development in their respective communities.
The EcoMap team was honored to attend its first UEDA this past week and play a role in the conference as both a speaker and sponsor. As a fairly new startup with university roots, EcoMap felt right at home with the academics and economic developers that made their way to UEDA.
As with any conference, it is impossible to capture the full scope of the sessions, learnings, and conversations that took place over UEDA. But this EcoMap ReCap is our takeaway from the 4 days of university-inspired economic development down in San Antonio.
Kicking off the conference on Sunday was the “ARENI” (pronounced Are-Knee) Economic Accelerator Day.
The American Resilience & Equity Networks Initiative (aka ARENI) took root last summer when UEDA won a grant from the Economic Development Administration (EDA). What is ARENI hoping to accomplish? Well, I’ll let the program description speak for itself.
[ARENI] provides a structure for region-to-region collaboration on resilience and equity issues and EDA’s University Centers through regular convenings, online forums, and resource libraries. Using UEDA’s existing criterion for identifying best practices in higher education economic development, methods will be identified and then evaluated by an Advisory Council on originality, scalability, sustainability, impact, and replicability in other regions. Those methods that favorably meet the criteria will be elevated to present to the appropriate network.
In order to live up to that mission, UEDA convened a superstar lineup of folks involved across a series of federal government agencies, equity-focused non-profits, and HBCUs/MSIs.
The Keynote for that day was delivered by Dr. Rhonda Vonshay Sharpe - the President of the Women’s Institute for Science, Equity and Race (WISER). That acronym certainly fit as Dr. Sharpe shared a ton of wise, data-backed insights on equitable policies that could be implemented that have a focus on the “other DEI” - Development, Economics, and Innovation.
Afterwards, there was a panel of HBCU leaders across historic institutions such as Norfolk State, Alabama A&M, and Stillman College who spoke about the initiatives and efforts they’ve undertaken to ensure economic resilience among their communities. A key theme involved taking advantage of government opportunities such as building up contractor capacity among the institution’s stakeholders and utilizing opportunity zones as an economic catalyst.
Finally, UEDA convened a panel of federal government leaders across some marquee three letter agencies, including the EDA, SBA, DOE, and NSF. My main takeaway from this session? The federal government has never been so focused on building up an equitable innovation ecosystem across the country. To underscore the point, Dr. Thyaga Nandagopal - a division director in the newly created Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships (TIP) Directorate - highlighted the Regional Innovation Engines program which is putting in hundreds of millions of dollars to foster partnerships across industry, academia, government, nonprofits, civil society, and communities of practice. Many attendees in the crowd have applied to the inaugural “Type 1” grant.
One of our personal highlights of the conference came early on Day 2 when our Co-Founder/CEO Pava LaPere presented a workshop titled ‘Techniques for Mapping Your Entrepreneurial Ecosystem’ to a packed house.
With a room full of university and economic development practitioners, Pava led a fast-paced, info-filled session which detailed EcoMap’s foundation as a university-based startup seeking to solve its own problem: finding access to the resources it needed in order to succeed.
Over the last 4 years, EcoMap has transformed from a student-led research project to a venture-backed startup. Along the way, we have learned a lot about how to conduct ecosystem mapping exercises across a wide variety of ecosystems - whether they be entrepreneurial, demographic, academic, industrial, or some hybrid.
Why did we propose this specific session for this kind of crowd?
Mapping your institution’s entrepreneurial ecosystem is critical for building a center that’s inclusive and serves the needs of your community.
However, the mapping process can be confusing and resource-intensive. This session was meant to equip attendees with mapping strategies and highlight how good ecosystem maps can make centers more accessible & resource-efficient.
If you are interested in viewing the highly informative slide deck used for this presentation, you can access it here.
Unfortunately our recording device ran out of memory 3/4ths of the way through the session so … you’ll just have to find Pava and ask her to give you the full workshop in person.
Throughout the conference, UEDA hosted various Awards of Excellence sessions to celebrate the finalists across 5 categories:
During these sessions, the finalists would have 12 minutes to pitch their university’s program that led them to be finalists for the awards along with a 5 minute audience Q&A.
Then the power came down to the crowd.
As an audience member for a handful of these sessions, I have to say, it was incredibly tough to distinguish between the various degrees of excellence. All of these programs were clearly finalists for a region. I do have to say I appreciate the incorporation of Ranked-Choice Voting which made it slightly less painful to choose.
At closing Economic Excellence Banquet, UEDA honored the winners of each of these awards and I just wanted to amplify that with another shoutout below. Here are your winners!
With all of the buzz around university-involved entrepreneurial ecosystems and ways to catalyze them, our EcoMap team felt right at home.
Conferences like UEDA offer a ton of value for its attendees to not only learn from how they are operating at their institutions across the country, but to have the intimate conversations that just can’t happen virtually.
To that end, I wanted to quickly highlight some (not all) events/interactions that I will take home with me from San Antonio.
Can’t wait to see new and familiar faces next year at the 2023 UEDA Summit hosted by the University of Utah in Salt Lake City!"

EcoMap Technologies creates platforms that help people navigate ecosystems, from local business communities to entire industries and beyond. Ecosystems - networks of organizations, resources, people, and the relationships between them - make up the core of our personal and professional life. Unfortunately, these ecosystems are largely invisible, inaccessible, and inefficient, because data about what is going on in the ecosystem is decentralized and ever-changing. Because of this, it is incredibly hard to answer basic questions like “who is doing what?” or “what is going on?” within any ecosystem. At EcoMap, we use technology to make easy for anyone to navigate any ecosystem, anywhere.
We're a rapidly growing tech company proudly located in Baltimore, Maryland. Our team of 16+ is made up of ecosystem builders, data nerds, and technologists who are passionate about making the information around us more accessible to everyone.

15,https://ecomap.tech/blog/ecomap-technologies-closes-3-5m-seed-round,"Baltimore, Md (June 7, 2022) – EcoMap Technologies, a Baltimore-based start-up that creates platforms that help people navigate ecosystems, is excited to announce that it has closed a $3.5M seed round led by Las Olas Venture Capital.
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
EcoMaps are data-driven platforms that centralize information about the organizations, resources, people, and activity within any given ecosystem into a one-stop online hub. EcoMap platforms make it possible to easily navigate any ecosystem, including local business communities, entire industries, and even corporate networks.
“Although ecosystems exist everywhere, the tools on the market today lack the functionality and flexibility to encompass the complexity of ecosystem management. EcoMap fills this gap. Their technology transforms traditionally static, inaccessible, and fragmented data points into a singular platform that encompasses the entire breadth of ecosystem activities, automatically updates with new data, and enables organizations to implement the features they want,” shared Las Olas Venture Capital Partner Nate Vasel, who led the deal and is joining the board as part of this round.
He adds, “Pava and Sherrod deeply understand the customer problem in ecosystem building, and even at this stage EcoMap has seen incredible customer love for the product. We at LOVC are thrilled to be working with them.”
EcoMaps centralize information about the organizations, resources, and other assets within a community into a continually-updated platform, so that anyone can easily navigate what is going on, find the resources they need, and connect with new partners.
According to EcoMap Technologies CEO Pava LaPere, “Ecosystems make up the core of our personal and professional life. Unfortunately, these ecosystems are largely invisible, inaccessible, and inefficient, because data about what is going on in the ecosystem is decentralized and ever-changing. At EcoMap, we use technology to make easy for anyone to navigate any ecosystem, anywhere.”
Investors in the seed round include Janus Venture Partners, GroTech Ventures, Conscious Venture Partners, TCP Venture Capital, TechStars and other local partners.
“While we were able to secure investments from an impressive group of funders, we are particularly proud of the number of investors from our hometown of Baltimore. We are passionately committed to making an impact on the city, and we are proud to be part of its growing tech ecosystem. This funding will allow us to focus on growth and increasing our market share – we want to develop EcoMaps for ecosystems in a wide range of industries and communities,” states LaPere.
EcoMap has created maps for more than a dozen ecosystems including tech ecosystems in Baltimore, Virginia and Long Beach City; Venture for America’s ecosystem of alumni in 13 states; as well as business ecosystems in Dallas, Charlottesville, VA, Columbus, OH, and Upstate, SC.
Maps have been created for diverse ecosystems including the Native American business ecosystem; Ghana’s entrepreneurial ecosystem; and the Baltimore black-owned business ecosystem.
“We needed an online hub that would help our organization share information and connect stakeholders across more than thirteen cities. The EcoMap team not only understood the breadth of our ecosystem, but also suggested solutions, and advanced our build from ideation to implementation effortlessly,"" stated Eric Somerville, Chief Executive Officer at Venture for America.
A majority of the funding will be used for hiring key roles in marketing, sales, and product development.
LaPere founded EcoMap Technologies when she was a 21-year old college student attending Johns Hopkins University, with her co-founder Sherrod Davis. EcoMap Technologies is a graduate of the TechStars Equitech Accelerator. The female- and black-founded company has a diverse team with a 50/50 goal – currently, half of its employees are female and 30% are people of color."
16,https://ecomap.tech/blog/ecomaps-maryland-entrepreneur-hub-wins-2022-meda-economic-development-marketing-award,"EcoMap Technologies is thrilled to learn of the Maryland Entrepreneur Hub’s selection as the 2022 winner of the Economic Development Marketing award for a Large Community from the Maryland Economic Development Association (MEDA).
The MEDA Awards, sponsored by Miles & Stockbridge P.C., recognize the people, programs, and projects bringing economic prosperity to Maryland.
We are honored to have been nominated for this award by the Maryland Department of Commerce in partnership with the Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO), and the University System of Maryland (USM) - our three partners that collaborated to bring this Hub to life.
Instead of droning on and on about what we think makes this platform special, we’ll let our partners within Maryland do the talking.
“When folks want to know about the Maryland Entrepreneur Hub, I tell them it’s a single resource where you can find out the most information about things happening in Maryland for entrepreneurs” - Lindsay Ryan, Venture Development Director for the University System of Maryland
The Maryland Entrepreneur Hub creates that “one-stop resource” where you can get answers to questions and connections to different organizations (also knowing about events as well). - Anne Balduzzi, Managing Director of Entrepreneur and Ecosystem Empowerment for TEDCO
Any entrepreneur [in Maryland] can benefit from this platform because when I talk to somebody and they start asking me questions about resources and I can just point them here, they are absolutely delighted because they have so much information. And it frees up me and other people on my team to help more people. - Allyson Redpath, Director of Entrepreneurship for the Maryland Department of Commerce
We partnered with EcoMap because their solution was unique, and unique in the respect that it actually goes out and scours the internet using Artificial Intelligence to continually update the resource information that’s on the site, as well as finding new resource information. And through that AI - as the AI gets trained - it improves over time. But that’s what really helped to keep that information robust and up-to-date. - Anne
Even though this is automated, there are ways that member of the community can update it - and I think that’s actually really important. Every week there are changes - someone is updated and improving the Maryland Entrepreneur Hub. - Lindsay
I think in general its a terrific example of our three organizations working together to do something that I don’t think we could’ve done individually. - Allyson
Well there you have it - the reasons why EcoMap's largest platform is an award winner for Maryland. We are honored to play a role in helping Maryland's entrepreneurs find the resources they need to succeed and are committed to making all ecosystems as accessible as our home state's.

17,https://ecomap.tech/blog/ecosystem-grants-february-2023,"The federal government is serving up hundreds of millions of dollars for ecosystem builders this year - here are three opportunities to put on your radar for February 2023
Here at EcoMap, we know how critical sources of funding are to the longevity of ecosystem building initiatives. Whether it’s to provide physical infrastructure like space or digital infrastructure like ecosystem mapping tools (cough cough), these initiatives take time, money, and stakeholder buy-in in order to live up to their full potential.
And funding is often the critical piece of that trio that is missing in order to execute the plan.
One such source of funding that should not be overlooked is federal funding opportunities. The U.S. government has provided a couple of billion ($) in funding opportunities for ecosystem builders over the past couple of years, highlighted by initiatives like the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Community Navigator Pilot program, the Economic Development Agency’s (EDA) Build to Scale program, and the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Regional Innovation Engines Program - just to name a few.
But the influx of federal funding for ecosystem building doesn’t appear to be stopping anytime soon. More and more funding has been appropriated for 2023 with the ultimate goal to further build regional innovation economies across the country. And there is a growing emphasis on providing funding opportunities as an effective incentive to get ecosystem builders in a similar region/mission to actually collaborate with one another.
As Ryan Buscaglia and Melissa Roberts Chapman put it in their article Cluster Development is the New Economic Development:
… 2022 was a record year for place-based policies. From the EDA’s $1 billion Build Back Better Regional Challenge (BBBRC) awards to the NSF’s TIP Directorate and Engines program, it is clear that developing geographically and technically diverse clusters is front of mind. A welcome surprise tucked into the end of year Omnibus spending bill was more than $750 million for the EDA to launch further place-based grant programs that invest in communities across the United States.
That’s why we are compiling federal funding opportunities that are relevant for ecosystem builders of all backgrounds.
To kick off this series, we’ve identified three such opportunities that ecosystem builders can apply for within the month of February.
Whether you’re supporting higher education, translational research, or rural entrepreneurial ecosystems - there is something for everybody this upcoming month. And if one of these opportunities doesn’t apply to your work, please be sure to share it with a friend!
Without further ado, let’s dive in.

18,https://ecomap.tech/blog/ecosystem-grants-march-2023,"Check out these grants geared for ecosystem builders in March 2023 for the opportunity to get hundreds of thousands in capacity building support
As we look at the calendar today ... how the heck is it already March? It feels like just yesterday I was accidentally still writing 2022̶3 and now we're two months into the not-so-new year.
Last month was also a hectic one for ecosystem grant opportunities, with three big deadlines across three agencies:
March is a little lighter on agency-provided grants, as there are no current opportunities open for ecosystem builders from the SBA or EDA. However, the NSF keeps churning out new opportunities to bolster regional innovation ecosystems and we have found some great fits for folks supporting inclusive entrepreneurship in the Bay Area, Native American communities, and regional translational research.

19,https://ecomap.tech/blog/how-ghana-uses-ecomap-to-support-its-entrepreneurial-ecosystem,"Joshua Adedeji is the Regional Head of the Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs (ANDE) West Africa. He was one of the driving forces behind Ghana’s implementation of an EcoMap platform with the goal of creating deeper connections within their community.
Joshua Adedeji is the Regional Head of the Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs (ANDE) West Africa. He was one of the driving forces behind Ghana’s implementation of an EcoMap platform with the goal of creating deeper connections within their community.
Joshua joined the West Africa Chapter of ANDE in September 2016 to further pursue his passion for international development, social entrepreneurship and sustainability. He is currently based out of Lagos, Nigeria.
As Ghana’s economy began to see growth from its entrepreneurial sector, severe infrastructure issues became evident. According to Joshua, the biggest problem was inaccessible information:
“Everyone was operating in silos, and no one knew who was doing what. Entrepreneurs complained that there were no investors and investors were complaining that there were no entrepreneurs to invest in”.
It became clear that there was no interconnection between the critical pieces of the ecosystem.
The solution seemed obvious; Ghana needed to store its ecosystem’s data and information in a centralized location. The execution, however, proved no easy task.
The first attempt at a solution was a series of comprehensive PDF files containing all of the ecosystem’s data. The PDFs quickly became unmanageable because of how frequently the data of an ecosystem changes.
Organizations and programs were continuously coming into existence or going extinct. Any process requiring manual updates to the information was not adequate for storing such dynamic data.
After the PDFs proved to be ineffective, an ANDE representative reached out to EcoMap Tech in search of a new solution. Luckily, it turned out to be just what they needed.
All EcoMap platforms automatically update and refresh information. This feature allows Joshua and his team to review data in real-time.
Additionally, the EcoMap consolidates previously fragmented resources and makes them easy to find based on individual needs. Entrepreneurial support organizations (ESOs) from around the world use the platform to identify opportunities and gaps in Ghana’s market.
Based on the insights gathered from the EcoMap, the ESOs can spot collaboration opportunities and create new programs to fill the gaps.
“The ecomap is very useful to the ecosystem in Ghana; it allows us to understand the ecosystem and make the information available to the public”, said Joshua.
Public response to the platform has been fantastic. Some of the ecosystem’s key players have noted significant improvements among entrepreneurial culture, connectivity of ecosystem organizations, and the amount of technical assistance.
One notable gap in Ghana’s ecosystem that has improved since launching the EcoMap was the loan facilitation market. Previously, Ghana’s entrepreneurs were subjected to predatory loans, with interest rates as high as 35% and required payments of 3 years upfront.
With the EcoMap, Ghanaian entrepreneurs now have access to more loan options with favorable terms, and interest rates as low as 10%. Some loans even include coworking spaces and free internet access.
Entrepreneurs also have access to a clear snapshot of over 200 resources and support Organizations. They can find investors, accelerators, and other support organizations for each business stage: startup, early, growth, and mature."
20,https://ecomap.tech/blog/introducing-ecomaps-newest-leaders,"We're so excited to welcome three new members to the EcoMap leadership team - John as Head of Sales, Joyce as Head of Marketing, and Amira as Head of Customer Success
One of the best pieces of advice I got as a young CEO is that you must defend the quality of your team at all costs. You have to learn how to recruit diverse candidates, vet them on both abstract & concrete skills, and integrate them into a job that changes constantly as the company grows. However important, these skills are hard learned, and often through painful iteration. So when we were reveling in the close of our latest financing, I knew that the hardest part was to come: hiring the 8 people who will make EcoMap’s next growth phase possible.
Thanks to the excellent work of our Head of People Operations and the vibrant culture we’ve created among our existing team, we’re thrilled today to announce three of those new team members: our Head of Sales, John Schnelle; our Head of Customer Success, Amira Crawford; and our Head of Strategic Marketing, Joyce Arias. Each of these amazing individuals have joined EcoMap’s leadership team to drive our company through our next phase of growth (and lead the 5 additional team members we’ll be announcing in early August 🤭).
As with all valuable assets, we wanted to take a moment to share with the world the amazing backgrounds of each of these team members and the reasons why we are so excited to have them join our company
We were originally connected with John through Kory Bailey of Upsurge and Sammy Popat at UMD. To receive such high words of praise from two of Maryland’s top ecosystem builders and hyper connectors, we figured John must be special - and we were right.
Beyond his 15 years of experience in sales at startups and technology companies, the first thing that struck me about John was how he lit up a room - even if that room was just a Zoom call. John’s energy and experience made it clear he would be a great fit for scaling EcoMap’s sales team, but what truly got our attention was his passion for ecosystems.
Currently in Boston, John is excited about moving to Baltimore with his family at a time when our entrepreneurial ecosystem is at a crucial inflection point - when each person joining Charm City’s tech community plays a key role in driving Baltimore’s growth as an Equitech hub. We already know that John’s experience, energy, and insights will be vital to EcoMap’s growth, and we know it will play a key part in Baltimore’s tech community as well.
Going into my interview with Joyce, I knew she had extensive experience with many aspects of marketing - from a flawlessly designed resume to an impressive background spearheading marketing at companies like Whitebox and Barcoding, Inc, it was clear Joyce was well qualified to lead EcoMap’s marketing initiatives.
What I didn’t know was all of the insane entrepreneurial experience she held in her back pocket.
From starting her own marketing consultancy that worked with clients including Berkshire Hathaway & Pandora, to founding her own cosmetic line that made it into InStyle Magazine a short time after launch, to creating a her own podcast, Joyce has the entrepreneurial drive that we love in leaders at EcoMap. But beyond her penchant for entrepreneurship, Joyce is passionate about other topics close to our heart: diversity in business, the importance of storytelling, and of course, Baltimore. We could not be more excited to work with Joyce to launch EcoMap’s Marketing Division.
EcoMap is blessed to have a wide range of customers, from 3-person nonprofits to Fortune 100 companies. While the applicability of the EcoMap platform to so many types of ecosystems is one of our core strengths as a business, it also makes certain roles on our team very hard - and Head of Customer Success is definitely one of those.
Thankfully, that’s where Amira comes in. Amira has over 15 years of experience in managing teams, creating processes, and designing customer success systems - notably in education & EdTech, where multiple stakeholders, complex policies, and layers of bureaucracy are the norm. It was clear from the offset that the myriad of organizations that EcoMap serves would be no problem in the face of her insights and experience.
Beyond an impressive background at companies such as Blackboard and a Masters of Science in Education from Johns Hopkins, what was most exciting to me about Amira was her direct, strategic, and no-nonsense attitude. As a young company learning as we grow, having her steady hand to scale our Customer Success division will be critical as we continue to onboard more and more customers to the EcoMap network every day.
-----
We are so excited to welcome John, Joyce, and Amira to the EcoMap team - but our growth doesn't stop there. In a few weeks, we’ll be announcing the start of even more EcoMappers, including Product Marketers, Account Executives, and RevOps & Customer Success Associates. Stay tuned to learn about the other amazing people joining our team - and if you want to chat with any of them, you can schedule time to do so here."
21,https://ecomap.tech/blog/launch-of-the-entrepreneurship-usc-ecomap-platform,"Members of the USC entrepreneurial ecosystem have a new hub to understand all of the resources and organizations around them
As USC students return for the Spring ‘23 semester, they will have a new resource to help them navigate the university’s ever-expanding innovation ecosystem.
EcoMap had the pleasure of teaming up with the University of Southern California’s Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies to launch EntrepreneurshipUSC.net - a platform designed to connect students with the resources and organizations they need to turn their ideas into reality.
One of the biggest challenges for students at any university is figuring out where to go for help and support. With so many different organizations and resources available, it can be overwhelming to know where to start. That's where this EcoMap platform comes in. Entrepreneurship USC is designed to help students discover and connect with the resources and organizations that are most relevant to their needs and goals.
A key benefit of using this platform is that it helps students save time and energy by bringing all of the relevant resources and organizations together in one place. Rather than having to search through multiple websites or ask around to find what they need, students can simply log into the platform and find all the innovation-related info they need in one place. This includes:
But the Entrepreneurship USC platform isn't just a directory – it's also a community. By joining the platform, you'll be able to connect with other students who are passionate about innovation and entrepreneurship. This is a great way to share ideas, get feedback, and find support for your ventures.
If you're a student at the University of Southern California, we encourage you to sign up for an account on Entrepreneurship USC and start exploring all that it has to offer. Whether you're just starting out on your entrepreneurial journey or you're an experienced innovator looking for new opportunities, this platform has something for everyone.
Overall, the USC Innovation Navigator is a valuable resource for any student looking to get involved in the innovation ecosystem at USC.
Whether you're just starting out or you're an experienced entrepreneur, the Navigator has something to offer.
So why wait? Start exploring the Navigator today and see what it can do for you!"
22,https://ecomap.tech/blog/meet-ecomap-technologies,"With all the buzz around our company lately, we figured it was time we formally introduced EcoMap Tech
& we're on a mission to make ecosystems accessible at scale. We're typically quiet about our work and growth, but between launching in 5 new ecosystems in two weeks, the Techstars Equitech Demo Day, and our founders speaking at conferences across the country, EcoMap Tech is about to get a lot of attention.
While we're thrilled that so many people align with our goal of connecting every ecosystem, everywhere, for everyone, we also know not everyone is familiar with ecosystems, what they are, or why they matter. And despite being around for a while, we realized we haven’t introduced our company to most of you, either.
If you’re wondering what ecosystems are, why they're vital, and how technology can make them more accessible & stronger at scale -
- we're here to share what we've learned mapping a bunch of them, including tech hubs, small business communities, identity networks, and even entire industries. If we do our job and this is helpful, we'll be sharing more across our website and socials - check our LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.
Let’s start with ecosystems - and not the green type. Instead, we’re talking about what people mean when they say Miami’s Tech Ecosystem, the Columbus Small Business Ecosystem, or the Web3 Ecosystem You probably hear these phrases all the time... but what is an ecosystem?
Ecosystems are interconnected networks of organizations, resources, & people working towards a common goal or sharing a common identity
There are a few additions to this soundbite definition. Ecosystems contain more than just people, resources, and organizations - there’s also events, jobs, news, and other activity. Likewise, ecosystems aren't always working together - many are siloed, where there’s little collaboration between groups. To be honest, it's hard for ecosystems to not be siloed, since it’s hard to keep track of who is doing what in the ecosystem. More on that later.
Most importantly, ecosystems are everywhere - they are our local business communities, industry sectors, and corporate networks. What’s amazing is that despite their variety - in makeup, size, or stage - all ecosystems are made of the same parts: a mix of organizations doing different things, for different audiences, with different methods - but for a shared reason.
The goals of ecosystems are as diverse as they are: creating a vibrant Main Street community, making a city the next hotbed for tech, launching a new industry (looking at you, NFTs), or making sure everyone can access local resources - ecosystems are united by the goals of those working within them.
Yet despite their importance, ecosystems are often invisible & inaccessible - so how do people navigate them? That’s where EcoMaps come in.
Formally, EcoMap stands for, well, Ecosystem Map. I could tell you we named our company for the perfect URL or the trifecta of syllables, but really, EcoMap was the label that fit on the Google Drive folder containing 1,000s of hours of research into ecosystems that we did before starting the company.
In that research, we looked at ecosystems across the world to figure out how people answer the question “who is doing what” in a given ecosystem. Our work found that even though so many organizations wanted a tool that helped people navigate their ecosystem, it remained incredibly hard to create good ecosystem platforms.
Why? Because it takes a ton of time to gather, tag, and standardize information about the organizations, resources, events, jobs, news, people, etc within even a small community. Once you get all that data, you have to find a way to keep it updated as the ecosystem changes - and they change all the time. On top of that, communities had to either shell out $300k+ for a custom website, or settle for off-the-shelf software that doesn't fit their specific needs.
We realized there had to be a better way to create platforms for ecosystems, so we spent years developing technology to do it (that’s the Tech of EcoMap.Tech). We built processes to easily gather ecosystem data, algorithms to keep it continually up to date, and platforms that dynamically adapt to the design, language, and needs of each unique ecosystem.
We created the EcoMap - a data-driven platform that allows people to navigate, engage with, and understand the ecosystems around them.
EcoMaps centralize information about the organizations, resources, and other assets within a community into a continually-updated platform, so that anyone can easily navigate what is going on, find the resources they need, and connect with new partners. Our platforms power dozens of ecosystems, from small arts communities to entire industries, for organizations ranging from small nonprofits to Fortune 100 & FAANG companies.
EcoMappers are the fearless team members leading the charge of using technology to build more accessible ecosystems across the world. Our team is a diverse group of technologists, data nerds, economic developers, and ecosystem builders united by a common goal:
To make information more accessible to everyone, in every ecosystem, everywhere.
We can’t build a stronger future if we don’t understand who is building in the present. If we can’t answer “Who is doing what?” and make that information accessible to everyone, we cant properly leverage the assets within our ecosystems to achieve our goals: thriving communities, equitable growth, and stronger networks.
EcoMap Tech is a 16 person company (and growing - if you like our work and/or are an active user of the #pets Slack, we’d love to talk) located in the heart of our favorite ecosystem, Baltimore, MD. In short, the EcoMappers are the people who make the EcoMap possible, which makes it possible for tens of thousands of people to navigate ecosystems all over the world. You can learn more about us here.
Honestly, a lot. While we’re proud of the growth we've experienced, it’s been a wild ride. Not only have our platforms spread across the country like wildfire, our tech has transformed day by day, and our team has grown rapidly to keep up with it all. Our ecosystem has changed a ton (maybe we should make an EcoMap of it...)
Over the next few months, our team will be presenting at half a dozen conferences to talk about EcoMap Tech, ecosystem building, and why this work matters more than ever (we’ll share our schedule when we have it - we’d love to meet fellow ecosystem builders!).
Over the next few weeks, we’re excited to announce the launches of new EcoMap platforms, adding to our ever-growing Ecosystem of Ecosystems. We’ll update this post with links once our partners are ready to go live:
Once things settle down, we’re excited to share with recent & upcoming improvements to our technology, the data we curate, and the interconnectedness of the EcoMap Ecosystem of Ecosystems. If you are not signed up for updates, you can do so here.
Thanks for taking the time to learn about our company, technology, team, and most importantly, our vision of building more connected ecosystems everywhere. If you would like to learn more, you can email our team, schedule a demo of our technology, or contact our founders, Pava & Sherrod."
23,https://ecomap.tech/blog/the-black-butterfly-network-connections-on-a-deeper-level,"Paulo Gregory is a man who doesn’t like labels. If you were to ask him what he did for a living, you likely wouldn’t get the same answer twice.
If you were to ask him what he did for a living, you likely wouldn’t get the same answer twice. But, if you had to find a word that could sum up Paulo, “creator” or “connector” may be the best fit.
The truth is Paulo is a highly creative individual who has visions about how the world should look. As an inventor, community leader, artist, and musician, he uses his creative skills to bring those visions into reality.
Among the many different aspects of Paulo, a common thread intertwines them all: his intuitive knowledge for facilitating deep and personal connections. That thread is apparent in his long and successful career as a strategic development consultant, and you can find it once more in the board game he invented called Cohado.
The name Cohado came from an old Zulu word, meaning “the long sustainable view.” The game is, in some ways, a microcosm of Paulo himself. Cohado is a design structure game similar to dominos, with 28 pieces and seven symbols. However, unlike dominos, where players compete against each other, Cohado players work together to connect their pieces into “assets” in the most efficient way possible. The seven symbols represent vision, viewpoint, relationship, creativity, structure, manifestation, and community, the foundational principles of strategic design and community building.
Another area of Paulo’s work that seems to mirror the gameplay of Cohado is his involvement with Black Butterfly Network, an ESHIP Communities program spun out of ecosystem building organization Forward Cities, designed to connect black business owners in Baltimore to support organizations and business resources.
Paulo first became involved with the program in 2017, when it was still just an idea. Then, in collaboration with other stakeholders, he helped bring the concept to life. When COVID hit, Paulo and Startup Maryland conducted a series of interviews with black-owned restaurants and retail stores in Baltimore to uncover the pain points of the city’s black entrepreneurs. It became overwhelmingly clear that the business owners needed access to information and resources and a more robust support network of peers. And a little over a year later, the first Black Butterfly Cohort officially launched this past October.
In late 2021, EcoMap built the program’s digital counterpart, The Black Butterfly Exchange.
The platform provides black business owners across the city with “free resources, educational materials, one-on-one support, and an ever-growing business directory.”
The EcoMap platform highlights over 200 businesses, gives access to over 450 resources and is customized to reflect the values of the community and pay tribute to Zulu culture. EcoMap’s highly customizable platform design and the team’s ability to empathize with the community’s problem made a lasting impression on Paulo.
According to Paulo, the choice to go with EcoMap was an easy one: “we would not have been able to [customize the platform] with a competitor to match the vibe we were trying to convey.” He also added, “when people see the Black Butterfly Exchange, they love it!.” Paulo and the Baltimore ESHIP Stewardship Council Members are excited to use this platform, created with EcoMap, to support the growing Black Butterfly network in Baltimore.
“Ubuntu” is another insightful Zulu word at the crux of Paulo’s philosophy; it means we are responsible for each other’s well-being. Unfortunately, it is not a principle that is typically found in entrepreneurship.
Historically, Black business owners are significantly underrepresented in Baltimore. As Paulo described it, “Ascendent cultures, those structurally forced to the bottom of the economic pyramid, are the last to receive vital information about grants, funding, and other necessary resources to help businesses prosper.” Only a few can win when the top of the hierarchy plays dominoes.
So, maybe it’s time we all put down the dominoes and start a game of Cohado."
24,https://ecomap.tech/blog/what-ecomaps-expansion-means-for-our-customers,"EcoMap recently brought in substantial capital resources to help us make EcoMap even better - here is what our expansion means for our customers
At EcoMap, we envision a world where every ecosystem, everywhere is accessible to everyone. This vision becomes a reality when we effectively support our customers in making their ecosystems accessible to everyone. All of our customers share in and are the most critical part of our work. Whether you are an entrepreneurial ecosystem builder in a small town or a leader of a large non-profit or enterprise, EcoMap can help you grow and understand your ecosystem and that remains our focus moving forward.
Most of our customers come to us because we enable them to build an online reflection of their ecosystem without significant time or cost burdens. EcoMaps act as digital front doors so that our customers can let people into their ecosystem more easily, growing it more quickly and with better engagement using data and information to build relationships with the folks in their ecosystems.
In order for us to hasten the pace by which accessible ecosystems becomes a reality, the EcoMap team decided to get more resources in the form of venture capital funding. Which is why we are so excited to announce that we have closed a rapidly oversubscribed $3.5M seed round. Thank you to all of our current and future customers who helped us get to this point. We know that the work is just beginning but also recognize you all, our customers, as THE reason for our success. Our focus now is on executing against all the feedback our customers have shared and ensuring that we have technology and processes in place to support hundreds more with the same attention, focus, and flexibility that we offered our first few customers.
We’re constantly working to make our platforms more engaging and user-friendly. This funding will allow us to keep making improvements on our platforms over time to ensure your users are getting the most possible value out of the information housed in your platform. Check out some of our newest platform features here.
With the capital injection, we'll bolster our data. offering, quicker access to local, regional, and national data sets made easier to navigate for you and your users with EcoMap’s technology. Want national resources for black entrepreneurs or regional support organizations that focus on women? With these resources, more expansive data and information will enable our customers to offer a more robust online ecosystem experience.
For our customers and their users, this means that they’ll have more efficient ways of communicating with the EcoMap team and that we’ll have better systems in place to address their comments. This also means they’ll have more resources to understand the power of the EcoMap platform and how to best configure it to meet their specific ecosystem needs. Think a resource library where you can quickly find answers to your questions and how-to-guides and best practices to manage your EcoMap.
When our customers launch an EcoMap, they often have two goals: support the current stakeholders in their ecosystem, and attract new people to all their ecosystem has to offer. We want to be sure that as many people know about your platform as possible so that this can be done most effectively. We'll be creating a Product Marketing Team with an exclusive focus of promotion each EcoMap platform and supporting our customers marketing efforts. This means more exposure, usage, and community-generated data for all of our current and future customers.
We are so excited about what we can accomplish together. Thank you for trusting us with your ecosystem. It’s a responsibility we take seriously and are very grateful for.

77,https://ecomap.tech/product,"The first platform built to power any ecosystem, from a single organization to an entire industry
EcoMap uses proprietary technology to gather, clean, tag, and update information about your ecosystem, including core organizations, resources, opportunities, activity, and relationships. All data is reviewed by our expert data team to ensure it is accurate, robust, and updatedExplore More Features →
We start by deeply understanding your ecosystem and what you want your platform to do, and then we curate the most applicable data
All data in your EcoMap are tagged with a set of Keywords, allowing users to easily filter it, and admins to analyze the dataset with ease
We monitor your ecosystem for new data that should be added, and we review all existing data for broken links, new dates, and other changes
We're ecosystem people, so we know that the needs of an ecosystem can change quickly. That's why every feature on EcoMap can be turned on or off at any time, allowing your platform to always meet the needs of your organization or stakeholdersExplore More Features →
Directories allow users to search and filter through organizations, resources, people, jobs, events, news, and other data in your ecosystem
Profile pages provide more details about any given thing, such as a community member, a resource, or a job opportunity
Features such as Guides, Lists, Keyword Hubs, and Program Management provide other ways for people to navigate your data
Every ecosystem is unique, so the platform that represents it should be unique as well. EcoMaps are entirely white-labeled for your organization or community, and you can customize the user experience for different groups of stakeholdersExplore More Features →
Change your platform's features, photos, language, and filters at any time, with ease. Want to change the colors or fonts? Just ask.
Set up a different onboarding experience, dashboard, and feature views for different types of stakeholders in your community
Only want some people to access some parts of your platform? Set custom permissions for who can view pages, add data, and more
Whether you're trying to bring together a community, provide personalized support to members of your ecosystem, or strengthen your workforce, EcoMap offers advanced feature packages to address every need.
EcoMap is the only platform on the market that can curate accurate, detailed, & updated data about any type of ecosystem - from city tech hubs, to private networks, to entire industries.
This means that you get to focus on what matters - understanding, engaging, and promoting your ecosystem. Not gathering and updating data.
Modern ecosystems are complex networks of people, organizations, resources, opportunity, and the activity and relationships between them. Ecosystems are Everywhere.
From small business communities, to industries, to corporate networks, all ecosystems share the same challenges around information access. Our platforms are built to address the unique needs of ecosystems and the organizations that grow, engage, and understand them.
This might be silly to include in a ""Why We're Better"" section, but we mean it. EcoMap was the first platform built to power ecosystems, and our customers love it, but we know we can always do better.
This means that we never stop innovating - from improving the appearance of our platforms, to creating more powerful data curation technology, to developing advanced features, our 30+ person team never stops working to bring our customers the best-in-class ecosystem platform."

People, resources, organizations, oh my! Learn more about the Assets that make up every ecosystem
People, resources, organizations, oh my! Learn more about the Assets that make up every ecosystem
Ecosystems are made up of different ""things"", including People, Organizations, Resources, Opportunities, and Activities. These ""things"" are called Assets, and they are the building blocks of every ecosystem
Lumping everything that could exist within an ecosystem under the term ""Asset"" may seem counterintuitive - after all, there are meaningful differences between human people, giant corporations, and... news articles. But if you think of an Ecosystem as a network graph, it makes more sense: assets are the nodes of the graph - they exist within the ecosystem and are connected to eachother through relationships, which form the edges.
The formal definition of Asset is a ""useful or valuable thing"", which accurately describes the different types of assets within any given ecosystem: ecosystems are inherently made up of a network of people, who form organizations, who offer resources, create opportunities, and generate activity.
Importantly, ""Assets"" refer to the real-world instances of these categories. For example, here are some examples of Assets in Baltimore's Tech Ecosystem:
Based on this example, you may have noticed three things:
""Assets"" are a sweeping description of many things - so how do we define them? Let's dive in.
If you have ever tried to do Ecosystem Mapping, you likely ran into the ""categorization problem"". You, know...
And on, and on, and on. One of the reasons that Ecosystem Mapping is so hard is because it is incredibly difficult to come up with a system of labels to describe everything within an ecosystem. We do this for a living, and it took nearly four years and hiring a linguist to create EcoMap's Data Paradigm, the classification system we use to tag all of the data we collect for our customers.
Even though a giant corporation and a news article are both assets, they are obviously very different. This difference is captured by the two main categories of Assets - Primary Assets and Secondary Assets
Primary Assets represent the core ""things"" in an ecosystem, namely People and Organizations:
Primary Assets tend to be persistent (they last a long time), categorizable (you can bucket them into known categories), and influential (their existence has a measurable impact on the composition of an ecosystem.
(And yes - Organizations are made up of People, but thanks to centuries of commerce, they exist and persist separately from the people that form them at any given time)
Secondary Assets only exist through the actions of, or interactions between, Primary Assets. Secondary Assets tend to be transient (their importance is time-bound), smaller, and generally less influential to the ecosystem.
Even if these categories seem unfamiliar, you are likely familiar with them. When you map your ecosystem, you first identify the ""Key Players"" in the ecosystem, or the People and Organizations. Then, you might gather more detailed information about what they do - the programs they offer, the jobs they have, what they are up to - AKA, the Resources, Opportunities, and Activity related to them.
If you are super interested in how Assets are categorized, read section 3. If not, skip to Section 4: Why Assets Matter.
When we started EcoMap, the first thing we did was define a set list of ""Keywords"" that we were going to use to tag all of the data about Baltimore's Business Ecosystem. This Keyword set was about 100 values long. As we have expanded across the world, this list of Keywords has become a full-blown data paradigm, with thousands of values.
This paradigm allows us to tag all data that EcoMap curates in a standardized way, which not only allows our customers to understand how their ecosystem breaks down, but also enables people to filter on our platforms - when you search for ""Funding"" for ""Growth Startups"" with ""Black Founders"", you are seeing this data paradigm in action.
The details of our Asset Typology are proprietary, but we'll share a broad overview of how it works. Our Asset Typology has ""layers"" of classification, each increasingly more specific:
Each layer leads to either a single or multiple values in the next layer - for example, Primary Assets include People and Organizations.The chart below shows our asset Categories and Types, but only includes some Subtypes for one Type of asset, and then even fewer Attributes. In reality, there are thousands of values at the Subtype and Attribute level. Plus. at the Attribute level, there are even more layers of classification - each group of Keywords has a type - including General Keywords (like Free or Virtual), Industries (Technology, or Artificial Intelligence), Audience, Location, and more.
Every single Asset can be defined by some combination of these different classifications. For example, EcoMap Technologies would be:
There are dozens more Keywords, but you get the idea. For something that took us four years, we tried to keep this section short, but if you want to learn more you can always setup a call us and we're happy to dive deeper
</nerd section>
Because ecosystems are all around us and they are made of assets, assets matter because you can't avoid them. Even you, dear reader, are a cherished asset within the ecosystems you exist in. In this way, most of us are already familiar with these assets and their categories, even if we don't use the same words - we know our coworkers are people, we work for organizations, our organizations may offer programs, and on and on.
Being honest, it's not important that you understand the theoretical underpinning of assets (that's our job) - what matters is that you understand the assets in your ecosystems. When you are trying to understand the complex networks that make up your tech hub, or small business community, or industry association, it helps to have language to describe what these ecosystems are made of: assets.
In short, Assets help us understand what exists, and who is doing what, within our ecosystems.
This is why Ecosystem Mapping is mostly about identifying the different assets and what they do. Once we have this information, we have an idea of the ""landscape"" that we are operating in. Understanding the assets in our ecosystem also allows us to identify overlaps and gaps, which is crucial for ecosystem building.
But to truly understand the ecosystem, we have to go one step further - we have to understand the relationships that connect these assets."

Is Ecosystem just a buzz word? Learn about the difference between ecosystems, networks, communities, and more
Think ""Ecosystem"" is simply jargon for a community or network? Think again.
There are few things we are more passionate about over here at EcoMap than the concept that Ecosystems are real. Few people argue with that, but here's where it get controversial: ecosystems are real, they are different than ""communities"" or ""networks"", and understanding these differences are fundamental to effective ecosystem building. Don't buy it? Read on.
A big misconception about ecosystems is that they are no different than communities, and you can approach building them the same way as you approach community building. This approach leads inevitably to frustration, because while ecosystems and communities often go together, they are not the same.
Let's start with the fundamental difference: ecosystems are networks of a variety of assets - including organizations, resources, opportunities, activities, and people - whereas communities are networks of people. The definition of a community is similar to the definition of an ecosystem in that the networked assets share a certain characteristic (per Webster: ""a Community is a group of people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common"") - but in communities, People are the only asset.
This makes sense - you don't hear people say ""a community of organizations"", or a ""community of events"" - we naturally know that communities exist between people. Ecosystems, on the other hand, come from the intersection of many types of assets, including - but not limited to - people. Why does this distinction matter?
The existence of an ecosystem does not guarantee the existence of a community
Ecosystems exist naturally, and communities do not. By definition, when there is a network of organizations, people, resources, and other assets that share some common characteristic (whether that is a geography, industry, or shared partner), an ecosystem exists. While the existence of an ecosystem says nothing about the health, robustness, or effectiveness of that ecosystem, it is indeed there whether anyone intentionally builds it or not.
Communities, on the other hand, do not exist naturally - they have to be formed through the interaction of people. There could theoretically be an ecosystem that has no community within it, although this would be a rare and likely a temporary state. The important result is that there could be a very large, robust ecosystem that has a very weak or small community.
Take an industry, for example. Industries are large ecosystems with many assets within them, namely the companies and other organizations that operate in that space. But despite having many organizations in an ecosystem, it is possible that people from those organizations are not connected - that there is no community within that industry. In this case, you have robust ecosystem, but a weak community.
This is the case in many entrepreneurial ecosystems - there is a relatively robust ecosystem with different founders, advisors, entrepreneur support organizations, programs for startups, etc, but the people in that ecosystem aren't well connected. You could continue to add new organizations, resources, or people to the ecosystem, but if the people within the ecosystem do not form a strong community, it will be really hard for that ecosystem to be effective. Why?
As discussed in the article on Relationships, the ""strongest"" ecosystems have high degrees of interconnectivity: there are many relationships between assets relative to the number of assets. The most influential relationships in ecosystems tend to be the informal relationships between people - not contracts between organizations or other formal relationships. Therefore, ecosystem builders need to intentionally build the community within the ecosystem, as well as building the ecosystem itself (more on this next week!)
Hopefully the difference between ecosystems and communities is clear - we'll dive into why this distinction matters so much in future topics. But what about networks?
Ecosystems and Communities are united by an important, shared characteristic: they are networks
Ecosystems are networks of organizations, people, resources, opportunities, activity, and other assets that share a common characteristic, and communities are networks of people. The definition of a network is simply, ""a group or system of interconnected people or things, which tracks with our definitions. Networks are made up nodes (assets, in ecosystem theory lingo) connected by edges (relationships). In Ecosystem Theory, a ""network"" describes the underlying structure of an ecosystem, whereas the ""ecosystem"" is the actual instance of the network in the real world. Baltimore's Tech Ecosystem has an underlying network structure, but the ecosystem refers to the real-world collection of organizations, resources, etc, and not the core, underlying network structure itself.
Unlike the difference between communities and ecosystems, the difference between ecosystems and networks is nuanced, up for debate, and honestly, not very important - at this point, you're talking mostly about linguistic preference, and not important differences between the two. In fact, many of the foundations of understanding ecosystems was done by Dr. Brint Milward in his study of networks; in his work, ""network"" could be swapped with ""ecosystem"" and the insights are preserved.
Many of the characteristics and challenges of ecosystems are caused by, or related to, their network structure, so understanding networks are fundamental to understanding ecosystems. Here are just a few characteristics of ecosystems that can be directly related to their networked structure:
We can - and will - go on and on about these topics in future articles.
A while ago, someone picked a fight on our Linkedin over our use of the word ""Ecosystem"", saying that the business world had commandeered the word from ecology. He is, of course, correct. The word ""Ecosystem"" was first introduced in 1935 by British ecologist Arthur Tansley. It's a combination of the Greek words ""oikos"" and ""systema"", or ""house"" and ""system"", used to describe the complex, interconnected system of living organisms in their shared physical environment. Tansley saw ecosystems both as self-regulating and self-sustaining systems, where each part played a critical role in maintaining the balance of the system.
Sound familiar? Our modern use of ecosystem is absolutely co-opted from the ecological use, but for good reason - the definitions and implications remain largely similar.
Just as green ecosystems are complex, interconnected, and interdependent systems of living organisms, modern ecosystems are complex, interconnected, and interdependent systems of assets
Both types of ecosystems change constantly, and changes in one part of the system influence other parts, even if they don't seem related. Just like green ecosystems, modern ecosystems can subsist with subpar resources for a long time, but they won't be able to thrive without the necessary inputs. Just like green ecosystem, healthy modern ecosystems can adapt when an asset is toxic, or if it dies out completely. And just like green ecosystems, modern ecosystems that are neglected, fragmented, and unhealthy won't bear abundant fruit. We could draw comparisons forever.
Before the phrase ""Ecosystem Building"" came into popular use, there was a concept called ""Economic Gardening"" introduced by Chris Gibbons in the 1980s. Gibbons was working as an economic development consultant in Littleton, Colorado, when he became frustrated with the traditional economic development approach of attracting large corporations. Instead, he thought it was important to focus on growing small and medium businesses within the community, using a process similar to gardening - that is, creating a strong environment that provide the resources and attention that these small businesses needed to grow.
For everyone who hates the jargon of ""ecosystems"", we hear you. The phrase has been overused in many ways, and many people misuse it as they refer to communities, networks, movements, organizations, and (the worst) - Web3 protocols. But despite this, the word ""Ecosystem"" is fundamental to our understanding of modern economic and community development, because it forces us to acknowledge that we can't build robust communities without taking into account the broader system, the whole environment.
If we want to build robust communities, we need robust ecosystems. To build robust ecosystems, we have to understand the interconnected nature of the systems that we live and work in. In the most honest way, we must learn how to be good gardeners.
Gibbons had the right idea."

Ecosystems are networks of assets tied together through different relationships. Learn about the bonds that unite them
Ecosystems are networks of assets tied together through different relationships. Learn about the bonds that unite them
In ecosystems, Relationships are the connections that tie Assets together, or the edges between the nodes that make up the final part of the underlying ecosystem network structure
As discussed in the last topic, ecosystems are full of Assets - the organizations, people, resources, opportunities, and activity that make up any community or industry. But in order for these assets to form an ecosystem, they must be connected in some way - that's where Relationships come in.
Relationships are, perhaps unsurprisingly, the different ways that assets are related to eachother within an ecosystem - for example, how an organization ""funds"" a resource, a person is ""employed by"" an organization, or a news article is ""about"" a specific initiative or opportunity. Relationships are arguably the most important part of any given ecosystem - if the assets were not related to eachother, it wouldn't be an ecosystem at all. Additionally, the relationships between assets are what determine the structure of an ecosystem, how it changes, and whether or not it is ""healthy"" or ""effective.
Before we dive into why relationships matter in ecosystems, it helps to understand them better. Just like Assets, Relationships have different characteristics that are used to understand them and their influence on both the assets they connect and the ecosystem as a whole.
The first layer of classifying Relationships is their category, of which there are two: Formal and Informal relationships:
There is, of course, some grey area between the two - if you have a handshake agreement of a partnership, is that a Formal or Informal relationship? The answer may very well depend on local laws, regulations, and norms. Typically, however, there is a functional difference between the two categories.
Formal relationships between assets outline specific ways in which each asset is expected to behave in the relationship - such as an organization agreeing to pay an employee in exchange for their labor. On the other hand, informal relationships tend to lack behavioral agreements or expectations.
While both formal and informal relationships can be broken, formal relationships tend to be formally broken (like an agreement being severed or a contract expiring), and both assets are aware that the relationship has dissolved. After this, the formal relationships tend to be replaced with informal ones (such as business partners to friends), or it is replaced with a different formal relationship (such as an employee signing a severance agreement after their employment ends).
Informal relationships change much more often, because there are no rules or regulations around the relationships - friends or partners can come and go, and no one needs to sign anything. However, it is faulty to think that informal relationships are less important than formal ones - in fact, informal relationships tend to have a much stronger influence on ecosystems than their formal counterparts, as we'll discuss in Part 4.
In addition to these categories of relationships, relationships are also bucketed into different Relationship Types, which describe ""how"" two things are related. Unlike the two categories, there are numerous types of relationships, and they vary based on the ecosystem under consideration. Some examples include:
There are some heuristics that help you understand the Category of a relationship based on its Type - for example, funding relationships tend to be formal, but there are no hard and fast rules. Now that we understand the basic ways we can classify Relationships, let's examine two additional attributes: a Relationship's Direction & Strength.
While Relationship Category & Type are the most important attributes to understand, there are other characteristics of relationships that describe how assets are related to eachother, such as the Relationship's Direction and Strength.
The Direction of a relationship indicates how each asset experiences the relationship - if both assets experience the relationship in the same way, then there is no direction to the relationship. However, if the experience of Asset A is different than that of Asset B, then there is a direction to the relationship.
Let's look at an example - a startup funded by a venture capital firm has a “funding relationship” with the firm, just as the firm has a “funding relationship” with the startup. However, the startup experiences this relationship differently - they receive funds (and oversight), whereas the firm provides funds, and hopefully gains a larger return in the long run. There is a clearly a direction to this relationship.
In other scenarios, both assets experience the relationship in largely the same way. For example, if EcoMap competes with EcoLack, and EcoLack competes with EcoMap, even if one company dislikes the other more, or if one is winning in the market, the relationship is more or less experienced the same between the two assets, and there is not much use to trying to specify a direction between it.
The Direction of a relationship thus describes one component of how each asset experiences the relationship. However, there is one other factor at play: the Strength of the Relationship.
The Strength of a relationship is a measure of how much influence each asset has on the other because of the existence of the relationship.
In weaker relationships, the actions of Asset A tend to have little influence on Asset B. In stronger relationships, the actions of Asset A can have a large influence on Asset B. For example - you have a strong relationship with your partner, and their decision to leave the country would have a noticeable impact on you. However, you have a weak relationship with acquaintances, so if a high school classmate suddenly moved, you likely wouldn't notice or care.
The Strength of relationships differs from the other three characteristics in that it is nearly impossible to measure generically (meaning that you can define and measure the strength of relationships on a per-asset or per-ecosystem basis, but it would be nearly impossible to define a universal measure of relationship strength. Additionally, the strength of relationships can change overtime without any modification to the structure of the relationship, whereas changes in the category, type, or direction of a relationship would inherently indicate a change in the relationship's structure.
Yet second to the existence of a relationship itself, the strength of a relationship is perhaps the most consequential characteristic in terms of how that relationship influences both the assets and the broader ecosystem. Let's dive in to how these relationships - and their characteristics influence the ecosystems we live and work in everyday.
Obviously, relationships matter within ecosystems because without the edges between the asset nodes, the ecosystem wouldn't exist at all.
However, there are four specific attributes of ecosystems that are controlled or heavily influenced by the nature of the relationships between the various assets: the interconnectedness of the ecosystem, how information flows within it, how resistant the ecosystem is to change, and how equitable & accessible the ecosystem is.
There you have it! More than you would ever want to know about the relationships within an ecosystem."

162,https://ecomap.tech/topics/what-are-ecosystems,"Part 1: What are Ecosystems?
Ecosystems are ever-changing networks of people, resources, organizations, and the relationships between them, united by a common characteristic, such as a shared geography, industry, demographic, or combination of those factors.
The definition of modern ecosystems doesn't roll off the tongue, we know. Even if you haven’t heard the definition, you’ve probably heard it used:
- Baltimore’s Tech Ecosystem refers to the tech and startup community within the city of Baltimore.
- The Web3 Ecosystem refers to the collection of people, businesses, and other organizations who are involved with or building in Web3.
- Dallas’ Arts Ecosystem, The CleanTech Ecosystem, and Cisco’s Partner Ecosystem all simply refer to the constellation of people, organizations, resources, and the activity & relationships involved in those communities.
Part 2: Where are Ecosystems?
Ecosystems are everywhere. Every community is an ecosystem, every city is home to dozens of ecosystems, and every industry, sector, and subsector is an ecosystem as well. Most of us live and work in numerous ecosystems, and their prevalence is one of the main reasons why ecosystems are so important to understand.
The ‘characteristics that unite’ an ecosystem include industries (the Bioscience ecosystem), business models (the high growth startup ecosystem), geographies (Baltimore’s ecosystem), demographic groups (the Women-Owned ecosystem), and combinations of these factors (the Baltimore Women-Owned high-growth bioscience ecosystem).
These Unifying Factors, one of four core attributes of ecosystems, are what create the boundaries of an ecosystem; because of this, ecosystems can be infinitely nested within eachother, and adjacent ecosystems often overlap, such as Maryland's Business Ecosystem and Baltimore's Tech Ecosystem.
Part 3: What are Ecosystems made of?
Ecosystems are networks of Assets and the Relationships between them. Primary Assets are the main “things” within an ecosystem, and they include People, Organizations, and Resources. Secondary Assets are typically smaller, transient (their importance is time-based), and they arise from actions and interactions between Primary Assets. These include Events, Jobs, and News.
The Relationships are simply how these assets relate to eachother - which Organization provides which Resource, what Person is employed by what Organization, which Organizations partner together, etc. Structurally, ecosystems are complex networks, meaning they are made of nodes and edges, representing the Assets (nodes) and the Relationships between them (edges).
Part 4: Why do Ecosystems matter?
There are three main reasons that ecosystems matter:
- Ecosystems are everywhere
Every town, city, state, industry, sector, professional network, economy, impact initiative, demographic group, and beyond all share the same ecosystem structure: they are complex, always-evolving networks of assets bound together by relationships. Whether we like it or not, we live and work in numerous ecosystems, and it helps to understand how and why they work.
- Ecosystems teach us about how the world works
Due to this shared structure, all ecosystems are remarkably similar in the way information flows through them, how they change and are changed, and the challenges they face.
""The ecosystem lens"" helps you understand both how a new industry is formed and how a main-street economy is transformed. You can learn a lot about how information flows through an industry by studying how information flows through a university. Lessons learned from entrepreneurial ecosystem building can be applied to partner-network development, and the challenges faced by innovation ecosystems shed light on how we can improve small business communities.
Studying ecosystems allows you to quickly distill insights that are applicable across pretty much any network or community you find yourself in. In that way, studying ecosystems is a shortcut to understanding the numerous networks that we live & work in everyday.
- Ecosystems are incredible tools for change
Let’s say you want to create a stronger entrepreneurial community at a university. You could start an organization that does everything: an entrepreneurship club, incubator, accelerator, angel funding, conferences, and a mentor network. While possible, setting up that organization & getting the funding to run it takes an incredible amount of time and effort, and then there’s the uphill battle of promoting the organization and getting people into its network.
Alternatively, you could use an Ecosystem-Led Development Approach - identify all the different clubs, people, and events that are interested in entrepreneurship, create or strengthen the bonds between them, and mobilize each individual asset to set up a key part of the ecosystem. This approach is drastically more effective - it not only distributes the work, but it has a greater reach since each asset engages it’s own network, and it encourages more equitable engagement and outcomes because more people becoming involved in the growth of the ecosystem
Ecosystems matter not only because they are everywhere, but because they provide a simple way for us to understand the vast, complicated networks that we operate in, and they provide a model for creating systems-level change that is dramatically more effective than the discrete-change tactics that we tend to use. In short, understanding ecosystems gives us the tools we need to tackle systems-level problems and make sense of the complicated communities around us."
