1,https://pspost.co/3-examples-of-what-to-write-in-a-graduation-card/,"With every spring comes warmer weather and new beginnings. For many, it’s a time when they will embark on a new stage of life–a new grade in school or starting their first job. Spring graduations can be the perfect time to stop and celebrate not only everything a person has accomplished so far but also all that is in store for them in the future. They call it a commencement because it’s the beginning of something, not the end.
If you are celebrating a 2022 graduate this spring and you’re wondering what to write in a card, take a look at the 3 examples of graduation card messages.
What to write in a card:
For the kiddo graduating from preschool, kindergarten, or elementary school:
Congratulations! I have loved watching you grow up to be such a creative, smart, and fun kid! I am so proud of you, and I can’t wait to see what you will become when you grow up. But don’t grow up too fast! Enjoy being a kid and enjoy today. I love you.
P.S. Let’s go get ice cream to celebrate!
For the Gen Z’er who is graduating High School:
You did it!! Wow, these last few years have been hard on this whole planet, but especially for your generation. With delayed or canceled classes, proms, and school trips, you really went through a lot in your high school career. Think of the stories you’ll be able to tell! I am so proud of you and how you handled the many (so many!) challenges of the last 2+ years, and I’m equally excited to see what you do from here on out. Congratulations!
P.S. I think you’re snatched! (Did I use that word right? I googled it)
For the college graduate:
A big CONGRATS to you!! It seems like just yesterday I was watching you graduate from preschool, and now you’re graduating from college! It has been a true privilege to watch you grow up and now celebrate this next big milestone in your life. I could not be any prouder. Cheers!
P.S. Sorry America still hasn’t done anything about student loan debt
Now wipe away your tears of nostalgia and pride, and get that card in the mail! And with PS Post – mailing greeting cards from your phone or computer is easier than ever!
PS Post is the easiest way to mail cards with gifts – from any device to any mailbox, any time. Simply choose a card, write your personal message, add an e-gift card (we print it as a QR code!), and tell us where to mail it. You’ll have brought so much joy to their day with just a few clicks.
Have the inspiration to write a note to some right now? Here are some of our favorite graduation card designs for the graduate in your life:"
2,https://pspost.co/3-ways-that-giving-a-gift-is-surprisingly-good-for-you/,"Who doesn’t love the experience of opening a gift from someone, especially when it’s a gift they picked out just for you?
Regardless of whether it’s a gift-giving season or a simply thoughtful occasion, you can’t help but appreciate the sentiment when you’re given a special gift or card.
Brain Booster
It’s been proven that one gift impact for the person giving the gift is an increase in a bunch of chemicals that actually make you happier. Endorphins, serotonin, and dopamine are just a few. You know what they say–If you’re happy and you know it, send a gift!
Heart Healthy
Gift-giving from the heart is actually *good* for your heart! It’s good for your whole body, in fact! Giving someone “gifts for keeps” (aka things that won’t collect dust in their closets) can help to lower blood pressure and even help reduce anxiety!
Good Vibes
True benevolent gift-giving means you don’t expect a gift back in return, but karma has a way of rewarding thoughtful gestures anyway. Who knows, maybe you’ll be on the receiving end of a gift sometime in the future.
P.S. At PS Post, we can confirm that it feels oh-so-good to give gifts and cards–we get to do it all day every day! Check out our card and gift card options at PSPost.co, and experience the joys of gift giving firsthand!
P.S.S. The bee seed packet in the featured photo comes from The Peoples Bees’ unique blend of native pollinator flower seeds.

Living in Colorado and enjoying the incredible beauty of this great world has given us a deep sense of commitment to sustainability and responsible consumption. We care about our planet and we know you do too; so we are always working to make our products and process as sustainable as possible.
Reducing Plastic
Traditional gift cards often aren’t recyclable because they’re usually made of plastic that can’t be broken down; we’re here to change that. The printed QR code in our cards, your gift, keep those plastic gift cards from even having to be made.
Using Recycled Papers
The physical cards that you’ll send (and hopefully receive) are made using 100% recycled paper to help reduce waste and greenhouse emissions."

Celebrate them the way they want to be celebrated of course!
The way you want your birthday celebrated is so important.
When we were growing up, my brother and I had completely opposite approaches to celebrating our birthdays.
I love my birthday. My best friend & I have celebrated half birthdays every year since we were 6 years old. I wanted a birthday week —better yet— a whole month.
My brother is like the character Ron Swanson (from the show Parks & Rec) when it comes to his birthday. It’s a sacred day — to not receive any attention whatsoever. The only time he wants the spotlight is when he is performing his music solo or with a band. I’ll probably get a call from him for even mentioning his birthday in a public blog (sorry bro!!! ily!).

11,https://pspost.co/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-qr-codes/,"So much has changed in our day-to-day lives since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic; among those changes is a new focus on a contactless economy. Thanks to innovations in technology and a resurgence of the QR code, it’s hard to even remember a time when we exchanged paper tickets for events, handed paper menus back to our servers, and used cash for most of our purchases. Before the start of the pandemic, the question was “does anyone still use QR codes?” and now we are looking at a QR code future. Read below for answers for some of the most common questions including details about QR code products and QR code shopping.
What does QR Code mean?
– A QR (short for Quick Response) code stores its information in the distance between the squares within the code. Once a machine scans the assortment of elements, it is translated into data. Most QR codes expire, but some can be modified to remain permanent.
How to use QR Codes?
– It’s easy! Open the “camera” app on your smartphone
– Point the camera at a QR code
– Tap on the “scan QR code” icon or link notification that appears
What are the advantages of QR Codes?
– QR code benefits span far and wide, from saving paper waste to preventing the spread of germs and viruses. QR code adoption can mean important information is one click away from being displayed on someone’s personal cellular device.
How do I use a QR code for business?
– There are countless ways for businesses to interact with customers, receive feedback, and increase brand engagement by using QR code technology. A QR code can link to an advertisement, discount code, or website, thereby driving customers and clients directly to the business.
What are some products with QR codes?
– It is so easy to add a QR code to a flyer, sign, or mailer. If you’re creating a menu, you can even use a free QR code generator for restaurant menus to help you out.
Now that you know the FAQs for QR codes, give it a try! Do a quick search for a “free QR code generator” and try your hand at some creative uses for the codes.
P.S. At PS Post, we *love* QR codes! You could say we are QR greeting cards! It’s how we attach gift cards to the cards we send out without using single-use plastic gift card material (which can’t be recycled, by the way). Take a look at some of the cards and gift card options we have available at PSPost.co!"
12,https://pspost.co/faq/,"Frequently Asked Questions

Q: How long will it take for my card to arrive?

Q: How do I cancel an order?
A: We are happy to cancel and refund your order before we begin processing the order. Unfortunately, once the order has been processed, we cannot cancel it.
Q: Can I send a card internationally?
A: Unfortunately, not at this time. While we could easily send the card with an international stamp, many companies have different international sales systems, so spending the gift cards gets a little tricky. But we’re working on this so that you soon can!
Q: I don’t live in the United States but I want to mail a card to someone in the US. Can I do that?
A: Yes! PS Post is perfect for expats & anyone outside the States with friends or family here. Write your card, add a gift card if you’d like, and we will mail it to them!

Q: What happens if my card is returned to my return address?
A: Oops! Then there’s likely an address issue. Send us an email at info@pspost.co and we’ll send a new card to the updated address right away at no cost to you. We’ll also send you a code to send your next card on us!
QR Codes
Q: What is a QR code?
A: A QR code is a two-dimensional, multifunctional version of a barcode. Unlike a bar code, which requires a fancy scanner found in stores, you can use your mobile device to take a picture of the code.
Q: How do I use a QR code?
A: Open the camera on your mobile device, position your phone like you’re about to take a picture, and voila! A banner will appear at the top of your screen to direct you to the custom web address. Scanning a QR code from a PS Post card will reveal a specially selected electronic gift card.
Q: Will the QR code work on all devices?
A: Most devices have an integrated QR Code reader built in so you can access through the camera. All iPhones updated to iOS 11 can point their camera and scan away. Android 9 and Android 10 have a built-in QR code scanner courtesy of Google Lens. Open your camera app and point it at the QR code to see a URL pop-up. Android 7.0 and below require an app to scan QR codes.
If the lucky gift-getter does not have a QR code-read-phone, no worries! There are a plethora of apps that are easy to download and use with a touch of a button. Here’s a list of some of the best QR reader apps.

13,https://pspost.co/forgot-a-birthday/,"Sorry I Missed Your Birthday…
What to do when you forget someone’s big day
We’ve all done it. The heart-sinking realization when it clicks: “I forgot my best friend’s birthday” or “oh my god, I forgot my girlfriend’s birthday what do I do?”
It is the WORST feeling.
Seeing birthdays on Facebook is great, unless you’re one of the many people who have essentially stopped using Facebook.
And between new phones, email calendars, lost backups, or just – *gestures everywhere* – life itself, it’s easy to let something get in between you and the special day for someone you care about.
How to make it up to someone for a missed birthday
Let’s talk about late birthday wishes.
There are several different kinds of “not wishing someone happy birthday” . There are the people that you’d probably text after writing on their Facebook wall or posting a comment on their celebratory Instagram. Next, there are the people you would call or send a happy birthday card to. Finally the “oh sh*t” people that you can absolutely, positively NOT forget their birthdays.
Please see the very informative chart below.
Facebook DM or Text: The “happy day after your birthday” message
For the first circle, your journey is going to be a little bit easier. “Sorry we missed your birthday” is a lot easier to say to a friend you see occasionally than it is to say when you forgot your girlfriends birthday.
These are the kind of people that you can send a text or dm saying “happy day after your birthday” or “I hope you had a great birthday” because you are still taking the time to recognize their birthday and let them know that you are thinking of them, even if you didn’t happen to think of them on their actual birthday.
They’ll appreciate the thought and likely will be able to spend more time replying than they would on their actual birthday because they aren’t inundated with so many messages.
Sending a card or giving them a call
The second circle is where things get a little more complicated.
You can send a belated birthday card, or a late birthday card. Though you may find yourself asking “what does Happy Belated Birthday mean?”
To put it simply, belated means something is late or delayed, like your amazon order or your one friend with ADHD who can never show up on time, and is the Emily Post approved way of saying “sorry for the late birthday wishes”.
So now you’ve got your belated birthday card (or you can send just a regular birthday card and let them know in your message that yes, this is a better late than never happy birthday, we’ll link our favorites below) and you’re wondering what to write in a belated birthday card.
What to Write in a Belated Birthday Card
Keep it simple. Forgetting a birthday is not a crime – it happens – and this circle of friends or family will be more understanding and won’t need elaborate excuses. Something as simple as sorry I missed your birthday will do.
The key here is that this is still a card for them and to them.
Don’t waste precious space drawing attention to your forgetfulness, now is the time to appreciate them!
We love to write about a favorite memory, story, or even just tell them what you like about them.
You can still make someone feel special (and you WILL) just by sending a card at all.
Now that we know what to say in a belated birthday card, let’s move on to the next circle where we’ll discuss how to make up for forgetting a birthday.
How to Make Up for Forgetting a Birthday – Thoughtful Options for Your Inner Circle aka the “Oh Sh*t” tier
We’ve reached the “oh sh*t” circle of birthday forgetting. Like, “I forgot my wifes birthday” bad.
This is the kind of forgetting that is going to take some explaining.
Luckily, for this instance only, we are living in an EXTREMELY long unprecedented time and historical event. Things are tough right now, for everyone. We are all having to save space for the people we love who are also struggling with the pandemic and everything else. This is the time when you’ll be asking for that space and that forgiveness.
Again, be honest. Let them know that you screwed up and you are sorry. We’d advise against long, drawn-out excuses. They don’t want to hear about the long conference at work, the traffic, or the dissociative state you’ve been in. They probably already know and hopefully will consider that!
thoughtful gifts for your closest people
You should try to do or find something that is completely them. This is where thoughtful gifts or hangouts really shine.
Does this person love books and coffee? Take them to a bookstore and let them wander and pick some of the books they’ve been eyeing – your treat. Then go to their favorite coffee spot or the one they’ve been wanting to try and let them tear into that new book with you by their side.
Does this person have a drink or snack that they can never be without? Buy them that drink or snack IN BULK and give it to them.
The point is to let them know that you see them and that you know them, and you like them even more for it. This is not the time for a sorry I missed your birthday card, it’s time to pull out all of the stops.
P.S. You Got This!
Whether you missed it by a few hours or a few weeks, we believe in you. Know you’ve got this (and that you’ve added their birthday to your calendar – with a reminder!).
At PS Post, birthday cards are kind of our thing–whether they are sent in advance or after that “oh sh*t” moment. Take a look at some of our favorite cards for belated birthdays below!

20,https://pspost.co/how-to-thank-your-boss-without-looking-like-a-suck-up/,"Expressing gratitude at work, especially to coworkers and employees, is always a good idea. A simple “I admire your work ethic” can go a long way. But what if you respect your boss, and you want to let them know without it coming across like you are only being complimentary for your own benefit?
How do you demonstrate gratitude at work toward your boss without looking like a suck up or making your coworkers roll their eyes? Here are some ways to show gratitude at work that will make your boss feel recognized and appreciated:
Be Specific
Write an email or card that details what you are thankful for. Start out with “I admire your work” or “I feel grateful to work with you” and add details about instances when you felt supported. Maybe your boss is an expert at dealing with difficult coworkers or they coordinate going away gifts for coworkers–whatever it is you admire or appreciate at your boss, let them know it! The more specific the better!
Don’t go overboard
If you are giving your boss or manager a gift, make sure it’s not too extravagant, or you might run the risk of making them uncomfortable with how much you spent. Chances are that they know how much money you make and giving them an expensive gift might send the wrong message. A gift card to their favorite local coffee shop or a small plant for their desk is an appropriately sized gift for a boss.
Make it personal
If you have seen signs your coworkers are intimidated by you, you might not want to make it worse by showering your boss with praise in front of them. There are many types of coworkers, and if you have jealous or bossy coworkers, it might be best to thank your boss privately.
If you are wondering if you should acknowledge your boss and the help and support they offer you, we say go for it!

P.S. You Got this!

21,https://pspost.co/how-to-write-love-letters/,"Who doesn’t love receiving a love letter from someone they care about? Whether it’s a note of gratitude for a small favor or a good morning love letter that kicks off a feel-good day, it’s easy to read a love note and feel cherished and appreciated. What’s not so easy is coming up with love letter ideas and actually putting pen to paper.
If you’re reading this and thinking, “What do I write in a romantic love letter to my wife or partner?,” “What’s the secret sauce in the love letters of great men?,” or “What should I write in a letter to my boyfriend on his birthday?” Try some of the tips and tricks below.
1. Don’t Stress
If you are wondering how to make love letters by hand or how to write love letters, remember that it truly is the thought that counts (really!). It doesn’t matter if your message is reminiscent of famous letters written by poets or if you prefer to write and send your love letters online; what matters is that you have taken time out of your day to tell someone they are special to you.
2. Find a Balance
The best love letters are both a little sweet and a little salty. Don’t be afraid to be vulnerable by writing something heartfelt, and don’t shy away from a silly inside joke. This simple combination will help you write a love letter that will prompt a smile, laugh, or happy tear.
3. Sign it with love
Once you have finished writing your message and it’s time to sign it, don’t forget to sign it with love. If you are sending love letters long distance, a simple “I can’t wait to see you soon” reminds your special someone that you miss them. When in doubt, “I love you so much” never seems to go out of style.
The most important part of a love letter is the part when you actually send it. So send it! Life is short and taking the time to communicate your love for someone is always the right move.
P.S. At PS Post, our goal is to foster greater connectivity through messages of encouragement, celebration, and love. Card writing and sending is our love language, and we would love to help you spread your message! Some of our favorite “I love you cards” include “I love you more than winning an argument” and “You’re the hottest person I know.” Check out these cards and more at PSPost.co!"

Friendship love is valid and real and now we have an excuse to celebrate! It is a Valentine’s Day for friends on the day before Valentine’s Day.

Galentine’s Day Party Ideas
Some of the best Galentine’s Day activities would, of course, include a Galentine’s Day brunch, in honor of our patron saint Leslie Knope. Luckily, the day before Valentine’s Day in 2022 falls on a Sunday. Sunday, as we all know, is the best day for a girls brunch party. Hopefully, someone in your group of gals loves to play hostess, however, now that restaurants are a bit safer, that’s always a good option too. You can have each guest bring their favorite breakfast or brunch food to share. If breakfast isn’t your thing feel free to make a baked brie or a cheese plate filled with berries and a good cabernet soaked asiago.
If brunch feels a bit passé, here are a few other Galentine’s Day ideas. While these ideas may not be exactly what Leslie had in mind, we were not invited to the Parks and Rec Galentine’s Day episode writers room, so feel free to make your Galentine’s Day your own! There is no wrong answer to “what is a Galentine’s party.” All of your Galentine’s are different so all of your Galentine’s Day party activities can be as unique as them!"

The Best Galentine’s Gifts
If your Galentine’s are separated by time and space, send them a Galentine’s gift that will be better than any Valentine they’ve ever gotten (some men could never). Here are some of the best Galentine’s gifts (according to us):
A cozy robe: it’s indulgent, something they wouldn’t buy themselves, and they’ll think of you every time they put it on. We love this one from Quince, an affordable and sustainable brand, and at $49.90 you’re bank account will love it too.
A book that you’ve read and loved. You can choose something from your own library or we recommend “Big Friendship” by Aminatou Sow and Ann Friedman, Buying from Bookshop.org supports local bookstores which makes it even better.
The cult favorite: Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask. If they have lips then they need this, and it’s just pricey enough that they might not buy it for themselves (but totally in your budget, phew). We’d recommend berry or vanilla.
The best mug on the planet (we will not be taking questions). Made by hand from that GOOD North Carolina clay, owned and operated by Alex Matisse (yes the great-grandson of *that* Matisse, they give back to their community and pay living wages. Offered in stunning glazes and sure to make their mornings a little brighter. Every shade is perfect but we love the Rococo for your Galentine.
A moment of body appreciation, relaxation, and care with Kate McLeod’s body stones. These are made with natural ingredients, certified cruelty free, and vegan! This solid moisturizer is more than just another nice smelling lotion, it’s a ritual of self-care that gives you permission to thank your body for all that it does. This will make your Galentine feel loved and help them battle these cold months. We love the Grounding Stone.
More than mail. We’d be remiss if we didn’t mention sending a P.S. Post card with a gift card to your Galentine’s favorite store (we’ve got something for everyone from your hiker friend’s REI obsession to your friend who copes with life by running to Target). We print our cards on 100% recycled paper and our cards feature a QR code that links to the gift card so there’s no plastic involved (and no way to lose it). Here’s our favorite Galentine’s card but there are so many good cards to choose from.

What to write in your Galentine’s card
Finding the right words can be tough, especially when you are looking for the best way to tell someone how much they mean to you. Happy Galentine’s Day messages can be anything you want but don’t worry, we’re here to guide you.
First, you’re going to want to think about what you are trying to convey. Do you want to encourage them, thank them for always answering your phone calls or picking you up from the airport, or are you going to remind them of an inside joke from 8th grade? Once you have an idea of what sentiment you want to send you can really get started.
Sometimes when finding the right words is hard, steal someone else’s! (No, not like that, you don’t want a cease and desist letter because that is the kind of mail that is super NOT fun) We’re talking quotes. A good place to find quotes is GoodReads because users are able to add quotes from any book so there is a LOT to choose from. In case you are now having decision paralysis and need some guidance, one of our favorite quotes is from the French novelist Marcel Proust:
“Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy;
they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom.”
Consider what not to say
Something we try to NOT do when writing messages in our cards is to make it about us. For example: you’re the best thing that ever happened to ME, thank you for always being MY support, Me Me Me. Now, we aren’t saying that talking about yourself or framing your appreciation with how they have affected your life but instead we’d urge you to write about them.
We love to write messages that single out qualities that we love in our people. Your Galentine may be the type of person who brings people together and makes people feel seen. Maybe they are the type of person who always shows up or the type that never gives up. Maybe you’re inspired by their kindness or ability to see hope in even the darkest times. Let them know that you see this special, wonderful thing that they do and that it’s important.
We also love reminiscing on the good old days or even the yesterdays that weren’t so great. Write about a time that was special to you or a time that was terrible and thankfully now you can both look back and kind of laugh? We’ve learned the hard way that the not so great times that have since turned funny are for cards and NOT wedding toasts. (Learn from our mistakes. Also, Emily, we apologize). They may not have mentally flagged an experience so you reminding them means they get to live it again and makes them feel special and cared for because you both remember and care enough to write about that time you ran into the ocean singing Jason Derulo at midnight, or like whatever your memories are, we don’t judge.
Writing messages in cards– especially in cards meant for our big friendships, our galentines, our people who keep us mostly sane – can feel like a big, overwhelming task. When you break it down and realize that this is simply an extension of a text thread or phone call and not a wedding toast (again, we are SORRY Emily), you’ll feel comfortable just talking to them because that’s exactly what you’re doing. Above all else, be you and be authentic. They’ll see you in your writing and feel close to you, which is what it’s all about.
We hope this helped and that you credit us for the absolutely amazing and thoughtful Galentine’s card messages. May we suggest you write those messages on one of our carefully curated Galentine’s day cards?
Happy Galentine’s day to you and yours and to our dear Leslie Knope."

133,https://pspost.co/shop/cards/friendship/just-beecause-card-seed-packet-national-pollinator-week-special/,"Just Beecause Card & Seed Packet
Let someone know you’re thinking of them and help to spread some bee-friendly blooms! PS Post has teamed up with The Peoples Bees to bring to you a card that spreads love *and* bee-friendly blooms.
In honor of the important role pollinators play in our ecosystem, this “Just Beecause” card comes with a 2oz packet of The Peoples Bees unique blend of native pollinator flower seeds.
Outside: Just Beecause
Inside: blank
About Bee Feed: The seeds are sourced from a small, independent, Colorado-based seed producer, and the flowers and grasses in the mixture are all native to North America (specifically the Rocky Mountain region). Planting native plants supports native pollinators—like solitary bees, bumblebees, moths, butterflies, and birds—who are the most in need of saving. And these seeds are easy-beesy (not sorry) to plant! Sow in late fall for spring blooms.

My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. – Maya Angelou
Dear Friend,
Thank you for supporting PS Post in the time since we first launched in December 2020. You didn’t just purchase a card from a women-owned startup, you made someone’s day with one of the best gifts of all — words from the heart.
We built PS Post to make sending notes and gifts to friends easier and bring more joy to the everyday through something as simple as a greeting card.
A lot has happened since we opened! You’ve sent thousands of cards, bringing smiles to just as many faces. We’ve onboarded incredible new retailers like PlantGem, DoneGood, and Bookshop.org and refined our purchasing experience from your feedback. PS Post was accepted to and completed a rigorous 4-month accelerator to support our growth; then received an investment from the Conscious Venture Fund! And most recently, we won a huge prize to build out our business & bulk card-sending capabilities with a skilled team of user-experience experts.
It’s all because of you – your early support, and continued trust in us to send your congratulations, condolences, encouragement, and your gifts. Your suggestions, issues to troubleshoot, and ideas show us you care. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you.
We’re on a mission to make PS Post the most accessible, intuitive, and joyful way to send one or hundreds of personalized cards with e-gift experiences. What’s next? Late summer, expect a brand new card personalization & purchasing experience (it looks so cool). We will soon be adding new features like bulk card sending for individuals and businesses, the ability to schedule your card delivery date, and new e-gift features like video messages, nonprofit donations, and new retailers!
We’re big fans of beautiful, quality greeting cards as a means of intimate connection. For your support of the same vision, we thank you.
With a big hug or friendly smile (your choice),
Keller Anne, Cait, and the PS Post Team"
282,https://pspost.co/the-ultimate-gift-giving-guide-for-expats/,"Sitting down to send a gift, card, or letter to someone can be hard to do, but it’s especially hard if you’re living in a different country. If you’re someone who is living abroad and you need to send a baby gift or graduation card to someone in the U.S., it can be challenging to plan far enough in advance so the gift arrives on time, not to mention expensive. Check out or list of easy gifts to mail (or email) and other signature gifts that are easy to send from outside the U.S.
1. Send a homemade video
The beauty of an electronic gift is that it’s free to send, but it also doesn’t always come across as personal as other gifts. That’s where creating a video collage of photos or a personalized video message comes in. It’s both easy to send and it still has a very personal touch. Finally, the perfect gift.
2. Create a playlist
Sometimes you have to think outside the box, or in this case, outside the envelope. Maybe you haven’t created a mixed tape or playlist for someone since you were a teen, but that’s all the more reason to make one now. If you’re looking for the perfect gift, what is better than a compilation of special songs to send to someone back home?
3. Send a PS Post card
If you want to send a physical card to someone but don’t have time for it to travel across the ocean… well, we have been there. Try out our card-sending service at PSPost.co and let us be your personal gift buying service! Just go to our website and pick out a card. Then type a message, add a gift card (if you want), and click send. We’ll handle the rest!
Whether you are an expat, a study abroad student, or you’re just traveling overseas and realized you’re about to miss someone’s birthday, now you have some ideas for ways to gift from afar.
P.S. Did you know that at PS Post, we are constantly adding card designs, gift card retailer options, and other fun add-ons to make your card-sending experience the best that it can be. Check us out at PSpost.co!"

284,https://pspost.co/why-i-started-ps-post/,"Why I started PS Post
Keller Anne Ruble, Founder & CEO[7 min read]
Hi, I’m Keller Anne!
I started PS Post in 2020 with my co-founder, Caitlin, to make an easier way to send cards and gifts.
Why did we take a leap of faith and launch a startup… at the start of a pandemic? Life threw me a curve ball, and I decided to step up to the plate.
A small but mighty team had been building PS Post on nights and weekends just before the pandemic hit. Then, like most of us experienced in some way, shape, or form — 2020 threw me a huge curveball. My company was restructured, and I was let go.
Though it felt devastating at first, I started to see it as an exciting and rare opportunity to make PS Post a reality.
Instead of staying in the field where I had more than a decade of career experience, I decided to take to a leap of faith and work on PS Post full-time. If not now, when?
People loved the idea of PS Post, and I had to see what it could become!
So… a website to make sending cards easy, with an added bonus of sending gifts inside on QR codes. How did this come about?
1. Mail is Awesome!
I love getting mail. To me, taking the time to write a card— no matter how simple or well thought out— is an act of love.
When was the last time you got a personal letter? How did it make you feel?
Back in college, my grandma knew how much I loved checking my mailbox. Even though we talked regularly on the phone, she wrote me so many cards and letters – mostly just because. Of all the cards I’ve saved, I cherish those just-thinking-about-yous the most.
Mail kept a long-distance romance alive! I met my now-spouse just one month before he entered the Peace Corps. Despite a 10-hour time difference and thousands of miles between us, we wrote emails and letters, sent care packages, and hoarded precious Skype credits.
Starting a relationship only to immediately date long-distance was hard but all the little ways of staying in touch were deeply romantic. Our patience paid off – we’ve been married now for 7 years! It’s so special revisiting our letters now.
I know how special it can be to receive personal letters and cards in the mail. And I wanted to make it easier for everyone to send mail using their phone or computer.
2. Good cards are hard to find and harder to send
As much as I love cards, sometimes the process of getting a card in the mail felt more frustrating than it was worth. Greeting card aisles can feel a little overwhelming, picking up card after card after card.
What about thank you notes? It seems like no matter how recently I bought a pack of thank you notes, I never can find a matching card & envelope. Good luck locating an extra in case you don’t get it
write right the first time!
Once you’ve finally written your heart’s desire, what if you don’t find a stamp?
Life can get in the way of our best intentions sometimes.
With PS Post, we wanted to make it easy to follow through when inspiration strikes, with envelopes that stand out and cards that feel luxurious.
3. Sentimental? Very Much So
I have probably kept almost every card, ticket stub, or small ephemera from throughout my life. I have affectionately dubbed this, “emotional hoarding.”
They all live in an overflowing box, some organized in bags or photo albums by life chapters, some haphazardly stuffed (a sash from my senior sorority formal) or deliberately wedged (a gavel from a high school mock trial award).
my 5th birthday card
I’m not alone! 85% of Americans say they have special keepsakes. Four of the top five most popular keepsakes are a type of greeting card. The most popular by far? Birthday cards!
I love revisiting my box of memories from time to time – especially the notes. A Post-it left on my dorm room mirror from my best friend. A playbill decorated with pre-show tic-tac-toe. My grandma’s small, neatly slanted cursive. Something about holding on to a piece of paper whooshes you right back the where you were and who you were in that moment.
In an increasingly digital world, it’s nice to have something to hold onto.
4. I love giving gifts, but I am sometimes terrible at gift giving
I try my best to celebrate friends and family but sometimes I struggle with actually sending a gift. Sometimes I lost track of birthdays by not being on Facebook.
Part of the idea for PS Post came from going to weddings.
Once, we didn’t plan to take the gift to the wedding. The drive was a few hours from where we both lived, and I didn’t want to pack their gift only for them to drive it right back home. I brought the card but was too embarrassed to put it with the others. What if they read, “your gift is at our house!” and thought we didn’t actually get them a gift??
Sometimes I had gifts shipped to me so I could add my own card. The “this is a gift!” messages included in packages from online orders feel often like an afterthought to me, and I’ve always wanted a better option.
What about the times when you need a quick gift on the fly? It’s clear – people like gift cards!
They can treat themselves in whatever way they see fit. What people most often don’t like about gift cards is that they can feel impersonal.
Ultimately, I wanted a way to send a gift card inside a greeting card that still felt really special.
5. Yes, I am thoroughly obsessed with paper
I have journaled, sketched, drawn, and painted regularly my whole life. Since I was young, I have never met an office-supply aisle or paper store I didn’t love. Back-to-school shopping was a veritable pilgrimage. I love creating art of different mediums, but I’ve always been drawn to paper-craft – papier-mâché, scrapbooking, stamping, collage, and more.
In high school, I directed a play called One Thousand Paper Cranes (based on this children’s book). We folded dozens of 3 ft tall origami cranes to hang from the rafters and folded thousands more small cranes to spread throughout the auditorium. It was a pretty spectacular sight.
Now, I go into any stationery store I pass, just to feel different paper weights and grains. It’s almost too easy to lose track of time in art stores looking for the perfect sketchbook or paper medium for a new creation.
This obsession with paper guided us when sourcing paper for our cards and envelopes. We have high standards of what feels special to open, read, and keep!
6. Connection sparks joy
Writing a card to someone is an act of love. It says, “you’re important to me.” It’s time, energy, and feeling dedicated to another person.
Reading words from a friend or a loved one makes you feel closer to one another.
So many of us love a good card or letter. A 2020 survey found that 80% of people feel that social media can’t replace the same feeling of greeting cards, and the majority surveyed preferred receiving a card more than the same message via text.
In college, I tried to check my mail only once a week. My heart sped up turning the key to my small, metal box. Seeing an envelope tucked in there waiting to be read made my heart soar!
TL;DR: I started PS Post because I love the feeling of sending and receiving mail. I wanted to help people feel special, seen, surprised, and delighted during a simple, everyday moment like checking the mail.
Helping you bring joy to people you love through the mail? This is the best job in the world.
Thanks for being here, and for loving mail alongside us.
SWAK,
Keller Anne"
285,https://pspost.co/why-letter-writing-is-an-art-thats-not-even-close-to-dead/,"Sometimes all it takes to win someone over, resolve an argument, or express deep appreciation is to sit down and write a personal letter from the heart. Though traditional letter-writing has taken a back seat to sending texts and tiktoks, there is still something so special about writing and receiving handwritten letters or physical cards in your mailbox. You might think it takes practice writing letters, but the more important thing to do is to just start writing.
Read some reasons for why you should write and how to write a letter to someone special.
How to start a personal letter:
A personal letter should be just that, personal. Start off by addressing the recipient in a way that is appropriate, whether that be a casual nickname or other friendly salutation.
How to write a personal business letter:
Business letters should follow the formal business-letter format, even if they are personal. Formal business-letter format includes being left-justified, single-spaced, with New Times Roman size 12 font. The tone of the letter should be polite and clear.
How to write a personal thank you letter:
The best written thank you letters are specific about why you are grateful—how you needed the help, how you used the gift, or how you appreciated the favor. Start off your letter with a “Thank you for… “ and then detail why you are appreciative.
How to write a personal letter to a friend:
There are many things to say to your best friend that might bring a smile to their face. If you haven’t communicated with that friend in a while, write about what is new in your life—a funny family anecdote, your garden plans, job updates, or even the latest neighborhood gossip. If it’s a birthday letter to your best friend, remind them of memories together from previous years or any hopes you have for their next trip around the sun.
Keep an eye out for best friend appreciation day coming up on June 8, 2022, an anniversary, or a particular holiday to seize the opportunity and write a special letter to someone to let them know you’re thinking about them.
P.S. The art of letter writing is celebrated at PS Post, where we help to make mailing a card with a sweet message to someone a little bit easier. Visit PSPost.co, pick out a card, type your personal message, and let us take it from there!"
