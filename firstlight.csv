attacks and strokes in the United State by 2017. They will achieve this goal by increasing awareness of your blood pressure. They want you to get it in control and to do so, you need to make it your goal.
Currently 67 million Americans have high blood pressure. People with high blood pressure are 4 times more likely to die from a stroke and 3 times more likely to die from heart disease, compared to those with normal blood pressure*.
What can you do to avoid being one of these scary statistics? Our Nurse Gina says:
- Visit your doctor: Set up a doctor’s appointment and find out what your blood pressure is and what it should be. If it’s high, you shouldwork with your doctor to set a goal and a plan on how you can correct your blood pressure over time.
- Take your blood pressure medicine as directed. Be diligent on taking your mediation. Set daily reminders on your phone so that you take your medication at the same time each day. If you are having trouble taking your medicines on time or paying for your medicines, or if you are having side effects, ask your doctor for help.
- Quit smoking. Smoking causes many health issues so it is important that if you do smoke, you need to stop. If you don’t smoke, don’t start.
- Reduce sodium intake. Americans consume too much sodium. Check out our Facebook page during the month of February – we’re going to be sharing heart-healthy, lower-sodium recipes, meal plans, and helpful articles on heart health.

5,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/10-early-signs-of-alzheimers/,"Early diagnosis is extremely crucial with Alzheimer’s. The sooner you know you mayhave Alzheimer’s the more time you have to take advantage of all the treatment opportunities
available. It also gives you and your family time to know and understand the disease and enables you to plan for the future. With that said, the Alzheimer’s Association is a wonderful resource to use when researching information about Alzheimer’s, including the brain science behind it, doctors visits, as well as early signs and symptoms of Alzheimer’s. Below is the list of signs and symptoms to look for when addressing the
possibility of Alzheimer’s.
- Memory loss is one of the most common and early signs of Alzheimer’s. As we age, we all feel the wrath of memory loss, so do not feel as if this is always related to Alzheimer’s. The difference of Alzheimer’s type memory loss is you will notice it disrupting your daily life in many ways. For example, you may start to forget common information, requiring you to ask for this over and over again. You may start to rely more on memory aides such as notes and those around you.
- Planning and solving problems may become difficult for a person who potentially has Alzheimer’s. Tasks such as balancing a checkbook, following a recipe, or developing a plan may become more difficult.
- Difficulty with familiar tasks becomes apparent. For example, needing assistance using the oven or driving to a familiar place are crucial signs of early memory loss.
- Confusion with dates, times, and places becomes a problem. Knowing simple information like time of day and date is a very common Alzheimer’s symptom.
- You may begin to have trouble with visual images and spatial relationships. Color contrasts, judging distances, as well as simply reading may become difficult.
- You may notice yourself stopping in the middle of conversation to find the right word to use or to gather your thoughts. If this seems to become a habit and more disruptive than usual, it may be a sign of early Alzheimer’s.
- Misplacing things and not being able to retrace your steps is another sign of early Alzheimer’s.
- Your judgement when making a decision may become altered. For example, when dealing with money or addressing someone that needs information from you, such as when purchasing something.
- Many times, all the symptoms above will cause those at risk of Alzheimer’s to withdrawal from social situations. In itself, this can be an early sign.
- In addition, mood changes will become apparent.
As a disclaimer, all the symptoms above can be signs of something else other than Alzheimer’s or possibly simple brain inactivity that some experience without an underlying cause.
However, if you start to feel that any of these signs disrupt your daily life, it is imperative that you see a doctor to find out if the prognosis may possibly be Alzheimer’s. Also, educate yourself. The more you know about Alzheimer’s , the better you will be able to understand your treatment options."

7,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/10-things-seniors-can-do-to-keep-up-with-their-grandchildren/,"For older adults, relating to young people can be a challenge. It may take time, observation and investigation to fully understand what your grandchildren are interested in. But, after investing the time to learn about them and their interests, grandparents are able to relate to their grandchildren.
1. Play video games.
Video games, especially games on the Wii system, are a great way to have fun with grandchildren. Playing video games allow grandchildren to do something that they enjoy and also helps seniors to exercise their hand-eye coordination.
2. Teach your grandchildren how to do something you enjoy.
This can be especially fun for seniors—being able to pass down a hobby to their grandchildren can be exciting. These activities can include teaching them to play a card game or dominoes, teaching how to knit or how to build a bird house. Teaching grandchildren how to do something you enjoy builds a bond that they will always remember.
3. Become interested in and knowledgeable about their activities and hobbies.
If your grandchildren play sports, take some time to learn more about the sport that they play. If your grandchildren are involved in activities like 4H, Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts, ask them to be involved in upcoming events to learn more about what they are doing in the organization.
4. Put together a family album.
Get creative with this activity. Include more than just pictures—write down stories from your life to include with the pictures. This is a great way to not only learn more about each other but also give them something that they can add to as they get older.
5. Learn about social media.
Spend some time learning about the new forms of social media that your grandchildren are using on a daily basis. Some of the most popular social media networks are Facebook, Twitter, Vine, Pinterest and Instagram. Knowing a bit about these social networks can help you talk to your grandchildren and also understand the way they communicate with friends.
6. Be open to your grandchildren’s ideas about the future.
Sit back and listen to the new ideas that your grandchildren share with you about how they see the future. It can be enlightening to hear them talk about their views on business practices, architecture, art, movies, music and more!
7. Create new beginnings together.
Do something together that neither one of you have done before. There are so many activities out there from zip lining to scuba diving, that you’re bound to find something that you’re both interested in trying. Doing something new together is an amazing experience that you can talk about forever.
8. Get to know your grandchildren’s friends and what they like to do together.
Give your grandchildren the motivation to talk with you about who they enjoy spending time with and what they like to do together.
9. Enter into their world.
Know their hobbies, likes and dislikes. If they enjoy shopping or fishing, make that activity something you are familiar with so that you can talk about it or even do it together.
10. Watch the movies and TV shows they want to watch.
Ask them about their favorite shows and movies then look in to them a little more. Find out what they’re about and maybe even watch a few of them. When you’re together, you can compare thoughts and perspectives on everything from the actors to the plot."
8,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/16-ways-to-enjoy-the-summer-season-with-the-senior-in-your-life/,"With vacation times and the kids out of school, it may be hard to think of fun things to do with seniors. Of course, it can depend on the weather, where you live and the level of mobility of the senior. However, it’s important that seniors continue to be as mentally and physically active as possible. At FirstLight Home Care, we interact with seniors daily – here’s some fun things to keep the boredom away:
- Watch the sunset or sunrise. Because many seniors do not sleep as long, they can be early birds. Bring their favorite coffee or donut and just enjoy the view.
- Senior love to reminisce. Pull out the old photo albums and laugh at the old hairdos and fashions. Chances are, each picture will bring a fond memory.
- If you live close to a beach or lake, take a jaunt along the water – many have wheelchair accessible paths.
- Plan a barbecue where you serve their favorite foods. For one night, don’t worry about calories (unless they have strict diet restrictions). Make an old family favorite recipe – one you haven’t served in a long time!
- Do they like to read? Read a chapter from a book each time you visit. Or take out a fun magazine and read articles on topics they are interested in. Audio books are great for seniors.
- Go to a summer parade (like for the Fourth of July) or a place that has fireworks. Take a comfortable lawn chair and some sunscreen.
- Go to a garage sale or flea market. Inevitably they will find something that reminds them of their childhood. Give them $5 and tell them to go crazy!
- Have a family reunion and invite both families, neighbors and friends. Make them the center of attention.
- Go to an outdoor music concert – many areas have them for free. Take a sack lunch or dinner with their favorite fast food … and don’t forget the ice cream!
- Plant a garden. Raised beds and planters make it easier for seniors to reach. And what tastes better than home-grown tomatoes?
- Set up bird feeders in the back yard. Everybody loves watching baby birds!
- Go swimming. Many senior centers and fitness facilities offer water aerobics classes specifically designed for seniors. Water naturally reduces excessive heat and the water’s buoyancy makes it easy for seniors to move.
- Get them in on the video craze. Seniors are getting more interested in electronic games, in particular Wii Bowling. There are even Wii Bowling leagues and tournaments just for senior citizens. This way they don’t have to lug around a heavy ball.
- Take in a movie, especially on a hot afternoon when the prices are lower and the air conditioning feels great!
- Set a goal to learn something new together…it is great for the brain! Take an art class or watch a cooking show and get busy in the kitchen … together.
- Go “mall walking”. Many malls offer early hours when the mall is open specifically for walkers, but you can also go stroll around any time if you don’t mind the shoppers.
The main thing is to have fun and keep seniors safe!"
9,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/2012-best-holiday-gifts-for-seniors/,"It’s that time of year again when I rack my brain for what to get my parents and loved ones for the holidays. If I ask them what they want. I get the standard reply: “nothing, I have everything I want”. So I decided to do some research on the Internet to find out what’s hot, what’s new, and some standard tried and trues.
I knew that I wanted a gift that would keep them engaged and active. Definitely no dust collectors as our family home is chock full of doo dads and mementos!
- Wii. Who said video games are only for children and teenagers? Wrong! Studies have shown that the Nintendo Wii has been used in assisted living homes quite effectively to keep seniors fit. Games like Wii Sport, Wii Fit and Wii Brain Academy help to keep them physically and mentally in shape, and can
even help treat symptoms of conditions like Parkinson’s.
- Telekin computer. Probably the easiest computer on the market for seniors is the Telikin computer, which comes complete with video chat, photo sharing, email and many more popular features into a sleek, touchscreen device. It’s a great way for seniors to stay in touch and not be intimidated by the technology.
- Mobility. Do your parents have problems getting around? There are many dangers you don’t even realize that can result in falls. This website features mobility aides that help seniors to continue enjoying all the activities they have enjoyed throughout their lives.
- Cell phone. Do your parents want a simple cell phone with no contract to tie them up? Try the Jitterbug line of cell phones that have easy to see buttons, a
light screen, a loud speaker, simple menus, a built in camera, and a super long
battery.
- Home-made gift certificate. Create a personalized gift certificate where you treat your loved ones to a day of yard work, a top to bottom house cleaning, a home cooked meal or even a drive to anywhere they want.
- Audio books. If your parents have problems seeing, consider getting them an iPad or other tablet and pre-download an assortment of audio books they would like. Or if they still like the comfort of holding a book, a gift certificate to Amazon would be great. That way you are passing on the gift or learning.
- Reading.Have a book worm in your family? Consider a lighted magnifying
glass or a bean bag light lap desk to make it easier to read and see.
- Caregiving. Many seniors find it challenging to keep up with the day-to-day activities. Give the gift of caring – have a caregiver come into their home for a few hours a week and help with laundry, bill paying, cooking, etc.
- Cooking. Do you have a chef in the house? Make it easier to prepare day-to-day meals with this six-piece kitchen essentials set from Oxo. Each utensil features
soft, non-slip ergonomic hand grips and durable stainless steel heads. The set
includes a swivel peeler, can opener, grater, 9″ locking tongs, ice cream
scoop and 11″ balloon whisk.
- TV Ears. Does your house shake when your parents listen to the
TV? TV ears will cure that! This comfortable headset is lightweight and you’ll actually hear what is being said while others around you set the volume of the television to a pleasant level.
Whatever you do, put some thought and love into your gift … no stale fruitcakes!"
10,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/2018-national-caregiver-of-the-year/,"Cherise Knowlin,
FirstLight Home Care of The Grand Strand, South Carolina
We are so very proud and honored to share with you our 2018 National Caregiver of the Year award winner, Cherise Knowlin. Cherise was selected from more than 4,500 caregivers and was the only FirstLight employee nationwide to receive the honor. The award was presented during an annual gala at the recent FirstLight Home Care national conference in San Antonio, Texas.
Our caregivers are the heart and soul of our company. They breathe life into our Culture of Care and build meaningful relationships that provide help, joy and peace of mind to families across the nation. Caregiver of the Year nominees were evaluated based on a variety of criteria, including service excellence; quality of caregiving skills; and empathy, respect and compassion toward clients. Knowlin was nominated for the award by FirstLight Home Care of The Grand Strand General Manager Jamie Recupero, and owner Kristin Randall.
“Cherise is a one-of-a-kind caregiver,” said Jamie. “She is excellent at putting herself in others’ shoes and she will go out of her way to relate directly to a client’s needs. She will pick up any shift and show up at a client’s house with a smiling face, always looking professional.”
Kristin added, “Cherise is an extraordinary caregiver because she makes difficult situations better. She is loving, caring and compassionate and simply wants to make her client’s day the best it can be.”
FirstLight caregivers like Knowlin help seniors and other adults with many needs – from personal hygiene and household duties such as cooking, cleaning and running errands, to respite and dementia care.
Our finalists this year included Gladys Villa, Mount Kisco, Westchester, NY, and Denita Roberts, Tomball, TX.
See why Cherise is so deserving of this award in our 2018 Caregiver of the Year video. You can view additional videos featuring previous Caregiver of the Year award winners to learn more about our extraordinary people and what it means to be a FirstLight caregiver."
11,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/3-benefits-respite-care/,"In a matter of moments, your responsibilities in life can shift from those of a full-time employee, to an unpaid caregiver. Whether it’s for an aging parent or recovering sibling, voluntary family aid is estimated to be worth $375 billion a year and 29 percent of Americans provide some sort of care to ill, disabled or aging family members or friends.
While there’s no doubt you care deeply for your loved ones, caregiving is often a full-time job that can impact your personal wellbeing and work performance. However, you may not feel comfortable signing away complete caregiving responsibilities to a professional caretaker or nursing home – this is where respite care can help. This service is designed to offer you temporary relief by having a professional caregiver come in and tend to your loved ones so you can deal with other aspects of your life.
Here are three benefits of investing in respite care services:
- Increased time: Without help, family caregivers tend to spend 20 hours a week taking care of their loved ones. Respite care gives you time back so you can focus on your daily commitments while your loved ones are cared for at the same time.
- Decreased stress: From physical, emotional and financial stress, caregiving can be tough, especially if you’re juggling work and family at the same time. Respite care can help you rest and relax when you need it most. In fact, 98 percent of family caregivers said the service increased their ability to provide a less stressful environment at home, according to the Oklahoma Respite Resource Network.
- Better health: Family caregivers tend to forego their personal health for the sake of their loved ones, ultimately leading to increased illness. Respite care can help you stay healthy by giving you more time to rest. Even if it’s just four hours per week, 64 percent of family caregivers reported improved physical health while 78 percent claimed better emotional health as a result of respite care.
As a family caregiver, it’s okay to want time to yourself as everyone deserves the opportunity to take a break. To find out more about the benefits of respite care, contact your local FirstLight Home Care today. Our caregivers are specially trained to help you help your loved ones."
12,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/3-great-reasons-to-become-a-caregiver-today/,"“There are only four kinds of people in this world: those who have been a caregiver, those who are currently a caregiver, those who will be a caregiver and those who will need a caregiver. Caregiving is universal.”- Rosalynn Carter, Former First Lady of the United States
According to the National Alliance for Caregiving and the AARP Public Policy Institute, over 40 million Americans are providing care for an adult family member or friend. Additionally, the number of new career opportunities for care jobs will be over 1 million by 2028, which would grow the current care workforce by 46%. (SOURCE: Home Health Care)
Caregiving is an admirable profession. Becoming a non-medical caregiver can be a great choice for anyone looking for a new, rewarding career. The work is challenging, but it provides immense satisfaction knowing that the work you do helps others, especially now when care at home has become even more essential to so many individuals.
Here are three great reasons to become a caregiver today.
YOU CAN MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE. Caregivers provide a tremendous service to families with an aging parent or a family member living with a disability. As a caregiver, you provide many services to those in your care, including conversation and company, meal preparation, help with household tasks, errands and transportation. This in-home support ensures clients enjoy warmth, independence and comfort in the place they call home. A caregiver’s genuine desire to make a real difference helps to enrich their clients’ lives and make the world a better place. Compassionate caregivers can truly change the lives of those they care for.
YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP PEOPLE. Caregivers help people who genuinely need care in their daily lives. They allow aging seniors and other adults to live happy, fulfilling lives in familiar surroundings. The services you offer as a caregiver truly help others, and the ongoing interactions with those in your care (and even with their families) help combat loneliness and isolation and build relationships that enhance the lives of everyone involved.
Numerous studies have shown that people with stronger social networks have lower rates of depression, better physical health and longer lives. Other studies have been even more specific; one found that older people who were more socially active had significantly less cognitive decline over a 12-year period than those who were more isolated. (SOURCE: American Psychological Association
YOU GET TO ENJOY A CAREER WITH MANY BENEFITS. Caregiving is an incredibly rewarding career, and it can provide a great sense of purpose in life. Whether you’re looking for your first job in-home care, or you simply want to be the joy in a senior’s life, caregiving can be an exceptional opportunity. Becoming a professional in-home caregiver has its perks, including:
- Flexible schedules
- Hands-on training
- Competitive pay
- Growth opportunities in a booming industry
- Working with a team of compassionate people who, like you, want to make a difference
- The ability to form bonds with the person in your care and their families to improve the quality of everyone’s lives
If you want to advance your career and form meaningful relationships in the lives of others, you might be a perfect candidate to become an in-home caregiver. We have local caregiving teams all over the United States. If you have a heart for service, a passion for assisting the elderly and a genuine desire to care for others, then our locations want to talk with you.
Regardless of any situation, the safety and well-being of our caregivers and clients is our top priority."
13,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/3-reasons-caregiving-is-so-hard/,"Caring for a loved one strains even the most resilient people.
At FirstLight® we have found that family caregivers tend to be very compassionate people that only want to provide what is best for the loved one in their care. They appreciate the satisfaction and fulfillment that comes with taking care of someone, but the shift in parental roles and the emotions connected to an aging or ailing loved one can change the dynamics of any situation.
Caregiving is hard work. It can involve many stressors. Over the last 10 years working with families, our local caregivers have found these three common reasons why caregiving is so hard.
It can cause stress and burnout. As a family caregiver, you may be so focused on your loved one that you don’t realize that your own health and well-being are suffering. Watch for these signs of caregiver stress and burnout:
- Feeling overwhelmed or constantly worried
- Feeling tired all the time
- Sleeping too much (or not enough)
- Gaining or losing a substantial amount of weight
- Becoming easily irritated or angry
- Losing interest in activities you used to enjoy
- Having frequent headaches, bodily pain or other physical problems
- Abusing alcohol or drugs, including prescription medications
Too much stress, especially over a long stretch of time, can harm your health. Check out these caregiver tips to help you reduce the stress that you may be feeling and to help improve the caring experience.
It can impact your relationships. When you become the family caregiver, the assistance your loved one needs may not be as demanding at first, but that may change over time. As the care needs change, so will the time commitment and additional help that is required of you. When this occurs, it can directly impact your relationship with your spouse or partner. Your needs and those of your family may fall by the wayside. While a healthy relationship can endure in the presence of stress, it’s important for you and your partner to make personal time a priority.
- Caregivers need time away from their caring responsibilities. Allow for regular respite care in order to spend quality time with your partner and yourself in meaningful ways.
- Keep the lines of communication open between you and your partner.
- Make it a point to give your spouse and your relationship your “best” every day.
It can be difficult to watch your loved one’s health deteriorate. Seeing someone who used to be healthy, strong and full of life now in poor health can be tough. For many family caregivers, the thought of losing a loved one can be more stressful than their day-to-day caregiving responsibilities. Caregivers are at substantial risk for anxiety, depression and chronic disease as they watch their loved one’s mental and physical abilities decline.
Research from The Caregiver Health Effects Study found that high levels of inflammation and depressive symptoms can last for years after caregiving responsibilities have ended. Caregiving can consume so many hours of each day for many years that when it comes to an end, there is sadness and feelings of vacancy in your life. There are things – both before and after caregiving ends – that the family caregiver can do for an easier transition to come out on the other side with a stronger sense of themselves. Here are some ideas that AARP recommends:
Start planning now: Your caregiving obligations will not go on indefinitely. Try to look ahead and plan for your post-caregiving life sooner rather than later.
Embrace how you have changed: Consider how your caregiving experience has changed you — perhaps it made you more compassionate and hopeful, more knowing and capable. See caregiving as a source of lessons that will help you the rest of your life.
Use your new skills: Through managing pillboxes, deciphering insurance statements and communicating with aides, physicians and difficult relatives, caregivers learn skills that are frequently overlooked, including organization, technical know-how and negotiation skills. Those abilities have value for effectively navigating the complexities of families and our complicated health care and social service systems.
Relish the values: The values instilled in you by caregiving will have increased your tolerance for frustration and self-sacrifice and your will to make a positive difference in the lives of others. Those are the same values at the heart of being an admirable grandparent, boss and citizen. When the going gets tough again in life — and it probably will — you will have the confidence to handle it because you have done so before.
Caregiving is often a full-time job that can impact your health and well-being, job performance and overall life balance. It can lead to stress, anger or resentment, and it sometimes can feel like the relationship you have with the family member in your care is now an obligation.

As we age, everyday tasks get harder from complications with mobility, vision, and other underlying health factors. While some elderly adults have health concerns that can impact their lifestyles, many live fully independent. However, for elderly diabetics, day-to-day activities like managing blood glucose levels, taking an abundance of medications and eating an adequate diet can all be strenuous. To give families peace of mind for their senior loved one with diabetes, find out how having an in-home caregiver is the perfect solution to ensure they maintain a healthy lifestyle.
Having a caregiver in the home can:
Help Manage Blood Sugar Levels & Diabetic Medication
Maintaining an elderly diabetic’s blood sugar level is a full-time job. Having a caregiver present in the senior’s life will make managing this easier. Many diabetics have to take oral diabetes medications to help control blood sugar levels. For elderly adults, it can be hard to stick to a regular medication schedule and a caregiver can help by providing medication reminders. While your elderly loved one may generally be self-sufficient in their health-related responsibilities, there may also be sudden spikes or drops in their blood glucose that may leave them disoriented and unable to get the proper help. Having constant home care available allows their blood sugar levels and medication to be monitored, organized and adjusted accordingly, leaving no room for error.
Assist Elderly Diabetics with Vision & Mobility Limitations
Home care is essential for elderly adults with diabetes because this disease worsens complications with their vision and nerve endings. If the elder has been living with diabetes for a long time, it’s common for them to have nerve damage in their feet, making it hard for them to walk. They may also develop diabetic retinopathy, which is damage to the retina causing blindness. These side effects disrupt daily life and heighten possible risk factors, such as falling. However, if they have a caregiver that keeps their blood sugar in a healthy range, these risk factors will decrease. Your elderly family member will have the constant help they need so eye or nerve damage is not an issue, and any additional medical conditions, like diabetic retinopathy, can be prevented.
Help Seniors with Diabetes Maintain Healthy Meal Plans
One of the critical factors that affect elders’ blood glucose levels is diet. Home care support is one way to ensure the senior is getting adequate nutrition for their health needs. For instance, an older adult with diabetes should eat foods low in carbohydrates and high in protein and fat. Home care providers can step in and take the senior to the grocery store, prepare meals with them, and help them budget accordingly for what they need. All the while, elderly adults can learn how these healthy diet options help manage their diabetes, so they live longer and healthier.
Hiring a professional caregiver can ensure your loved one takes the steps necessary to manage their diabetes and stay as healthy as possible. Your elderly loved one will live a life of comfort, happiness and fun without family members worrying about their overall health and quality of life.

15,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/3-springtime-caregiving-tips-need-know/,"With spring officially here and even warmer weather right around the corner, outdoor activities and fun in the sun are surely on your mind. But what about your loved ones in need – how can they enjoy spring and avoid being cooped up during this popular season?
For caregivers around the nation, both family and professionals, spring is the perfect time to invigorate the men and women they care for. However, it’s important to be mindful of limitations and conditions so everyone can benefit from the beautiful scenery and fresh air. Here are three springtime caregiving tips that will help you and your loved ones enjoy the great outdoors:
- Try gardening: This low-impact activity has been shown to offer a wealth of health benefits to individuals, especially seniors. The National Diabetes Education Program lists it as one of the five ways older adults can be more physically active and for individuals with Alzheimer’s, gardening is a great way to connect with them that’s safe and secure. Because gardening can be a community activity, it’s a perfect pastime for caregivers to actively connect with their loved ones.
- Go for a walk: For older individuals or even those recovering from injuries, walking can be one of the most powerful springtime activities. The Arthritis Foundation cites numerous benefits of walking such as improved circulation, a 40 percent reduced risk for hip fractures, improved mood, healthier weight, stronger joints and diminished mental decline.
- Spring clean: Winter tends to result in accumulated gifts and clutter throughout the house. For in-home care recipients, now’s the time caregivers can lend a helping hand with spring cleaning. This not only keeps your loved ones active, it also creates a safer environment for seniors and in-need adults to move around the house. By taking your time and reminiscing over keepsakes, you and your loved ones can also turn spring cleaning into an enjoyable activity.
Springtime is the perfect opportunity for families around the nation to do something different and energize their loved ones in need. We also understand that everyone needs a little assistance sometimes, which is why our highly-trained caregivers are available to help your loved ones enjoy all spring has to offer. To find out more, contact your local FirstLight Home Care today."
16,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/4-healthy-ways-handle-stress/,"Stress is a universal problem that’s more than just a nuisance. The American Institute of Stress indicates that not only is stress the basic cause of 60 percent of all human illnesses and disease, but it causes 10 percent of strokes, three out of four doctor visits, and reduced grey matter in regions of the brain tied to emotional and physiological functions. Being able to properly handle stress is an important way to help maintain overall good health.
Because stress is so damaging, April is Stress Awareness Month and everyone, from teenagers to retirees, are encouraged to recognize what causes stress in their lives and manage it in healthy ways. As national caregivers, we see the negative side effects of stress firsthand and offer these four ways to reduce it in your life and the lives of your loved ones.
- Write things down: As we age, our minds will tend to forget little things, leading to frustration and increased stress. Even the cause of stress can be forgotten, creating a new challenge for you and your aging loved ones. We recommend writing things down, including to-do lists, medication reminders, and even answers to problems that may be cluttering your mind. Putting thoughts on paper can help you see solutions much clearer to help reduce daily stress.
- Exercise: Physical activity brings a number of benefits to your life, including reduced stress. The American Psychological Association cites that 53 percent of adults feel better about themselves after exercising, 35 percent say it puts them in a good mood, and 62 percent that say they exercise as a stress management tool, claiming it to be very or extremely effective. Exercise is also very important for seniors to maintain an active and healthy quality of life.
- Be social: When stress starts to grow, confiding in a family member, friend or companion can help reduce it and bring your emotional state back to a healthy level. Social activity can also help support mental health and keep aging adults sharp.
- Find a furry friend: When stress and depression levels are high, animals can help lighten your mood and bring a slice of happy to your world. Playing with dogs and cats can increase calming levels of serotonin and dopamine, and in individuals 65-years-old and older, pets have been shown to help reduce doctor visits by 30 percent.
Stress is a dangerous ailment, especially for our aging loved ones. Having in-home and companion care can help by offering a service that builds a culture of care in the comfort of your family’s home. To discover more ways to manage stress for your loved ones, make sure to “Just Ask FirstLight.” Our helpful caregiving team can help answer the tough questions you’ll have as an acting caregiver yourself."
17,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/4-ideas-assist-seniors-july-4th/,"Next Monday is Independence Day in the United States and this would be a great time to enjoy a festive 4th with the seniors in your life! With summer heat bearing down this July, there are certain things to keep in mind before heading out to celebrate the July 4th holiday.
As caregivers, we know that the warm summer temperatures, the cacophony of July 4th and large groups of people that come together during holidays can be tough for seniors. Whether you are heading out to a large celebration or just staying home, use these tips to make sure that everyone has a safe and enjoyable holiday!
- Be prepared: If the seniors in your life want to enjoy a traditional outdoor celebration, make activities friendlier to enhance the day. Having a cool shaded area during the heat of the day for seniors to stay out of the sun, bringing a portable chair to relax in and ensuring your senior family members stay hydrated can help keep your festivities going all day long!
- Enjoy a traditional barbecue: Barbecues are always a great family time, so if possible, throw a backyard barbecue and invite family and friends to enjoy the day with your seniors. Serving hot dogs, hamburgers, potato salad and other fun foods for the 4th will allow everyone to enjoy the holiday together. Get your senior family members involved by asking them to help with decorations or food preparation to get them into the spirit of the day!
- Be understanding: If your senior family members have dietary or sun exposure restrictions, do what you can to try and ease any self-consciousness that they may have. If you need to cut up their food before they eat, take care of that away from others so that your seniors aren’t embarrassed. If you are worried that they are getting overheated in the hot sun, bring them inside to cool down and sit with them so they aren’t alone. Some seniors might feel obligated to stay with the family and not bring attention to themselves, but being understanding of their needs can help keep them and your family comfortable throughout the day!
- Bring the party indoors: If the seniors in the family are unable or uncomfortable with being outside, bring the party indoors for them. Watching patriotic movies, enjoying fireworks displays on TV or listening to some favorite songs can help seniors enjoy the day, even if they aren’t able to spend time outdoors.
Spending time together with your senior family members this July 4th holiday can be a wonderfully rewarding experience for them and your family. Regardless of what you do this Independence Day, sharing the experience with the seniors in your life can make this holiday a great day for everyone. If you have a question about the best way to prepare for the July 4th holiday, or other topics related to caregiving, contact our “Just Ask FirstLight” service today for more information!"
18,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/4-quick-alzheimers-communication-tips/,"Did you know that 1 in 9 people ages 65 and older has Alzheimer’s disease? Alzheimer’s changes the way that your loved ones communicate. Some caregivers may not see very many differences, but others may notice that it becomes increasingly difficult to communicate with loved ones with Alzheimer’s.
There are some common communication changes that caregivers may notice as Alzheimer’s disease progresses. You might hear your loved one repeating familiar words, speaking in their native language or mixing up the order of words in a sentence. They may also have trouble communicating their feelings or speak less often than usual.
Here’s a few quick tips for communicating effectively with your loved one with Alzheimer’s or dementia:
1. Watch non-verbal communication.
It is often hard for those with Alzheimer’s or dementia to communicate what they’re feeling. Instead of talking about their feelings or illnesses, they resort to non-verbal cues. Symptoms like a headache may come out as a different behavior like rocking in a rocking chair or pacing around the room. Or, if they feel threatened by someone in the room with them they could start to withdraw, bend over in their chair or cross their arms and legs. They feel insecure about not knowing how to communicate their feelings and that insecurity turns into a physical response.
2. Don’t get stuck in repetition.
When you notice that your loved one is continually repeating words or stories, you have to do something to break the communication cycle. The best way to break the cycle is to do something physical. Get them up and moving—maybe brushing their teeth or hair, helping with a project or folding laundry.
3. Don’t try to constantly bring them back to the present.
While it may be helpful to remind them of the date or current events at times, it is not necessary to do it every time your loved one is confused. Try to communicate with them where they are instead. The easiest way to do that is to use simple, direct sentences like “time to go upstairs and go to bed” or “it’s time for dinner; take a seat at the table.”
4. The key to great conversation is the past.
Talk to your loved one about events and things that happened in the past. Conversation will begin to flow easily. Many of their memories are from the past and it is fun for them to reminisce about times that they remember so clearly.
Communicating with loved ones who have Alzheimer’s or dementia can be frustrating, but with some adaptations, communication can be enjoyable again. People with dementia do not remember who you are but they do remember how you make them feel! Make them feel purposeful so they can have a wonderful feeling today and every day. What are some tips you have for other caregivers or family members that are caring for loved ones with Alzheimer’s or dementia?"
19,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/4-reasons-respite-care-is-necessary-for-family-caregivers/,"For the family caregiver, taking care of an elderly or chronically ill family member, or a loved one with a disability, is something that you do out of love, compassion and desire for a meaningful connection to the person you love. But caregiving is a demanding job. It can be all-consuming and exhausting as you try to navigate the healthcare system, manage appointments, advocate for the care receiver, and take care of their growing day-to-day needs…all while trying to do those same things for yourself and your family.
Respite care, or temporary relief from your caregiving tasks, is critical. As the demand for a loved one’s care increases, oftentimes family caregivers feel inundated with responsibilities, and sometimes they may even feel guilty for needing some time to themselves. A family caregiver can experience burnout from his or her duties, so taking time off must be a priority.
Here is why respite care is essential for family caregivers:
It allows them to continue to work full time. Many family caregivers must decide between working their paying job or caring for their loved one full-time. Most often they cannot do both, and they are not financially situated to leave their full-time job. Having a home care provider come to your elderly parent’s home to provide respite and look after them while you are at work can bring peace of mind to everyone.
Taking short breaks helps maintain physical and emotional health. Caregivers need to frequently recharge and rejuvenate. Respite care provides a chance to practice self-care – take a yoga class, see their doctor, read a book or take a nap. Time away allows the caregiver to unwind, gain a fresh perspective and develop better ways of caring for their loved one.
It lets caregivers stay connected to family and friends. Taking a break from caring for others gives you an opportunity to carve out time for your family and friends. Respite care helps you maintain your sense of self and it allows you to stay social on a regular basis.
Respite gives back time in their day to do the things they enjoy. Respite care allows the family caregiver to do something they enjoy, even if it means simply sitting down at home to read a book. Taking time to do a hobby or something you love can greatly improve your mood and bring a sense of calm to your life.
The most important benefits of using respite care include relieving stress, renewing your energy, and restoring a sense of balance to your personal life. Taking a break from being a caregiver to focus on yourself, your other responsibilities and your own family is key to keeping a healthy lifestyle while caring for a loved one.
Contact us for more information on how FirstLight’s Respite Care Services can give you peace of mind while you take some time off to focus on yourself for a while. Respite care from FirstLight can last anywhere from just a few hours per day to weeks at a time. Our local caregivers have solutions that are right for you.
FirstLight Home Care is proud to CHAMPION the family caregiver, offering empathy, advice, and support for those who provide countless hours of care to their loved ones living with Alzheimer’s. We want to provide a helping hand, relieve some of the stress that comes with caregiving, and give you back a few hours in your overwhelmingly busy day."
20,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/4-things-to-elder-proof-your-bathroom/,"Each year thousands* of people over the age of 55 are injured in the bathroom due to simple slip and falls while in the bath or using the bathroom. As the aging become more fragile or health problems and side effects from medications can increase chances of injury, there are simple additions you can make in their bathroom to reduce the risk of injuries or even death.
Safety-Rails: Install grab bars by the toilet and in the shower. These need to be properly installed so they are secure enough to support weight. Also consider using shower chairs and bath benches to help avoid someone falling in the bathtub.
Non-Slip Strips/Mats: Avoid falls in the bath or shower by applying non-slip strips to the floor of the bathing surface. Don’t forget to purchase a non-skid mat for directly outside of the shower stall or bathtub.
Lighting: Increase the wattage of bulbs in the bathroom for better visibility. Add a nightlight in the bathroom, and consider putting additional nightlights or motion lighting along the path from the bedroom to the bathroom.
Raised Toilet Seat: Current toilets can either be modified with a raised toilet seat, or replaced entirely with a higher toilet. A raised toilet can be a huge improvement for older knees.
These simple additions can help prevent unnecessary slip and falls. Do you have a suggestion to help keep an elderly person be safe in the bathroom, add your comment below, or join in the conversation on Facebook.

21,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/4-tips-to-ease-caregiver-stress/,"The responsibilities and challenges of caring for a loved one can place significant stress on the family caregiver. In fact, this stress can build up and cause caregiver distress—a situation where the caregiver may become more susceptible to other health risks, including depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, and nagging health problems such as headaches.
To help family caregivers combat this potential for caregiver distress, our Ask Nurse Gina has five tips to help reduce Caregiver Stress.
Exercise: When schedules get busy, exercise is usually the first thing to go. Make sure the caregiver in your family has time each day for some form of physical activity. Whether that is taking a daily walk, caring for a garden, taking a yoga class at the neighborhood gym or bicycling through the park with friends, caregivers need to have time to exercise.
Sleep: Everyone needs a full night’s sleep. Sleep isn’t just a luxury; it’s essential for your health and well-being. The family caregiver should try to get at least seven hours a night. If the person you are caring for gets up at night, then the caregiver needs to ask someone to take a few nights a week so they can get the necessary rest they need.
Hire help. Many caregivers find themselves taking on the caregiving role alone. Caring for someone is a big job. If other family members are not as involved, then ask them for help. Be very specific in the help you need. If family and friends are not local or unable to help, then hire help, even if it’s part-time or a couple days per week.Check out the services FirstLight Home Care can provide your family caregiver.
Find a community. Caregivers need to know that they are not alone. Interacting with others who are going through what you’re going through can be a huge help to reduce caregiver stress. Support groups can help connect you to others, as well as to care giving resources.
Caregiving can have many rewards. For most caregivers, being there when a loved one needs you is a core value and something you wish to provide. If you can reduce the stress that your family caregiver can go through you will improve the caring experience.

22,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/4-ways-caregivers-can-cope-with-alzheimers-during-the-holidays/,"The holidays can be tough for families affected by Alzheimer’s or other dementias. Your loved one living with Alzheimer’s may experience confusion or anxiety, especially with the additional hustle and bustle of the holiday season. And that could put added stress on families.
Our local FirstLight® caregivers shared these tips to help make the holidays merry, bright and, most of all, memorable for family caregivers and the people in their care.
Create a safe and calm space. It’s easy to go all out during the holiday with decorations, blinking lights, music and loud gatherings.
- Simplify holiday decorations. Avoid blinking lights or large decorative displays that can cause angst or confusion.
- Steer clear of decorations that add clutter or require you to rearrange a room that is already familiar to your loved one.
- Be careful of potential safety hazards. Substitute burning candles for battery operated ones. Avoid fragile decorations or those that could be mistaken for edible treats, such as artificial fruits or candy.
- Be considerate of your loved ones by paying close attention to their needs. Anyone living with Alzheimer’s will tire easily and can become agitated with a lack of sleep. They may need to lie down for a while and get some rest.
- Provide a quiet place for the person with Alzheimer’s to have time alone or to visit with one person at a time.
Modify your holiday traditions. Identify holiday activities that your loved one can easily manage and that you both would enjoy.
- Do crafts, such as decorating cookies or writing holiday cards, or binge-watch all your favorite holiday movies. Focus on the quality of time spent together rather than the outcome.
- Keep things more casual and relaxed. Host smaller family gatherings or limit the number of visitors stopping by throughout any given day.
- Maintain your existing daily schedule and routine to keep things consistent.
- Keep outings brief and be prepared to leave early if your loved one becomes tired, confused or overwhelmed.
Prepare holiday visitors. For many guests, this may be the first time they’ve interacted with the individual living with Alzheimer’s. Or perhaps it’s just been a while since they’ve seen them. Before your guests arrive:
- Share with them any changes in behavior or memory since their last visit.
- Offer communication tips. Suggest ways for guests to listen patiently, including not criticizing repeated comments, not correcting errors and not interrupting.
Remember self-care. This is crucial for caregivers – whether it is the holidays or not. We have found these tips to be the most helpful for making any season enjoyable:
- Don’t over commit. Pick and choose the holiday activities that will be most meaningful for you and the loved one in your care.
- Set realistic expectations on what you can do over the holidays and be comfortable saying “no” to family and friends when your schedule has reached its limits.
- List out everything that needs to be completed during the holidays and prioritize what you can do, then delegate to family, friends, and local professionals to help with everything else.
- Make time for yourself. Do what brings you joy!
- Ask for help. If you do not have family close by, we’re here for you.
If you need help tackling all the things that come with the holiday season, contact us. Our local compassionate caregivers can provide respite care services and elder care solutions at home or any setting for a couple of hours, an entire day, overnight, or even longer-term if needed now and throughout the New Year.
We are proud to CHAMPION the family caregiver, offering empathy, advice, and support for those who provide countless hours of care to their loved ones living with Alzheimer’s. We want to provide a helping hand, relieve some of the stress that comes with caregiving and give you back a few hours in your overwhelmingly busy day."
23,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/41-billion-problem-hospital-readmissions/,"Before the enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), hospitals were not penalized for patient readmission within the first 30 days of a discharge. This led to the American healthcare system spending $41.3 billion dollars in just 11 months to treat readmitted individuals. Today, even with the ACA’s readmission penalty, hospitalization makes up nearly a third of the $2 trillion spent on healthcare.
While some readmissions are unavoidable, a large number can be prevented. This means at-risk individuals such as seniors, adults with disabilities, those recovering from injuries and veterans should be safeguarded from hospitalizations. Here are a few ways you and your loved ones can avoid hospital readmissions:
- Manage medication adherence: When individuals don’t take prescriptions the way they should, especially those with chronic diseases, it can result in up to $300 billion in unnecessary healthcare spending and hospitalizations. This issue can be remedied by making sure you and your love ones not only take medication according to the directions, but get prescriptions filled and refilled in a timely manner.
- Consider telehealth: As telemedicine advances, so does the opportunity to reduce hospital readmissions. In fact, the use of telehealth could save as much $6 billion a year on healthcare spending according to a Towers Watson study. It’s important to ask your doctor what options are available to engage with them digitally and monitor your vitals remotely. Some telehealth options today are even covered by insurance.
- Try in-home care: One of the best ways to avoid hospital readmissions is daily monitoring during the first month of returning home. However, if you’re tasked with taking care of a loved one while working a full-time job, or simply don’t have the training to be a caregiver, this can prove difficult. Certified in-home caregivers are trained to look for symptoms and signs of a potential hospitalization and can help handle health problems proactively.
When a loved one returns from the hospital, your main goal should be a comfortable recovery. Avoiding readmissions can help prolong their health, but doing so can be difficult, especially without experienced help. That’s why our CNA caregivers are specially trained to reduce hospital readmissions and help you better handle in-home care. To find out more, contact your local FirstLight Home Care today."
24,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/5-activities-to-keep-elderly-parents-active-and-engaged/,"Staying healthy and feeling your best is important at any age, but it’s especially important for seniors. Studies have shown that being active as we age is crucial for physical, mental and emotional health.
Do you have elderly parents who could use a little encouragement when it comes to staying active and engaged? Here are five pieces of sage advice to help get them out, about and enjoying life.
Encourage them to lend a helping hand: Volunteer opportunities, depending on your parent’s skills and mobility, are a great way for them to stay active and engaged. While opportunities may look a little different due to the pandemic, there may be causes that still need help.
There are many options for older adults who have retired and have more time on their hands. Sixty and Me wrote this helpful post that takes a look at how seniors can get started with volunteering and why they should.
Volunteering also could help your parents feel connected to the community. And in turn, this feeling of value brings many mental and physical benefits.
Give them the resources to stay occupied while at home: Many elderly people spend all day alone in their homes without company or entertainment. While you might not always be with your parents during the day, you can help keep them occupied with activities such as audiobooks, CDs, radio shows, puzzles, hobbies, and anything else you think they might enjoy during the times you are not there.
Keep them moving: Local park districts and senior centers offer exercise groups tailored to older adults. These classes, group walks, and special outings encourage daily exercise. And, they not only provide physical activity but also foster friendships.
Get them a furry friend: If your loved one can handle the care and financial responsibilities associated with owning a pet, a new animal companion like a cat or dog, could be a great addition to their household. There are thousands of animals in local animal shelters looking for their forever home and getting a furry for your parents could provide the sense of purpose, responsibility and love your aging family member needs.
Keep them social: Help your aging parents stay connected to other family members, neighbors, and friends. Help them set up social events and activities that include inviting people to visit them at their home, as well as those that give them opportunities to go out and see others.
There are many ways to keep an elderly parent active and engaged. But if the challenge is getting them to their social activities and making certain they’re safe during their planned events, we can help. Our Companion Care Services provide a wide range of solutions to help keep your aging loved one active, engaged and enjoying life.

26,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/5-best-ways-to-keep-your-heart-healthy/,"Lifestyle and family history both play an important role in the health of your heart. As we all know, living with heart disease or any other heart condition may be ultimately debilitating and decrease your life span. The good thing from all this, is that most heart conditions can be prevented and/or managed if you know the proper lifestyle adjustments required. Explained, are five of the best ways to keep your heart healthy.
- Know your family history. Heart conditions do run in the family, and the earlier you know there is history of heart conditions, the sooner you can work to prevent it from happening to you. Make sure to inform your physician of any history of heart disease, such as high blood pressure or cholesterol, or any other irregular heart condition patterns seen in your family.
- Keep your diet on track. There are a number of ways to make sure you are following heart healthy guidelines within your diet. A balanced diet is important, and there are many foods that are recommended to stay away from. A great source to find this information is www.cdc.gov
- Inactivity is a major risk factor for heart disease. Those who are inactive have a 35% greater risk of high blood pressure. Exercise makes the heart stronger, which in turn allows it to pump blood more readily throughout your body. A vigorous exercise program shows the most decreased risk of heart disease, but any exercise will benefit your heart and your health.
- Don’t Smoke! Smoking is one of the most significant risk factors. Smoking can damage blood vessels and other parts of the heart’s functions.
- Get regular health screenings. It is important to have a physical yearly and to include screens for high blood pressure and cholesterol. Many insurance companies will set up time at the work place to also do this type of screening. Schedule whatever works best from you and make sure to keep up to date information on your heart’s health.
Maintaining a healthy heart should be a first priority in life. Consider it a positive lifestyle
change, and embrace the healthy living that goes along with it."

They’re traveling the world, and it’s okay to be a little green with envy. It used to be the young and responsibility-free who were crisscrossing the world, but this trend is changing. The Frequent Flying and Global Trekking Older Travel Report shows seniors (55 and older) are now the ones globetrotting compared to those under 55. Older travelers are becoming much more adventurous and tech-savvy than they are given credit for and they’re filling their days with global travel.
The 2017 report also found that those between the ages of 55 and 64 were the only segment to increase long-haul travel between 2012 and 2016 (an increase of more than 19 percent). And it seems as people get older, they only want to travel more often. Those over 65 are the most prolific travelers of the 55 and older market, with 28 percent indulging in two international trips per year.
They’re moving in together, and they’re not thinking about marriage. Finding your true love can happen more than once. But it doesn’t always mean a walk down the aisle. Seniors living together is now trending! Unmarried seniors – widowed, single or divorcee – are cohabiting. According to U.S. Census Bureau data, cases of unmarried couples living together is rising rapidly in the US. There were already 18.5 million in 2017 and that number is expected to climb in the coming years. And most of these unmarried couples are older adults.
They’re embracing technology. Smartphone adoption among seniors has nearly quadrupled in the last four years. Based on Pew Research Center data, 93 percent of those aged 70 to 74 reported owning a cell phone, with half of them owning a smartphone. Similarly, 63 percent of those aged 75 to 79 said they own a cell phone, with about one-third having a smartphone. And 58 percent of those 80+ reported owning a cell phone, with 17 percent of them having a smartphone.
The next most frequently-used technology was the internet, with 75 percent of respondents aged 70 to 74, 60 percent of those 75 to 79 and 44 percent of those aged 80+ reporting using it. Regarding social media use, 41 percent of those aged 70 to 74, and 24 percent of those aged 75 to 79 actively use social media to engage with family, friends and the outside world.
They’re reinventing themselves, and it’s not a money thing. Most people retire in their 60s, and many retirees have a lot of life left in them and don’t want to sit still. The new trend is to find a meaningful purpose to fill their days. That could mean going back to work, but this time, going back to do something they love. Seniors are starting their own businesses or purchasing a franchise business and drawing from their years of life and work experience to drive their success. Some are going back to school to earn a master’s degree, and some are just learning for pleasure. Seniors are reinventing themselves by becoming models, artists, running marathons, teaching, volunteering, and going into public office. Some seniors are even becoming caregivers, especially as home care agencies such as FirstLight are tapping into an older workforce willing to care for clients older or closer to them in age on a part-time basis.
They’re staying fit, and it looks good on them. Although there is still room for improvement, the trend in 2018 is that more seniors are adding exercise to their daily routine to maintain their quality of life. Endless studies have proven that exercise plays a crucial role in the health and happiness of those over 55. Recent reports from the National Institute on Aging found that more than 35 percent of adults 75 years or older are physically active, and nearly 30 percent of seniors aged 65 to 74 are physically active. Here’s what they’re doing:
- Yoga, the most popular form of exercise for older adults. It provides both mental and physical benefits, helps with arthritis, flexibility and blood pressure, and it offers relaxation and stress reduction.
- Walking clubs mix socialization with exercise. Walking improves circulation, lowers blood pressure and benefits the heart.
- Balance-oriented and weight lifting classes to help prevent falls.
- Water-based exercises include swimming, pool walking, and water aerobics. Working out in water prevents falls and strain on joints.
- Tai chi combines slow, graceful movements with meditation. Benefits include better circulation and balance, lower blood pressure and increased relaxation.

28,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/5-great-senior-activities/,"Keeping busy can be a difficult task for aging adults. Our entire lives have been run by schedules, whether it be homework as a kid or real work as an adult. As aging adults enter the next chapter of their lives, they find themselves with more free time than they have experienced in a long time, and this leads to boredom, decreasing health, and lack of daily enjoyment. In order to make sure your parents are maintaining a fulfilled life, introduce some activities in their lives. Below we have listed 5 great activities that will not only help keep aging adults happy, but it can benefit their cognitive ability and overall health as well.
Jigsaw Puzzles
Jigsaw puzzles are a great activity for aging adults because they are fun, challenging, and help maintain their cognitive ability. Plus, they can be done over a long period of time making them ideal to come back to whenever they feel up to it. Building puzzles are great for family visits since they let everyone work together and allow for fun conversation. Furthermore, the feeling of putting in the final piece and completing the puzzle is a nice reward that gives a wonderful feeling of accomplishment.
Bingo
Bingo is a great activity for aging adults because it doesn’t require too much effort but the reward is huge. Whether they win or not, spending time with other individuals and getting out of the house does wonders for people’s moods. Bingo is a hotspot for friendly conversation and is a great way to meet new people with similar tastes…and there is nothing quite like yelling BINGO when you win!
Family Events
Throughout the year, there are plenty of family events that you will participate in, such as bowling, lunches, or any other activity that brings everyone together. Make sure your parents stay involved in these activities, especially when they begin to not want to leave their homes as much. These activities will help by keeping them active, getting them out of the house, and keeping them in touch with their loved ones. Even if they don’t think they can participate in events like bowling because they think its too physically demanding, suggest that they come and watch anyway. They will still receive all the benefits of conversing with loved ones and getting out of the house.
Sports/Movie Nights
If your parents are sports fans, invite them to watch the game at your house. Watching sports isn’t physically demanding and it gives them an opportunity to watch and discuss what they have always loved. Not sports fans? Show a movie at your house instead. End the night with some quality conversation about the game or movie and it will be a night you and your parents will both enjoy.
Sunday Drives
Sometimes the best thing you can do is drive your parents around on a leisure drive. This will get them out of the house and let them see the city around them without the physical demands of walking. Drive by old homes, schools, and favorite places for great memories and stimulating conversation. Better yet, offer to take them grocery shopping or any other errand runs. It will be a great help to them and will make these trips more enjoyable.
Bonus: Books
Make sure your parents have a selection of books on hand to read. Books are a great way to keep aging adults’ minds sharp and are easy to pick up and put down at their own leisure."
29,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/5-healthy-tips-to-avoid-weight-gain-during-the-holidays/,"The holidays are here and no one wants to be around a killjoy at a Christmas party or a family get-together because they’re trying to avoid the temptations of the season’s high-calorie bounty and dodge the gift of a few additional pounds this season.
Whether it’s one, three, or seven pounds, experience says that most of us will gain weight between now and New Year’s Day because of those darn frosted cookies, eggnog, chocolate, candies and more lurking around the office, at the neighbors, and in your own home. To make the most of the season and keep the holiday weight off, here are 5 key tips from our Nurse Gina to apply to your life to ensure you can enjoy a fun and healthy holiday season.
- Control temptation: Avoid arriving to the party hungry. Have a nutritious snack beforehand. If you do arrive hungry because you’re coming straight from a day of holiday shopping, drink some water to fill up before filling your plate.
- Limit your alcohol intake: Okay, we know the holidays are filled with parties and gatherings with people that may stress you out. Try to avoid drinking too much alcohol at these gatherings (even if your mother is hounding you about when you’re going to find a good man and settle down). If you consume a lot at these gatherings you will lose control over what you eat. If you feel out of place without a drink, try sipping on a glass of club soda and lime – so you have something in your hand like everyone else.
- Re-think what you bring to the party: Whether you’re going to a friend’s party or an office potluck, consider bringing a low-calorie treat that you know you, and others, will enjoy. You do not need to bring typical, high-calorie holiday fare. You can get away from rigid thinking about what holiday food has to be and bring a beautiful plate of fruit.
- Exercise: It’s that simple. Stay active and take 30 minutes out of your day every day during the holidays for exercise. On days you know you’ll be eating more than your typical day, give yourself another 10 to 15 minutes of exercise. Not only will this make you feel good, it will also help reduce holiday stress that so many people feel during this time of year.
- Stay hydrated: While rushing around shopping and preparing for guests, it’s easy to forget to drink plenty of water. Try to get in at least eight glasses a day. Your body easily confuses being hungry and being thirsty, so drinking water regularly will keep you from eating when what you really need is to drink.
We know that this time of year it’s nearly impossible to avoid parties bulging with buffets of tasty food and drink. But you can avoid the holiday weight gain trap by setting up a plan and sticking to it. For more tips, tricks, and motivational messages from Nurse Gina on how to avoid weight gain during this festive season, join us over on Facebook."
30,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/5-helpful-tips-first-time-caregivers/,"In November, we celebrate National Home Care and Family Caregivers Month, observances that are central to FirstLight Home Care. Throughout the month, our FirstLight weekly blog will focus on providing the tools, tips, resources and peace of mind that so many family caregivers need. If you are or have been a family caregiver, we invite you to comment and share your rewarding experiences caring for a loved one, as well as the struggles you have faced throughout your caregiving journey.
Providing care for an aging loved one can be rewarding. But it can also be quite difficult. If you’re a first-time caregiver, it can be even tougher, because not only is the role of family caregiver demanding and stressful, but it can cause hesitation, doubt and rattle your confidence if you’re not sure where to begin.
Sometimes you are thrust into a situation you’re not prepared for. If you’ve recently begun caring for a parent, grandparent or another family member, and the caregiving responsibilities are all new to you, the following tips may help as you prepare to take on your new role as a first-time caregiver.
1. Know what you are facing. Although you may immediately feel that it’s your sole responsibility to become the primary caregiver to your family member, there are several things to consider before you decide to take on the role.
As a first-time caregiver, you will need to keep track of a significant amount of information, and the daily schedule you once knew could dramatically change. Your loved one will need to get to and from doctor appointments. You will need to keep track of their medications and pick up prescriptions. And this is in addition to the other many aspects of caregiving, including grocery shopping, meal planning, laundry and more. Technology can be your ally. There are a number of caregiving apps that can help you maintain important information about your loved one, receive appointment and medication reminders, take notes and coordinate schedules if you have multiple family members and/or professional caregivers assisting with care.
Additionally, if you are not familiar with your loved one’s condition, learn as much as you can so that you can not only provide the best care now, but you also know what to expect as their condition progresses. This will help you make informed decisions about care options as your loved one ages.
2. Involve your loved one. Ask your loved one what they want. Make sure they are part of the conversation when it comes to important decisions, such as their finances, living situation and overall health. Most seniors struggle with the fact that they need help with the everyday tasks they used to do on their own. Having a caregiver can make them feel like they’ve lost their independence. When possible, encourage independence. Involve them in decisions about their care. If it’s safe, allow them to perform some of their daily tasks on their own so that they feel less dependent on you.
3. Seek outside support. Taking on the role of family caregiver can be unfamiliar territory. It can cause a significant amount of stress, exhaustion and sometimes even health issues. If you try to do everything yourself it could cause caregiver burnout. And if you burn out, your loved one’s care could suffer. There are a couple of ways to seek support:
- Create a system of family and friends who can assist with caregiving responsibilities, even if they help with minor tasks such as laundry, grocery shopping and meal preparation.
- Consider hiring a professional caregiver to come in for a few hours a week to assist with respite care for you and companion care or personal care needs for your senior.
- Find a community of caregivers. FirstLight’s resident nurse and Director of Client Care Services, Rebecca Rushing, gives this advice: Joining a caregiver support group allows you to be with those who really understand because they’ve been there too. Support groups encourage you to share common experiences and discuss some of the difficult and challenging situations you may be facing. One thing many caregivers tend to neglect is their own health and well-being. A support group can provide validation and encouragement that it’s OK to take care of yourself. Take a break every so often, seek respite and make sure you get enough rest. This will make you a better caregiver in the long run.
4. Be mindful of the potential costs of caregiving. Family caregivers give a lot of themselves, and they do not get paid. In fact, according to a recent AARP study, family caregivers spend an average of nearly $7,000 on out-of-pocket costs related to caregiving – almost 20 percent of their annual income. On average, caregivers spend a little more than 24 hours per week providing care to their loved one, and 25 percent of those caregivers devote 41 or more hours of care per week. If you also have a paying job, that job can suffer. Many family caregivers make work accommodations due to family caregiving responsibilities, including taking a leave of absence, arriving late, passing up a promotion or retiring early.
5. Take care of you. Would you recognize the warning signs of caregiver burnout? According to the Cleveland Clinic, caregiver burnout is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion that may be accompanied by a change in attitude. Burnout can occur when family caregivers don’t get the help they need, or if they try to take on more than they are able.
If you are a first-time caregiver, you may not experience burnout right away. But you should take immediate steps to try and prevent it altogether. Take care of you and you can take better care of your loved one. Get adequate sleep, eat well, take the time to do something you enjoy and socialize with friends – even if that means bringing in outside help to provide respite care.
If you are new to caregiving, you may be worried about many things and also feel overwhelmed by everything you are taking on. But with a little time, patience and help from others, you will be the best family caregiver to your loved one.
Are you a first-time caregiver? What advice would you give others who are new to this role?

31,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/5-helpful-tips-for-dementia-caregivers/,"16.1 million Americans provide unpaid care for people with Alzheimer’s or dementia, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. Caring for someone with dementia can be demanding and stressful if you’re not sure what to expect.
If you are caring for a loved one with dementia, the following 5 dementia caregiver tips can help with your day-to-day responsibilities and overall care.
#1. Encourage your loved one to eat right: People living with dementia should consume a healthy diet filled with fruits and vegetables. Proper nutrition is key to keeping their body strong and healthy. Remember that nutritious meals may become a challenge for people with dementia because as their cognitive function declines, they may become overwhelmed with too many food choices, have difficulty using utensils, or forget to eat altogether. And poor nutrition may increase behavioral symptoms as well as cause weight loss.
You – as the caregiver – should also eat right. Eating a healthy diet can go a long way toward warding off dementia, and it can also reduce the risk of developing additional health problems including heart disease, heart attack, stroke, cancer and diabetes. FirstLight Home Care’s Companion Care services can offer support by assisting with grocery shopping, meal preparation and more.
#2. Do things that make them laugh: Laughter is therapeutic. Research has shown that laughter is beneficial to those with memory loss. It can help reduce stress, blood pressure, and make your loved with dementia – and you – feel better.
#3. Create a serene, clutter-free home: Clutter around the home can be stressful. It’s important to create an environment where your loved one living with dementia can feel rested. Look around the home, reduce unwanted clutter and put things away. Also determine the key rooms your loved one uses most and consider painting them a subtle color. Avoid leaving the television on all day for background noise and instead play soothing music. Naturally scent the home with fresh flowers, a diffuser, or floral scented wax bars. Aromatherapy can bring a sense of calmness to the home.
#4. Encourage physical exercise: Research has proven that being active can slow down brain aging. Other studies have found that a sedentary lifestyle increases the probability that dementia will set in. When you exercise regularly, it stimulates blood circulation to the brain. Assisting the person you care for with a daily cardiovascular workout for at least 20 to 30 minutes a day can result in clarity and help bring their surroundings into greater focus.
#5. Take care of yourself: When caring for someone with dementia, you are bound to experience many sometimes difficult emotions: grief, anger, boredom, fatigue, fear, anxiety, frustration. It is important, as the caregiver, to stop and care for yourself. Caregiving is a demanding job, and if you’re caring for someone at the expense of taking care of yourself, it could lead to unintended consequences. Not paying attention to your personal happiness and fulfillment can create resentment over time as you continue to put others’ priorities ahead of your own. Ask other family members to help so that you can have some personal time. If they are unable to step in, hire FirstLight Home Care. Our Respite Care Services can make a difference in your life.

32,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/5-new-years-resolutions-for-being-a-great-caregiver/,"The beginning of a new year is a perfect time to evaluate our lives, address challenges and move forward with positivity. We’ve put together a collection of family caregiver New Year’s resolutions just for you.
Avoiding Caregiver Burnout and Importance of Caregiver Mental Health
Being a family caregiver for a family member is both a rewarding and challenging role. It can be overwhelming and place a strain on your most valued relationships.
Resolution 1: Grow your support circle.
Create a support team of family, friends and/or local resources, like FirstLight Home Care, to help you be the best family caregiver you can be by providing you with a family caregiver support program. Delegate specific tasks like providing companionship, managing finances, running errands or helping with household chores.
Resolution 2: Block out break times for yourself.
Even if you’re taking mini breaks throughout the day, do something simple and positive to help reduce the stress of being a family caregiver for a family member.
- Conduct a two-minute meditation.
- Take a minute or two to stretch and enjoy a quiet moment.
- Connect with family and friends with a phone call.
Resolution 3: Connect with the loved one in your care.
Find fun activities you can do together to make family caregiving feel like less of a chore and more of a time to grow your relationship. Doing a puzzle, going to the movies, playing a board game or taking a stroll will create a special time that you both can enjoy.
Resolution 4: Schedule time off weekly.
Family caregiver burnout is real. Find a family member, friend, volunteer or professional caregiver to help manage companion care and other personal care responsibilities for your loved one—even if just for a couple of hours a week—so you can take time for yourself.
Resolution 5: Don’t manage the symptoms, help improve them.
Work with your loved one to lower blood pressure, get control of glucose levels, eat right, stop smoking and get more exercise. Seniors who are physically healthy tend to be happier, more energetic and more positive overall.
Tips For Success In Being A Great Family Caregiver
Remember that everyone is an individual.
Many family caregivers for a family member don’t always relate to the person they’re caring for. Find out what motivates them as an individual and incorporate those things into your caregiving.
Include your loved one in tasks.
Another way to help a loved one feel less overwhelmed and anxious is by including them in everyday tasks. For example, if your loved one resists leaving the house, consider going on a shopping trip where they help look for items on the list—like a scavenger hunt. Involvement may be an effective way to distract your loved one from fear or anxiety.
Do things in steps.
Breaking tasks into multiple steps can be a good way to make them less overwhelming and easier to accomplish.
Listen to their stories.
No matter how many times you’ve heard them, listen as if it were the first time. Listening creates trust. And really hearing what your loved one is telling you can help you better understand what’s meaningful for them.
Don’t take it personally.
One of the most difficult things for many family caregivers is dealing with the emotions they feel about their loved one’s condition or behavior. It’s not unusual for age or sickness to cause dramatic shifts in memory and even mood, and this can be hard on the caregiver.
FirstLight Home Care – Your Caregiving Resource.
Being a family caregiver for a family member can be a beautiful and rewarding experience. Know that you are making a profound difference in your loved one’s life, that there are resources out there to help you and most importantly, that you’re not alone.

33,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/5-reasons-to-thank-a-nurse-national-nurses-week-is-may-6-12/,"Nursing is a noble profession that is not for the faint of heart. Nurses face risks and challenges in their job each day, and their courage and patients should be celebrated.
In 1993, the American Nurses Association declared May 6-12 as the national week to honor and elevate the nursing profession. National Nurses Week is a time for everyone to recognize the positive impact and vast contributions millions of nurses make to our communities. Each year, the celebration ends on May 12, Florence Nightingale’s birthday.
At FirstLight Home Care, we have dozens of reasons to thank a nurse for their hard work and dedication. Here are five of our favorites:
- Nurses are brave. They are on the front lines every day. Nurses are the unsung heroes who take care of us without the expectation of reward. They stay calm in emergencies and they serve those who are ill with compassion, imagination, tenacity, care, and even a little humor.
- They listen and answer questions. Part of the nursing assessment is to understand the patient’s situation and how it impacts their health. Nurses actively listen to ensure they deliver quality care specific to the individual. Their medical knowledge is boundless and they’re ready to answer a patient’s questions in order to help with their recovery.
- They are patient advocates. Nurses help patients make informed decisions regarding their health, including helping them navigate a complex medical system, translating medical terms and helping to make ethical decisions. The American Nurses Association (ANA) provides this definition of nursing practice: “The protection, promotion, and optimization of health and abilities, prevention of illness and injury, alleviation of suffering through the diagnosis and treatment of human response, and advocacy in the care of individuals, families, communities, and populations.”
- They support patients’ families. When a family member becomes ill, it impacts the entire family. Nurses understand this and provide family-centered care. They form relationships and provide communication and collaboration in order to address the emotional, physical, and psychological affect family members have on the patient and his or her outcome.
- They work long shifts. Traditional 8-hour shifts for nurses is a thing of the past. Nurses typically work 12-hours shifts, and these longer shifts can be emotionally and physically draining. They’re often on their feet the entire time, and according to one study from Nurses.org, the average nurse walks over three miles in one shift. They do all this while keeping patient care front and center.
It is indisputable. Nurses are amazing! They work hard to provide the best care for people when they need it the most. It is important to thank and recognize nurses during National Nurses Week, but we should acknowledge their dedication and service to our health and wellbeing every day.
FirstLight Home Care is proud to know and work alongside some incredible nurses. If you know an amazing nurse, share your story in a comment below, or join the conversation on our Facebook page.

34,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/5-reasons-we-love-america/,"The 4th of July may have come and gone this year, but the memory lingers on. We should celebrate all that is good about America each and every day, not just reserve our patriotism for one day of the year! We think this is a brilliant idea that needs little motivation. But, in case you do, here are 5 reasons why we love America:
- Freedom: We have the freedom to do what we want, believe in what we want, and say what we want and to do so without persecution. For many in the world, this is not true. In America…we can.
- Diversity: We are a melting pot. Every nation, race and color is represented in America. The diversity of every man, woman, and child is what makes our country strong.
- Opportunity: This is the land of opportunity. If you work hard enough, and persevere through failures and setbacks, you can still achieve success in the United States. The spirit of America lives and we see it every day with hard-working people, small businesses, entrepreneurs with a vision and determination, and the dreamers who are out there wanting a better life.
- Volunteerism: People in the United States love to help. Whether it’s around the globe or next door when people are in need, the people of American help. We see this all the time with our senior care. We have seen friends and family members and virtual strangers lend a hand after a horrific storm or deliver hot meals to home-bound seniors. We have seen the resiliency of Americans numerous times after 9/11 as everyone pitches in and helps. When there is a need, Americans rise to lend a helping hand (and ask for nothing in return). We should be very proud of our fellow Americans.
- Beauty: Have you looked outside lately? Have you driven across our wide-open country? It’s beautiful. Each region of our country has special beauty that if you pull over and look out, you’ll be pretty impressed with our mountains, lakes, beaches, rivers, the open plains, and everything else. Even the large city landscapes and open parks are something to love.
So let’s proudly display the American flag today and every day!

35,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/5-senior-friendly-remodels-that-wont-break-the-bank/,"Living well during your golden years is something of a double-edge sword. You now have the time to fill your days pursuing hobbies and interests that were put on hold due to other life demands. The other side of the coin – the possibility of failing health or a fall – needs to be addressed before disruptions push your new found pursuits aside for good. Moving to a care facility or a smaller, accessibility friendly home isn’t much of a choice. In economically challenging times, there’s a reason why remodeling your home, including additions like stair lifts and walk-In showers/tub combinations, have become so popular as well as affordable for so many. But just what senior-friendly additions or remodels would be best to make in your home?
When considering an accessibility driven addition or remodel, the focus should be on universal design. This concept involves incorporating design that addresses self-sufficiency, safety, mobility, comfort and convenience into your current home design. Such as a stair lift for a two-level home. Of course, the best time to rethink about home modifications and remodels is long before the need for them actually occurs.
Here are few remodels to consider when making your current home senior-friendly.
- Consider a stair lift. Installing a stair lift is an economical and adaptable way to increase mobility in your home without the expense of moving or a major renovation. When climbing stairs becomes a safety issue, a stair lift can extend your years of independence without the worry of how to get around or falling. A key benefit here is no major remodeling is needed. Most stair lifts can be installed in one day. The best part is stair lifts can be installed on curved, straight and even spiral stairs.
- Install handrails. Besides stair lifts, handrails can help with mobility. Falls can be avoided if there is something to hang on to when maneuvering within long hallways.
- Install outdoor stair lifts or chair lifts outside. Chair lifts or stair lifts are the new answer to building outdoor ramps. Of course, creating wider pathways and clearing shrubbery will also help with both safety and security. But there are many outdoor models for stairway chair lifts to choose from, and units are designed to be protected from various weather conditions.
- Install motion sensor lights or motion detecting lights. This is an excellent idea since it addresses safety, mobility and convenience at the same time. Installed outside the front door, back door, garage door and driveway, these lights can reduce falls from fumbling to finding keys in the dark. An entryway can be notoriously dark and dangerous if it’s not well lit. If motion sensor lights are installed inside of dark stairwells, it makes mobility easier, especially when carrying items like heavy groceries. No one needs to worry about slipping, falling and bumping into furniture.
- Invest in a Better Bath. A bathroom remodel is an senior-friendly modification that is also a wise investment. Shower bars are not the only way to make baths and showers safer from falls and slips. A smaller investment may be to place non-slip flooring or bathmats in the shower. People looking to remodel can find a wide array of convenient shower tub installs. From walk-in showers and tubs to single-handled faucets that make gripping a cinch, to seating areas in shower stalls, home remodelers can find what you need to make your home easily accessible.
Home assessments are available from many contractors. Once you’ve got that assessment list, you can begin the task of obtaining work estimates. Many of these renovations are budget-friendly and take no time at all. With accessible chair and stair lifts, senior home modifications can give you security, safety and convenience without the loss of independence.

Yes, much easier said than done, but blood pressure seems to go up as weight goes up. This means you must begin a healthy diet. This diet should be low in sodium and low in caffeine. If this is something new to you and your family, reach out to a professional that can help you with a meal plan. Your physician should be able to lead you in the right direction as far as dieticians in the area. It is important to lose the weight now, which leads me to the next step.
- Exercise
Begin an exercise program. Do not start off too big, thus burning out too fast. Keep your exercise program realistic and maintainable. The more you exercise your heart, the better your body will feel and blood pressure will go down.
- Tobacco and alcohol
Stay away from tobacco products and reduce your alcohol intake. Nicotine is known to increase blood pressure by 10 mm hg one hour after you smoke (mayoclinic.com). Therefore, if you smoke all day, your blood pressure will continue to rise. Small amounts of alcohol can actually lower blood pressure, but if you drink too much, this protective barrier goes away. Simply drink in moderation.
- Monitor
Continue to monitor your blood pressure. This can be done both at home and by your healthcare provider. Make sure to keep up with appointments and any medications regarding your high blood pressure.
- Communicate
It is important to be open to support from family and friends. First of all, it is important to relieve as much stress as possibly, and if your loved ones are
well aware of this, maintaining a happy lifestyle, in order to reduce stress, thus reduce blood pressure, will fall into place. They can also help with your meal plans, medication reminders, doctor’s visit, etc. They are so important for moral and to motivate you to lead a healthy lifestyle so you can be around for years to come."
37,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/5-surprising-ways-stress-can-impact-senior-health/,"Everyone experiences stress to some degree. Yet, it can be a silent factor of overall well-being, especially for seniors. Often, senior stress can mask itself in a number of ways, and cause serious issues that may be attributed to other senior health issues. Therefore, it’s important for seniors and their caregivers to understand the symptoms of stress, as well as the different ways to address and prevent it.
Overeating
When people get stressed, their body releases cortisol, a hormone that readies the body for a fight or flight response. This is why appetite increases during stressful situations: the body is trying to get as much energy as possible to defend itself. However, this is often presented as an increased craving for high fat and/or sugary foods. This can be especially detrimental to seniors who are at a higher risk of developing high cholesterol and blood sugar through poor diet. Family caregivers should be on the lookout for changes in their loved one’s normal eating habits, such as opting for unhealthy options or continuously snacking despite feeling full, which can be a sign that a senior is dealing with high stress.
Poor Sleep
A lack of sleep is also an indicator of senior stress. With a mind busy worrying, the body stays on high alert, which can ultimately affect the ability to fall asleep. This can be especially harmful to seniors whose bones and muscles need overnight recovery to fight weakness. And, while most people understand the importance of proper rest and the significant role it can have in treating the symptoms of stress, few know that a good night’s sleep can also help the body prevent future stress. There are many suggestions for what a good night’s sleep is, but a safe goal for seniors to aim for is seven hours a night in order to minimize stress and prevent future anxiety.
High Blood Pressure
Like stress eating, high blood pressure (HBP) isn’t a visible symptom of stress, but it is a serious senior health issue that is often caused by high stress levels. If left unchecked, it can lead to other problems in older adults like fatigue, erectile dysfunction, and even coronary artery disease. These are issues that seniors are already at high-risk for, so it’s critical that they, and their caregivers, keep an eye out for symptoms. Additionally, because HBP is most often detected by a doctor, seniors should regularly visit their physician, especially if they’re at high risk for stress. Not only will this keep them on track to be healthy year-round, but it will also minimize the risks of unseen health concerns popping up.
Mood Swings
Minimal mood fluctuations are perfectly normal and even healthy in older adults. But, when seniors begin to experience sharp swings between extremes, there may be a more serious cause. Stress can cause irritability, social withdrawal and abnormal mood in adults, symptoms that can become hazards to mental health in a senior population that already typically gets minimal social interaction. If any mood seems unfamiliar or unexplainably drastic, seniors should consider telling their doctors in order to find the most effective ways to treat the stress that causes it.
Tips to Reduce Stress
While stress can be difficult to identify, it’s always a good idea to actively prevent it, and practice effective treatments to reduce it. A few easy ways seniors can protect themselves from falling victim to stress-related issues every day include:
- Getting regular exercise
- Meditating and engaging in other mindful activities
- Volunteering in the community
- Eating healthy meals
- Getting enough high-quality sleep
- Engaging in creative endeavors like gardening, cooking, painting.
Staying stress-free is a crucial aspect of senior well-being. It helps maintain physical, mental and emotional health, and should always be at the forefront of a senior and caregiver’s mind. Follow these tips and adapt them to individual needs in order to help your loved one stay healthy.

38,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/5-things-to-consider-before-becoming-your-parents-caregiver/,"Each year, more than 43 million Americans provide unpaid care to a family member, usually a parent. Most seniors prefer to age in place, but as they grow older and face declining health, they may need extra care at home. In many cases, their children decide to step in and become the caregiver.
Serving as a caregiver for a family member is one of the most rewarding jobs you can do. It allows you to spend time with your loved one, and it provides you with the opportunity to ensure they receive the best quality care possible. Every day, adult children are considering taking on the primary role of their parent’s caregiver, advocate, provider coordinator, and manager of all home care tasks. If you are in this situation, here are 5 things to consider before taking on this role.
- Your capabilities: Are you capable of taking care of your aging loved one all by yourself? If you can, that is great. But if you are juggling their care in conjunction with a full-time job and your own family responsibilities, hiring outside help to manage day-to-day activities and requirements, may be necessary.
- Understanding your parent’s medical conditions and needs: Are you prepared to take care of your parent’s medical conditions as they progress with age? Becoming the family caregiver means you become their biggest advocate. It is critical to understand their current conditions and possible progressions. Knowing what to expect can help you make better decisions regarding your parent’s care, your level of involvement, and when you’ll need to seek professional support. Caring for someone with Alzheimer’s or dementia, for examples, can be difficult to do alone.
- Your support system: Do you have family members nearby to help you? As a caregiver, it is very common to ignore your own needs as your parent’s care increases, and this can cause burnout. Caregivers need time to themselves to recharge. Not paying attention to your personal happiness and fulfillment can create resentment over time as you continue to put others’ priorities ahead of your own. If family members cannot step up to give respite care to you, getting outside support needs to be considered.
- Get things in order: As the family caregiver, are you prepared to have the tough conversations with your folks? To give your parents the best care, it is important to have open discussions about their finances, health, care expectations, advanced directives and everything in between. Understanding the big picture of your parents’ resources, needs and wishes will streamline your caregiving responsibilities.
- Role reversal: Are you ready to be your parent’s parent? As your parents become older, your role will change as you become the family caregiver. You may have to take over finances, take away driving privileges, make sure they’re eating, bathing or taking their medications. It is somewhat of a role reversal as you become your parent’s parent – the disciplinarian, enforcing what’s best for them and doing so without anger or having your feelings hurt.
Also, consider your age and how soon you decide to take on the primary caregiving role. More and more 20- and 30-somethings are becoming family caregivers. A new report finds that many millennials are now filling that role, especially to loved ones who have Alzheimer’s.

39,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/5-things-you-can-do-today-to-live-healthier/,"Research shows that the key to lifelong good health is more than just eating right. It also includes how you think, exercise, sleep, and engage with others. We asked “Just Ask FirstLight” about their thoughts on a number of life issues, here’s what they had to say:
- Think Positive. Your body believes what you think, so focus on the positive. When you think positive it will help you to build a healthier immune system and boost your overall health.
- Exercise. Daily physical exercise can help you reduce stress, improve your blood pressure, lower your cholesterol, and help you look and feel better (see point #1). Before you start any new workout program, check with your doctor to make sure it is the right program for you.
- Eat Your Veggies. Your goal should be to get five servings of vegetables a day – raw, steamed or stir-fried. They are a great source of vitamins, they are low in calories, and they have amazing digestive benefits.
- Sleep. Get a good night’s sleep every day. Sleep will help you recharge. If you have trouble sleeping you should find relaxation techniques, such as meditation, that will help you reduce stress and support rest. Turn off all your electronic devices one hour before you go to bed. This will help you disconnect and lessen your anxiety prior to sleep.
- Hang With Healthy People. Do a quick inventory of the friends and family members you engage with each week. These personal relationships will influence your health so it is very important that you surround yourself with people who are positive, happy, and focused on living a content life.

40,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/5-things-your-mom-didnt-tell-you-about-growing-old/,"Our moms taught us many things when we were growing up – how to braid our hair, tie our shoes, dance, and multi-task both at home and work. However, it’s amusing that she failed to tell us what would happen as we age. It’s like we’re now the Lewis and Clark of old age…uncovering and discovering all these new and unknown changes we’re going through. It would have been nice if she would have just handed us her old-age map with instructions on what to expect.
So if your mom is anything like our mom, then you’ll want to read this blog post and avoid having to figure it out on your own.
Your hair changes color and gets thinner: Okay, we all know our hair will change from its current color to gray. This we figured out on our own just by watching our own mother’s hair. Our hair is turning gray and that is why we have a great hairstylist…to keep this change from happening. But what our moms failed to tell us is that your hair will travel to other places or leave entirely. If you went to your mirror right now you’d be shocked at the hairs now permanently located on your chin. Then, look at your eyebrows…they’re gone. We don’t see how these two areas on our faces are connected. But they are.
Hormones…or lack thereof: Most likely you received the “talk” from your mom. For some of you that could have been a few years ago…but for many in our social group that was 25 to 35 years ago. We’ve had no such talk since that faithful day. It was great to know how our hormones are ramping up when we’re 12 to 15 years old but dropping off or just completely shutting down after 50 is nothing she thought necessary to tell us. Oh, and she forgot to mention the wicked hot flashes.
Flat feet: Back in the day, we’d wear high-heel shoes and boots. Our feet and more importantly our ankles looked fabulous. After 50 it’s a bit more challenging to walk on any heels over an inch (great). The older you get the flatter your feet become and the next thing you know, you can only wear flats and well, love it.
You’d Be Happy: Whenever you talk to someone about growing old it seems to be somewhat negative – gray hair, you look tired, you shrink, nothing fits, boobs sag, hearing fails, you need reading glasses and so on and so on. But what mom didn’t tell us is that even if all things change, and sometimes not for the better, the sense of happiness that comes with aging is something to get excited about. There is a level of peace that comes with growing older and growing into your own skin. Gone is the angst we felt in our teens when we were constantly being judged by our peers.
Losing Weight. Who thought it would be so hard in your 50s to lose weight? Because your metabolism slows down, it takes twice as much exercise to work off half the calories!
Old age is something you can either embrace, or try and erase. We’re going with embrace … how about you?"
41,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/5-tips-finding-hobby-fill-fall-gap-older-adults/,"Chances are, you think more about hobbies at the beginning of the year – when resolving to try something new – than you do as autumn approaches. But for older adults, this time of year can represent a big gap: Summer has ended and the holidays are still in the distance. Activities and visits from family can wane as fall begins, making it an ideal time to introduce or renew focus on a cherished hobby.
Explore the Possibilities
The calendar of national observances for September supports the fall hobby concept. For animal lovers, there’s Dog Ownership Month or Happy Cat Month. Foodies have Ethnic Foods Month. Music lovers can choose from Piano Month or Classical Music Month. For readers, Library Card Sign Up Month. Fashionistas can celebrate Fall Hat Month. And it doesn’t stop there. With so many observances as fall gets underway, you’re likely to find local activities that will allow for exploring a variety of hobby possibilities.
Get Started with These Tips
How can you find an activity that’s not only the right fit for the older adult in your life, but that also provides health benefits? Here are FirstLight’s five tips for finding the right hobby to fill the fall gap.
- Go with what you know (and love). The simplest activity to incorporate into an older adult’s life may be the one they’re already familiar with or have dreamt about doing. Consider renewing a focus on an activity that may have been loved during years gone by, but was forced out of the schedule when days were filled with working or raising children. Or dust off that bucket list and do something that’s always been a personal aspiration.
- Be adaptable. The physical or cognitive limitations that often come with aging don’t have to prevent older adults from enjoying activities they love. Many hobbies can be adapted to changing abilities. For example, a person who used to spend hours in the garden could create a potted version on a deck or porch. A former runner could take up nature walking. Being adaptable can lead to new ways to enjoy old interests.
- Get social. Hobbies that involve social interaction can provide compelling health benefits. According to the University of Rochester Medical Center, people who continue to interact socially live longer than their isolated counterparts. In fact, social interactions are shown to improve mental health, as well as protect against certain illnesses by boosting the immune system.
- Move it. There’s a mountain of medical evidence that physical activity is integral to good health. According to the National Institutes of Health, even moderate physical activity can help older adults prevent or delay disease, manage stress and improve mood. To maximize the health benefits, consider hobbies that incorporate physical activity. Popular, low-impact options for older adults include walking, swimming and Tai Chi.
- Use your head. According to the World Health Organization, common factors such as isolation, loss of independence and loneliness can take a significant toll on the mental health of older adults. And declining mental health can affect mood, energy, sleep, appetite and physical health. Hobbies that stimulate the mind – reading, music, puzzles, games and more – can help boost mental health. And they may also contribute to preserved mental function.

42,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/5-tips-for-helping-the-elderly-with-personal-hygiene/,"Everyday tasks can become more difficult as we age. For many seniors, good personal hygiene can be especially challenging due to a lack of mobility and sometimes a sheer lack of energy. Depression, isolation, dementia, a fear of falling, or medication side effects can all cause seniors to lose interest in or completely neglect their personal hygiene and grooming.
Health and hygiene go hand in hand. If you or an aging loved one is having difficulties maintaining a daily hygiene routine, here are some helpful tips.
- Identify the issues. Get to the root of why your loved one has neglected their personal hygiene. Aging adults often develop poor hygiene because of mobility issues or because they are physically unable to perform their normal hygiene routines and are afraid to say something. Whatever the reason, it is important to identify the issues and discuss potential solutions to help them stay clean and healthy.
- Establish a routine. Creating a daily hygiene routine can help your loved one get used to doing specific activities such as showering, brushing their hair and teeth. Avoid making these daily hygiene routines seem like chores or something which must be rushed. Make it part of their day:
- Put on the music they like
- Keep the room, the water, and the towels warm
- Layout their clothes so they can slip into a comfortable outfit right away
- Ensure the bathroom is safe. The fear of falling or slipping can often be enough to prevent seniors from using a shower or bath altogether. Install the right equipment in the bathroom – such as handrails in the shower and near the toilet, install raised toilet seats, and add a bench in the shower.
- Buy helpful hygiene aids. There are many devices that are designed to solve elderly hygiene issues by making it easier for them to take care of their own personal grooming. Shower chairs, no-rinse bathing wipes, and long-handled shower brushes, razors, and toenail clippers can all make taking care of personal hygiene safer and easier.
- Consider hiring professional support. A professional caregiver can provide personal hygiene services for you. Your loved one may prefer this option if he or she has been avoiding having to ask you or another family member for help. They may actually feel more comfortable having a non-family member perform these tasks. FirstLight Home Care’s Personal Care Services help with many activities of daily living, from bathing and oral hygiene to walking and mobility…and everything in between.
Assisting aging loved ones with their personal hygiene is a labor of love, but it can also be tiring and stressful. FirstLight Home Care and our highly trained caregivers are here to provide the home care support you and your loved one need to feel safe, comforted, and cared for.
We are proud to CHAMPION the family caregiver, offering empathy, advice, and support for those who provide countless hours of care to their loved ones. At FirstLight Home Care we want to provide a helping hand, relieve some of the stress that comes with caregiving and give you back a few hours in your overwhelmingly busy day."
43,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/5-tips-for-making-an-arthritics-life-easier/,"My mother was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis when she was 20, but was able to stay mobile well into her 80s. During the course of those 60 years, I watched her take various medications, try different diets and exercise programs, and attempt various other remedies to combat her pain and fatigue. Okay, the psychic healer was the most far-fetched, but we would have tried anything to keep Mom “upright” as she used to say.
Now I am in my 50s and have been diagnosed with the same illness. I know the struggles that lay before me. Some days it would be easy to curl up and be a couch potato, but I know one of the keys is to keep moving!
Here are 5 tips that make my life as an arthritic easier:
- Pick an activity you like to do and keep doing it. My Mom liked to swim at the community pool because the water was warm and soothed her aching joints. Personally, I like walking on my treadmill or doing yoga. Don’t make the exercise too strenuous … kick boxing might be out! Try low-impact aerobic activity or range of motion exercises to maintain your flexibility. The truth is if you don’t use your muscles, they can begin to atrophy… move it or lose it!
- Have you ever struggled to open a can or jar? Don’t! OXO Good Grips kitchen tools were designed by an entrepreneurial husband whose wife had arthritis and can make cooking a lot easier. Need to chop some garlic? Either invest in a good food processor or cheat like I do – buy them pre-chopped!
- Make items easy to reach. At 5’2”, I try and store things so I don’t always have to reach or bend, particularly in my laundry room or bathroom. It must have been a giant who designed those cabinets on top of your oven! When I am shopping at the grocery store and want to buy something I can’t reach, I always find someone who is tall… they are often flattered they can use their height to their advantage.
- Pace yourself. Since I work full-time and have two active teenagers, this one is the hardest for me. However, if I overdo it, I pay for it the next day. I try and make lists to coordinate my errands and stop running around by 9PM at night. This gives me an hour to relax before bedtime and helps me to sleep.
- Get a massage. Some of my arthritic friends go to chiropractors – I get a deep tissue massage once/month. It’s definitely not relaxing, but kneading those sore muscles or stress points really works the kinks out.
Have I had to adjust my lifestyle to accommodate my arthritis? You bet! But since both longevity and arthritis run in our family, and this is the only body I have, I better take care of it!"
44,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/5-tips-to-manage-holiday-stress/,"With all the decorating, cooking and gatherings, Hanukkah, Christmas and the New Year tend to bring additional stress. But a little planning and prioritizing can help you enjoy a peaceful holiday season. Here are some useful tips for all of us to help manage holiday stress:
- Remind yourself that things don’t always go as planned… and be flexible. It’s ok if you can’t make it to every holiday party you are invited to or stay for hours at each one. If you need to make an appearance at more than one, just be cautious of the time and leave when you need to. Set boundaries. Set an alarm on your watch or cell phone giving yourself a few minutes to say your goodbyes before heading on to the next. If you have elderly loved ones with you, keep in mind their needs and plan ahead. Feel good about asking for help if you need it.
- Spending time as a family is the ultimate gift to each other whether you are eating together, exchanging gifts, singing carols or sharing memories of Christmases, Hanukkahs or New Years past. There is much joy in the company of family and a room full of laughter and storytelling. If you’re hosting a family gathering, ask family members ahead of time to help decorate and set up or bring a dish with them to alleviate the stress of cooking and preparing all on your own. The time together and memories made are what’s most important.
- Be creative with your travel schedule. If you can’t be with family during the holiday season, it is ok – be creative and set your own holiday schedule. Traveling during the peak times of the holidays can be stressful with traffic jams, packed airports and hustle and bustle. Look into the alternative of traveling before or after the holidays.
- Adjust your gift-giving budget. If it feels like your wallet isn’t big enough for the number of gifts you would like to purchase, consider downsizing your gift-giving traditions this year. Keep it simple by drawing names with each family member – buy a gift for one person and set a limit. You’ll have more money to spend on a gift for one person than if you had to spread your budget amongst many.
- Donate to those in need. Experience joy in giving to those who are in need by donating to a charitable organization or directly to a child or family in need. Or consider volunteering at a food pantry, soup kitchen or homeless shelter. You’ll quickly gain perspective, better appreciate your blessings, and you will get a far greater gift in return knowing you have made a difference by helping those who are perhaps less fortunate than yourself.
If you’re a family caregiver, there are ways to also cope with the holiday blues so that you can enjoy everything the holiday season brings. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed during the holidays, take a break to manage holiday stress. Find a quiet place alone to yourself, reflect, and stay focused on what is important.

45,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/5-ways-to-ease-the-stress-of-back-to-school/,"Back-to-school time can be stressful and hectic for kids, and let’s be honest…for parents too. As families prepare to head back to school, parents may be feeling overwhelmed by the pressure that comes from managing their family’s needs in addition to their daily work and household responsibilities.
Here are five ways to ease the stress of back to school for parents and help the entire family make a healthy transition from the lazy days of summer to the structure of the school year.
1. Establish routines: Before summer comes to an end, start establishing everyone’s school-day routines to avoid shocking the system when that first day arrives. Establish a bedtime and morning wakeup times, set a regular meal schedule, and develop a daily structure with homework, sports, other school activities, and downtime. Getting everyone acclimated to the new routine well before the first bell rings will make the transition back to the school year easier.
2. Divide and conquer: Get everyone in the family involved around the house. Share in the daily responsibilities by setting a schedule of tasks that each person in the family is responsible for, as well as when they need to be completed. You could even plan out meals for the week and on the weekends and get the entire family involved in preparing them.
In a perfect world, everyone in the family would chip in and help, but we all know that sometimes we simply run out of daylight. As hard-working parents juggling many responsibilities, sometimes you just need a little extra assistance with the day-to-day, and that is where we can help. We provide family home care services that are customized for your specific busy family’s needs, including:
- Running errands, such as picking up dry cleaning and prescriptions
- Help with laundry and light housekeeping
- Grocery shopping, meal planning and meal preparation
- Transportation to and from doctors’ appointments (for adults 18 and older)
- Organizing mail and paperwork
- Cleaning out and organizing closets
- And so much more!
3. Stay connected: As a family, make sure to set a specific time each week where you can all hang out together and enjoy dinner, watch a movie or go for a walk. Designate times that are activity-free (and tech-free) so that you and your kids can relax and take a breather. For the kids, make plans to get together with other children who are in their class so that they can build friendships and have someone to sit next to at lunch. For the parents, schedule time to hang out with friends, have a date night or just enjoy a moment of quiet me-time.
4. Get organized: Lifestyle expert and mom of seven, Jenny Reimold, has some great organization tips. Before the kids go to bed on a school night, have them pack their lunches and backpacks while you’re getting your lunch and workbag together too so that everyone can avoid forgetting things during the morning rush.
On Sunday, have everyone in the family start planning out what they’re going to wear for the week. Organize outfits in their closets by day to “give them, and you, a sense of control and helps ease the pain of a stressful morning routine of trying to figure out what to wear.”
5. Watch and listen: Once the school year is underway, schedule time each day to check in with your child, and with yourself, to make sure no one is feeling stressed, anxious or overwhelmed. Not all children, or adults, express stress in the same way. Make it a point to be available to actively listen to any of your child’s concerns and be sure to offer a helping hand when the time is right. Talk to your family doctor if the stress levels or issues are more than you or your child can handle.
Back to school doesn’t have to mean back to the crazy life. By establishing a routine to your family’s work and school week, you can ensure that everyone has a successful school year.

46,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/5-winter-driving-safety-tips-for-seniors/,"For many people, winter is full of family, friends and food. However, winter weather may make it more complicated to get out of the house, especially when you’re the one driving. Snow, ice, sleet and cold temperatures create new challenges for senior drivers. Seniors who rely on their own vehicle for transportation should be aware that driving in winter weather requires additional safety measures and extra care. Because driving abilities change with age, senior drivers should be prepared to take some extra precautions to help them to drive safely in harsh weather conditions.
1. Winterize your vehicle
Give your vehicle a little extra care during the winter months. Make sure that your brakes, headlights and windshield wipers are working properly. Also, check on the antifreeze levels, oil levels and tires. It is important, especially for seniors, that the heater and defroster are fully functioning as seniors are more susceptible to the frigid winter temperatures.
2. Always have a full tank of gas
There is nothing worse than running out of gas when it’s freezing and snowing outside. Keep your gas tank full during the winter months to avoid harmful condensation forming inside your gas tank and freezing in the fuel line. It may be pricey to keep your tank full, but it is less expensive than towing and repairs to frozen fuel lines.
3. Avoid rush hour and back roads
During heavy traffic periods, there are more people on the road and higher chances for traffic accidents. If you must go out during rush hour, be aware of black ice and traffic jams. If the roads are bad, avoid using back roads and shortcuts. Because there are fewer cars on the road, they are less likely to be plowed or salted and may be more dangerous than well-traveled roads.
4. Travel with a companion
Travel companions can be great during the winter months. Not only do they keep you awake and aware, but they can also help you to navigate the slippery roads and get through heavy traffic. If you don’t have someone to travel with in bad winter weather, make sure that someone knows where you’re going and that you have a cell phone with you in case of an emergency.
5. Prepare for an emergency
If you’re traveling during the winter months, especially for an extended period of time, it is helpful to be over-prepared. Put together an emergency kit to store in the trunk of your car, including (but not limited to):
- A blanket
- Food and water
- A flashlight with extra batteries
- A first-aid kit
- Jumper cables
- An ice scraper
- Sand, salt or non-clumping kitty litter to provide extra tire traction
- Extra clothing, boots and gloves
This winter, take your time driving when the roads are snowy and slick. If you don’t feel comfortable driving in the winter weather don’t hesitate to ask for help. Winter weather can be challenging for senior drivers, but if you plan accordingly and are aware of the dangerous conditions, you can arrive safely at your destination."
47,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/50-ways-home-care-supports-family-caregivers/,"For so many family caregivers, the story is familiar. “I don’t know where to turn for help.” Or, “I’m exhausted. I don’t think I can do this on my own anymore.” Or, “There has to be a better way to care for my loved one.”
These are the words of an untold number of family caregivers who are struggling to provide care and support for loved ones, while at the same time maintaining some balance in their own lives. The good news is there is somewhere to turn for help. You don’t have to do it alone. There’s a way to ensure the independence and safety of your loved ones while still having time for a job, a home, the rest of your family – and yourself.
Home care is an answer many family caregivers are pleasantly surprised to discover. And when they find out the depth of the home care resource, they often say, “I didn’t know home care could do all of that!”
As we continue to observe National Family Caregivers Awareness Month, here are 50 surprising ways non-medical home care can be there for you and your loved ones.
- Accompaniment to doctor’s visits and other appointments
- Advice and support for family caregivers
- Assistance with air travel including airport check-in, ticketing, security/customs and luggage management
- Assistance with ground transportation for vacations and trips

48,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/6-ideas-for-celebrating-mothers-day/,"Last year’s Mother’s Day was certainly untraditional. This year, with more of us receiving COVID-19 vaccinations, there’s more freedom to spend time together.
It’s great news considering the importance of this special day. If you haven’t been able to spend much time with your mother – or another relative that’s like a mom to you – due to the pandemic, you want to make this year even more memorable.
While everyone still needs to be careful, especially if a family member is vulnerable, there are many ways to celebrate. Here are six ideas for making Mother’s Day in 2021 a day to remember:
#1: Focus on Her Favorites ?
What are your mother’s favorite flowers, chocolates, perfume or other items? Fill a basket with them and bring them to her home. You can also cook a homemade meal or pick up something from her favorite restaurant. Invite her to join you at home or bring it to her if she’s unable to leave hers.
#2: Go on a Mother’s Day Adventure ?
If your mom can easily get around, go somewhere together. It can be as simple as taking a walk at the park or going out to eat at a restaurant she enjoys. Other ideas include visiting a botanical garden or a butterfly conservatory or shopping at a local antique store and having lunch afterward.
This will get your mom up and active and doing something she enjoys. Even better, you’ll have time to spend together, laugh and make new memories. The change of scenery will also be welcome after a year of shutdowns.
#3: Schedule a Spa Day ?
If your mother enjoys being pampered, schedule a day at the spa for her to celebrate Mother’s Day. There are some spas that even offer services tailored around seniors. You can enjoy a massage or a manicure or pedicure. Afterward, take her out for brunch, lunch or coffee and dessert.
If a spa day is out of your budget, consider pampering her at home with a manicure or pedicure or by styling her hair. She’ll enjoy the time you’re taking to spend with her and feel relaxed in the comfort of her own home.
#4: Get Creative ?
For a Mother’s Day gift from the heart, write your mom a poem or put a photo album together of special memories. You can also gather her children and grandchildren and create a video for her with each person sharing a memory or saying what they love most about her.
Another idea is to ask each family member to create a piece of artwork or write a special note and place it in an album for her to look through and enjoy. These are gifts that will not only brighten her Mother’s Day this year, but items she can keep and look through any time.
#5: Spend Quality Time Together ?
While there are many ideas to celebrate Mother’s Day, what really matters is spending time together. Even if she isn’t able to leave her home or the community she lives in, don’t be discouraged. Bring the celebration to her. If she enjoys puzzles or card games, pack a basket of activities and plan to spend the day with her. If she’s artistic in nature, bring supplies for her to paint, color or make another favorite craft.
If you can’t be together on Mother’s Day, set up a special Zoom video call with your family to wish your mom a beautiful day. You can even decorate the space behind you in your video call with balloons and streamers to add a festive feel.
#6: Send a Mother’s Day Care Package ?
If you can’t physically be with your loved one during this time, you can still show her how much you love her with a Mother’s Day care package. Fill it with items like sweet treats, lotions, candles, gift cards and more. Also include cards from her grandchildren, other family members or friends. A photo album of family and favorite events is another great addition.
Whatever you plan for Mother’s Day, make sure it’s manageable for your mother. You might have the best of intentions on ways to spend time together. However, if your mom is having health issues or struggling with mobility, it might not be as enjoyable. So, consult with her doctor or the assisted living or nursing home if you’re concerned. They may even be able to assist depending on your particular plans.
Whether your mom lives at home or in a senior living community, FirstLight® Home Care can provide the extra support, comfort and assistance she needs on Mother’s Day and every day of the year. Contact your local FirstLight Home Care today to find out more."
49,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/6-kidney-facts-national-kidney-month/,"Have you given much thought to your kidneys lately? These powerful organs regulate your body’s fluid levels, filter toxins from the blood, help in the production of red blood cells and much more – all in a matter of seconds.
Despite this, the National Kidney Foundation estimates one in three American adults are currently at risk for developing kidney disease, leading the organization to deem March as National Kidney Month. Because staying healthy means keeping your kidneys strong, especially as you age, here are six facts about your kidneys:
- Blood filtering: Because kidneys serve as your body’s main filtration system, blood flow through these organs is higher than in the heart, liver and brain. In one hour, approximately 120 pints of blood reach your kidneys and they filter your entire blood stream nearly 400 times a day.
- Vitamin D: Kidneys frequently activate vitamin D in your body, essential for healthy bone development. Healthy kidneys can help you avoid the negative side effects of a vitamin D deficiency such as fatigue or muscle weakness.
- Waste removal: Kidneys contain millions of nephrons that regulate the body’s water concentration. These help manage your body’s salt, acid and potassium levels to remove toxins and waste.
- Functionality: You may know that your body can function with just one kidney, but the sheer power of these organs might surprise you. Even if a lone kidney has a reduced functionality of 75 percent, it can still sustain life. This is possible because the nephrons are capable of enlarging to deal with added stress.
- Disease: A healthy kidney is a powerful thing, but it’s still susceptible to disease. In fact, kidney disease is the ninth leading cause of death in the U.S. The ailment frequently has little to no symptoms, meaning many people can have it without even knowing. High blood pressure and diabetes are the two leading causes of kidney disease.
- Prevention: In addition to screening your blood and urine to check for proper kidney function, people of all ages can take preventative steps to lower their risk of kidney disease. By reducing salt intake, moderating protein consumption, exercising regularly, avoiding smoking and staying hydrated, you’re more likely to have healthy kidneys – especially if you’re over the age of 60.
If you want healthier kidneys for you and your loved ones, it’s important to take advantage of the National Kidney Foundation’s free screenings for at-risk individuals throughout March. If you want to learn more about managing kidney health, especially for your aging loved ones, contact your local FirstLight Home Care today. Our caregivers are specially trained to manage the health of seniors and other at-risk adults wherever they call home."
50,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/6-things-you-must-ask-yourself-before-becoming-your-parents-caregiver/,"Every year, an estimated 43.5 million adults in the U.S.—about 60% of them women—become a parent’s caregiver. (Source: AARP). Taking care of someone you love is rewarding, but it does come with its own challenges.
Here are six things you must ask yourself before becoming your parent’s caregiver:
- Are you prepared for the physical challenges of caregiving? Many people sign up to be the primary caregiver out of a sense of duty or even guilt. While it is admirable to become the family caregiver, you may not be entirely prepared for the roller coaster of emotions and physical stress that can be taxing for even the strongest person. Depending on the amount of care your parent requires, you may have to help with a variety of physical tasks including lifting, bathing, dressing, bathroom needs, walking/mobility, feeding, and medical needs.
- Are you willing to make the hard decisions? Even with the best laid plans, when you are faced with a difficult choice that affects your loved one, there is added pressure. You want to know that you are doing your best to weigh all available options and provide quality care that is in line with your parents’ desires, even if they cannot vocalize them. Caregiving constantly presents difficult decisions where you can struggle with what you need and want to do for your loved one.
- Are you ready to make personal sacrifices? Providing elder care to a family member takes an extraordinary amount of time and energy. Before you become the primary caregiver, you need to be committed to maintaining some balance in your life. If you go years caring for someone else and avoid your own personal needs, your abilities as an attentive, organized and compassionate caregiver will deteriorate. Plan time for respite care to help maintain your health and happiness during your caregiving journey. You cannot pour from an empty cup.
- Are you ready for the financial impact? When taking on a caregiver role, adult children often must reduce their hours at work or even quit their jobs altogether. In addition to the income impact, caregivers may find themselves simultaneously taking on extra expenses. On average, family members serving as caregivers are spending nearly $7,000 of their own money each year on their loved one’s expenses–helping cover the cost of things like medical bills, utilities and food. (Source: National Alliance for Caregiving)
- Are you ready for a possible change in the relationship you have with your parent? One of the trickiest things about caring for an aging parent is when the child feels as if they have become the “parent”. The change in roles can feel like a loss. The person that you once knew as your mother or father may be changing rapidly. It is okay to feel sad or angry about any change in your relationship. In any situation, the key is to maintain mutual respect.
- Are you willing to accept help? The hardest thing most caregivers face is asking others for help. Many caregivers feel guilty when the day-to-day stress of caring for a parent becomes too much. Every caregiver needs a break. You must be ready to speak up and seek help from family or friends, or hire a professional home care provider who can help support you while allowing your loved one to be cared for in a familiar environment and comfortable surroundings.
Making the decision to become the sole caregiver means taking a lot of different factors into consideration. The family caregiver must understand the need for patience, compassion, unconditional love, and kindness for not just their loved one, but for themselves as well. And they must realize there will always be struggles both emotionally and physically when taking on this role.
We are proud to CHAMPION the family caregiver, offering empathy, advice, and support for those who provide countless hours of care to their loved ones. At FirstLight Home Care we want to provide a helping hand, relieve some of the stress that comes with caregiving and give you back a few hours in your overwhelmingly busy day.

51,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/6-tips-for-long-distance-family-caregivers/,"Many families live long distances from one another, and caregiving from afar is more prevalent today than it has been in years. Trends in family mobility and urbanization are moving more and more adult children farther from their aging parents, making family care more difficult.
If you are one of the many who don’t live nearby to care for your aging parents, no need to panic. You can still be actively involved and take on a meaningful caregiving role from miles away.
At FirstLight Home Care, we help many families living miles between loved ones and have found the following tips to be very helpful for long-distance caregivers who can’t be near their loved one to provide daily care.
Gather and organize all important documents
Find the following documentation and records and put them all into one binder: all legal, financial, and insurance documents, including birth certificates, social security cards, marriage or divorce decrees, wills and power of attorney. Identify bank accounts, titles, sources of income and obligations, and auto, life, homeowner’s, and medical insurance papers. Review these documents for accuracy and update them if necessary. Make a backup copy for your records and place everything in a safe place, such as a safe-deposit box or a fireproof box. Having all these key documents in one location will help you immensely when they’re needed.
Develop a care plan
If possible, bring the family together for a care planning meeting. Decide, with your aging loved one, what their primary needs are and who can aid in that care. Also, identify the local senior services and other resources that are available in the community. In a perfect world, you should summarize your plans in writing to refer to when a situation arises.
Plan your visits
It’s important that you see your loved one during the year to spend quality time with them, but also to reassess their care needs.
- Make appointments with their healthcare professionals, lawyer, and financial adviser during your visit to ask questions and participate in key decision-making.
- Meet with neighbors, friends and other local relatives to hear how they think the person is doing. Ask if there have been any behavioral changes, health problems or safety issues that you should be aware of and address them immediately.
- Spend quality time together talking, listening to music, going for a walk or participating in activities you enjoy together.
- Check your loved one’s pantry, cabinets and refrigerator to make sure there is enough appropriate food. Throw out any food that is expired. Help them prepare meals that can be frozen and enjoyed later.
- Review all medications to make sure they are being taken as prescribed.
- Coordinate family meetings to discuss how the care plan is working, what changes need to happen, or simply use this time to give the local family caregiver a break. If any changes are made to the care plan, update the original document and distribute to family members.
Survey the house
When you are visiting your loved one, use this time to evaluate their living conditions. Check each room to make sure the lighting is working properly, and remove potential trip hazards such as cords, furniture, and rugs. Walk around the house and yard to evaluate outdoor steps, landscaping, and lighting to ensure pathways are safe and clear. If something isn’t working properly or could be a safety hazard, fix it or hire a professional.
Stay Connected
Utilize today’s technology to communicate with doctors and caregivers. If a neighbor or friend regularly checks on your parent, call and get updates from them. Allocate time from your weekly schedule to call or video chat with your parent. Hearing their voice and catching up on their daily happenings will reduce the feelings that you are both isolated from each other.
Take good care of yourself
Caring for your parent – at any distance – can be stressful and overwhelming. In any case, you need to maintain your own health. Make time for yourself, set limits, and allow other family members and professional caregivers to help. Check out one of our most popular blog posts, Stress and the Family Caregiver, for additional tips that you might find helpful.

52,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/6-unusual-ways-to-beat-the-heat/,"Sometimes the summer heat can be unbearable. But, what do you do when you’ve tried everything to cool off? Try something new!
1. Eat to sweat. Some of the hottest places in the world have some of the spiciest, hottest cuisines. So, this summer, take a cue from these cultures. Incorporate spicy foods into your summer diet. While eating spicy foods, your internal temperature rises, your blood circulation increases and you begin sweating. Once the sweat evaporates, your body has cooled off.
2. Stay cool while sleeping. It is often difficult for people to sleep when the weather is hot. Put away the down and latex pillows and choose a cooler, more absorbent option to keep your head cool. If your sheets are too warm to sleep on, throw them in a plastic bag and in the freezer for a few hours before you go to bed.
3. Eat smaller meals. When you eat large meals, your body’s metabolism kicks it into overdrive to digest the meal, which heats your body. To avoid feeling hot after eating a meal, break your summer food intake into smaller meals eaten more frequently throughout the day.
4. Escape through reading. Spend the hot summer days reading a book set in the winter. Reading about the snow and cold temperatures will take your mind off of the rising thermometer. It also lets your mind think of your experiences with snow and ice, distracting you from the summer heat.
5. Treat yourself with cooling snacks. Be sure to stock up on your favorite cooling treats. Ice cream, popsicles and other flavored ice treats are perfect for the summer. You can also make your own frozen treats by freezing a bag of your favorite fruit like watermelon, pineapple, lemons and grapes.
6. Cool your pulse point. Chilling your pulse points can be done by simply running cold water over your wrists. You can also splash water on your face and temples to cool yourself down. And, don’t forget about drinking cold water—this not only cools you down but also helps you to remain hydrated."
53,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/6-ways-to-celebrate-halloween-with-your-elderly-parent/,"Are you looking for a spook-tacular way to safely celebrate Halloween with your elderly parent this weekend? FirstLight Home Care has these franken-tastic ideas to make this Halloween the best.
Adorn festive pumpkins. Skip carving a pumpkin this year – the trend is to paint them. It’s not only safer, but there is less mess, and It is easier for everyone, regardless of age, to join the fun.
Decorate the house. Set out your decorated pumpkins and add wreaths of fall foliage, spooky cobwebs, spooky figurines, bats, and spiders. Make it special, but also be sure it is safe for your elderly parent.
- Make certain all indoor and outdoor walkways are clear of decorations and other obstacles and that they are well lit.
- Do not place window decorations that block the light or view of the front door.
- Keep carved pumpkins outside, and use flameless candles to light them.
Enjoy a not-too-scary movie night. Make some tasty (and even healthy) treats, wrap up in a blanket and enjoy some not-too-scary movies. Here are a few of our favorites:
- Little Shop of Horrors
- Ghostbusters
- Casper
- Edward Scissorhands
- Beetlejuice
- Frankenweenie
- Young Frankenstein
Be safe with trick-or-treat during COVID-19. Handing out candy to the kids in your neighborhood is fun but doing so during COVID-19 might be too scary for your elderly parent. One option is to leave a bowl of candy outside the door and encourage them to watch from the window as families stroll the block dressed up in their costumes. When you run out of candy, put out a “Sorry, No More Sweets” sign so families can move to the next house.
Dress up and have some fun. The best part about Halloween…the costumes. If your elderly parent wants to don a costume, that is great. Assist them with their costume and let them show it off on Halloween night.
- Keep it simple. Complicated clothing may make it difficult to walk and/or manage trips to the restroom.
- Costumes for seniors should be safe and comfortable to wear and should not inhibit your caregiving duties.
- Avoid masks, if possible.
- Costumes, wigs and accessories should be fire-resistant.
Keep it low key. Halloween is a fun holiday but for an elderly parent living with Alzheimer’s disease or dementia, confusion and agitation can be heightened during this time. Excessive noise, the coming and going of strangers, and costumes can be disorienting for some. It is okay to keep things simple and just spend the evening together enjoying each other’s company. Read these additional Halloween safety tips from Alzheimer’s Universe.
Our FirstLight® Companion Care Services provides support for a few hours, or even overnight. We can be there to help distribute Halloween candy and, in between trick-or-treaters, we can share a conversation, play games, or watch their favorite television shows. Contact our local FirstLight office to learn more about our services."
54,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/6-ways-to-help-aging-loved-ones-adopt-healthier-habits/,"If you ask family caregivers, getting their aging loved ones to eat healthier foods can seem nearly impossible. Sadly, this problem isn’t uncommon: One in every eight Americans older than 65 are at risk for malnutrition, according to research conducted by Kaiser Permanente and the National Institutes of Health.
Various physical and mental conditions, as well as medications, can make aging adults less likely to get the nutrition they need to thrive. Whether the enemy is fast food, high cholesterol or a lack of vitamins, here are six ways to incorporate healthier habits (and maybe even some vegetables!) into your loved ones’ lifestyles.
1.Start by Talking
As people age, they may find that their experience with food changes. Physical infirmities, including teeth or stomach issues, can make eating more difficult. Taste buds can go numb, making certain foods unpleasant or inedible.
Talk with your loved one about the things that get in the way of eating well. Ask what foods they like, and what they don’t. Find out what’s easy for them to prepare on their own, if necessary. And take time to help them find new foods that they may be more interested in eating.
Finally, take some time to watch your loved one as they go about their day. When they prepare meals for themselves, where do they struggle? What tasks are most difficult for them? By paying attention, you can find out how to help them prepare food more effectively.
2. Provide Nutritious Foods
Before changing your loved one’s diet, make sure to check with their doctor about their specific dietary needs. Ask about the levels of protein, fat and carbohydrates they need, and for any other specific deficiencies or considerations.
Some of the most important foods for older adults to eat, according to MyPlate for Older Adults, are vegetables, fruits and lean or plant-based proteins. Rather than drinking juice, consider fresh, frozen, canned or dried fruits. The USDA also recommends fortified foods to supplement vitamin D and B12 intake.
3. Make Healthy Foods Easier to Eat
Even if your loved ones are getting the protein and raw foods they need, it’s important to remember other vitamins, minerals and fiber as well. Steaming vegetables and turning fruits into smoothies can make these foods easier to eat. Older adults can also prefer foods with stronger flavors, so be sure to season liberally with spices, garlic and other flavorful ingredients.
4. Shop Together
Spending the time to shop for groceries with a loved one can help you learn their tastes and habits and provide valuable time to talk about their food interests with them. While shopping, family caregivers can provide help in selecting healthy choices.
This can also provide an opportunity to cook together, which may encourage healthier eating. They will appreciate the chance to share a meal with you, and you’ll be helping them eat a little healthier — a win-win!
5. Find Junk Food Alternatives
Aging adults can come to prefer junk food due to their convenience, but these foods are loaded with unhealthy fats, salt and calories that can increase their health concerns. Healthy food isn’t impossible to find, but it can be more difficult if they don’t know where to look.
Work with them to understand how to make healthier choices while away from home, whether that involves choosing different menu options or restaurants. At home, make sure they have healthy snacks on hand, like pre-cut fruits and vegetables.
6. Plan and Prep Meals
While going out to eat can be a fun and important way to help your loved ones feel connected, it can also lead to poor dietary habits and health. Restaurant food is often filled with salt, fat and calories, which may exceed what your loved ones need.
If your caregiving responsibilities include cooking meals for your loved ones, consider planning and preparing meals in advance. This can help save you the hassle of cooking every night and can also make healthy food more accessible. Making large portions of different dishes can help introduce variety throughout the week without having to cook on busier days.
Small Steps Make the Difference
When it comes to introducing healthier habits and better diets for your loved ones, small steps can make that process easier for both of you. Don’t try to do everything at once. Instead, consider suggesting one or two nutritious options per week, and encouraging them to keep up with other important goals, like exercise and hydration. While some older adults can struggle to implement these changes on their own, with a little patience, you can play a pivotal role in helping them become healthier, one step at a time.
During this time, please know that FirstLight Home Care is fully operational, and our caregivers are available to help. The safety and well-being of our caregivers, clients and community have always been our top priority. That is why we have taken extra care to provide our team with the most up-to-date safety information and training to keep everyone protected and healthy."
55,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/7-activities-you-can-do-with-a-parent-this-summer/,"Summer is a fun and exciting time—the sun is out, the kids are out of school and the days are longer. But, sometimes the summer heat and humidity can be overwhelming, making it hard to spend extended amounts of time outdoors. So, how can you and your family enjoy the summer with your aging parent without having to brave the extreme heat? Try one of these fun summer activities:
Attend an outdoor concert.
This is an extremely popular activity in the summer. Outdoor concerts usually take place later in the evenings when the heat and humidity have died down for the day. Concerts can be a fun way to get your parent out of the house to enjoy the weather without having to deal with the extreme summer sun.
Join a book club.
Book clubs are the perfect summer afternoon activity. Spend time with friends or neighbors indoors in the air conditioning, discussing a new book. Not only does this give you and your parent something to do on meeting days, but it also gives you a good book to read throughout the week before your club meets.
Visit a museum or other local attraction.
On days that your parent wants to get out of the house but doesn’t want to deal with the heat, head to a museum or local attraction. Often, these venues are air conditioned and provide a fun and potentially educational day trip.
Volunteer in the community.
Summer is full of community events. Volunteer together at your church’s Vacation Bible School, the community’s summer festival, the county fair or even somewhere like the local public library.
Organize their house.
Take advantage of the air conditioning in your parent’s home by organizing your belongings. Tackle some of the projects that they have been putting off for a rainy day. Hot summer days may leave your parent stuck inside, so use that time to do something productive.
Start gardening.
Mornings and evenings are the perfect time to be outside in the summer heat. It’s not too hot and it gives you and your parent the opportunity to enjoy the fresh air. Plant a small garden or fill window boxes with flowers, vegetables or herbs.
Go out for ice cream.
Who doesn’t enjoy a delicious ice cream cone on a hot and humid day? Make a quick trip out with your parent and family for a refreshingly cool treat!"
56,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/7-early-signs-of-dementia/,"Dementia is a term that describes a variety of symptoms affecting a person’s cognitive functioning. The most recognizable being their ability to think, remember and reason. It is a disease that can be characterized by a decline in memory, language, problem-solving and other thinking skills that affect a person’s ability to perform everyday activities.
Every person is unique, and dementia affects people differently – no two people will have symptoms that develop in the same way. Signs of dementia can go unnoticed for a long time because the changes that occur in your loved one can be small at first. But over time they become more obvious.
The most common early symptoms of dementia are:
Memory loss: Most people occasionally forget things more frequently as they age. They usually can recall them later if their memory loss is age-related and not due to dementia. A person with dementia, however, may find it difficult to recall information they have recently learned, such as dates, events or new information. They will also often experience problems with memory that can affect their day-to-day activities.
Difficulty concentrating: An early sign of dementia is the impact on one’s attention span and ability to concentrate. Your loved one may get distracted easily and have difficulty focusing which can impact their ability to problem solve, as well as decrease their learning speed and cause them to have a slower reaction time.
Mood or behavior changes: Another early sign of dementia is a change in personality, such as feeling fearful, anxious, confused, depressed or suspicious when out of their comfort zone. Your loved one may also be very emotional and have extreme mood swings.
Difficulty finding the right words: Struggling to communicate thoughts can be another indication of the disease. A person with dementia may have difficulty explaining something or finding the right words to express themselves.
Misplacing things: A person with dementia may not be able to remember where they leave everyday objects, such as the remote control, important documents, cash or their keys. They may act out and become paranoid or accusatory of others of stealing their belongings.
Challenges completing normal tasks: A subtle shift in the ability to complete normal tasks may indicate that someone is experiencing cognitive decline. This usually starts showing when they have difficulty doing more complex tasks like balancing a checkbook or playing games that have a lot of rules. Along with the challenge to complete familiar tasks, they may also struggle to learn how to do new things or follow new routines.
Withdrawal from social or work activities: Someone in the early stages of the disease may begin to isolate themselves from work or social gatherings because of other changes like confusion, disorientation and loss of speech. They may withdraw out of embarrassment or fear.
Dementia is more common in people over the age of 65, but it can affect younger people too. If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with dementia, we have dementia care services that not only support the dementia sufferer but the family as a whole.

57,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/7-heart-healthy-tips-for-seniors/,"February is American Heart Month, an ideal time to commit to making small changes that can lead to a lifetime of heart health. Did you know that cardiovascular disease is a major threat to senior health? The American Heart Association reports that 84 percent of people age 65 years and older die from heart disease.
Here are seven smart heart-healthy tips to help seniors take care of their hearts and reduce the risk of heart disease. If you are an adult child caring for your parent, here is some advice you can give them to promote well-being and help them live a healthy lifestyle.
Maintain a healthy weight. Extra weight may increase the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and bone issues. Maintaining an ideal body weight is tough, especially as you age. Therefore, eating right, portion control and exercise are the keys to a healthy heart.
Fiber. Fiber. Fiber. Including fiber in your diet is crucial. It keeps you full and helps lower blood cholesterol levels. Fiber-rich foods, which include fruits, vegetables, beans, whole-grain bread and nuts, are great options to help keep your heart healthy.
Get Moving. Regular physical activity is an essential aspect of a heart-healthy lifestyle. As little as thirty minutes of moderate exercise each day can help seniors improve their heart health and lower their blood pressure.
Eat Colorfully. Seniors should get at least five servings of fruits and vegetables each day. They’re low in calories and high in vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Fill your plate with as many shades of veggies as possible, as each color indicates a concentration of a specific nutrient. If fresh fruits and veggies are not readily available, consider buying frozen or canned. These contain the same vitamins and minerals but are often more cost-efficient.
Quit Smoking. Drink Less. Smoking tobacco products and drinking alcohol – no matter your age – can affect the heart. Smoking increases the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease and stroke. Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol can cause raised blood pressure, which can lead to heart attack or stroke.
Reduce Stress. Everyone copes with stress in different ways. Chronic stress and anxiety are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, according to the American Heart Association. The AHA suggests these tips to help relieve stress and improve your overall mood:
- Practice deep breathing
- Do yoga or stretching exercises
- Pet a dog or cat
- Talk with a friend
- Go for short walks
- Participate in hobbies and other activities you enjoy
Get Your ZZZ’s. Sleep deprivation or poor sleep quality can disrupt your metabolism, impact your blood pressure and increase inflammation in the body, which may lead to an increased risk of heart disease. Medicare.com recommends that older adults get eight hours of quality sleep each night. To improve sleep quality, try establishing a bedtime routine, avoid excess caffeine during the day and consider taking a short nap during the day.
It’s never too late to start living a heart-healthy lifestyle to reduce your heart disease risk. If necessary, help your aging parent work with their doctor to keep health problems under control. And if you need help with heart-healthy meal planning or transportation to and from exercise classes or doctor appointments, our Companion Care Services may be just what you need.

The health focused folks over at WebMD put together a great slideshow on 18 secrets for a Longer Life (which we guess really aren’t that much of a secret since they have it on their website that millions of people view each month). We went through the slideshow and picked out some of our favorites that we’ve started to try (we can already feel the years being added on to our lives).
- Eat Like an Okinawan: The people of Okinawa, Japan once had the longest life expectancy in the world. Researchers attribute this to the region’s traditional diet, which is high in green and yellow vegetables and low in calories. Some Okinawans make a habit of eating only 80% of the food on their plate. As younger generations have veered from these traditions, life expectancy in Okinawa has fallen.
- Nap: One of our favorites! A siesta is standard in many parts of the world, and now there’s scientific evidence that napping may help you live longer. A recent study with 24,000 participants suggests that regular nappers are 37% less likely to die from heart disease than occasional nappers. Researchers think naps might help the heart by keeping stress hormones down.
- Get Married: Several studies show that married people tend to outlive their single counterparts. Many researchers attribute the difference to the social and economic support marriage provides. While a current marriage offers the greatest benefit, people who are divorced or widowed have lower mortality rates than those who have never been married.
- Follow a Mediterranean Diet: The Mediterranean diet is high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, olive oil, and fish. An analysis of 50 studies involving more than half a million people shows the impressive benefits of this diet. The findings show it significantly lowers the risk of metabolic syndrome — a combination of obesity, elevated blood sugar, increased blood pressure, and other factors that raise the risk of heart disease and diabetes.
- Lose Weight: If you’re overweight, slimming down can protect against diabetes, heart disease, and other life-shortening conditions. Belly fat appears to be particularly harmful, so focus on deflating that spare tire. A 5-year study of Hispanics and African-Americans suggests eating more fiber and exercising regularly are effective ways to reduce belly fat.
- Get Moving: The evidence is overwhelming — people who exercise live longer on average than those who don’t. According to dozens of studies, regular physical activity reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, some forms of cancer, and depression. Exercise may even help you stay mentally sharp into old age. Ten-minute spurts of activity are fine, as long as they add up to about 2.5 hours of moderate exercise per week.
- Forgive: Letting go of grudges has surprising physical health benefits. Chronic anger is linked to decreased lung function, heart disease, stroke, and other ailments. Forgiveness will reduce anxiety, lower blood pressure, and help you to breathe more easily. These benefits tend to increase as you get older.

59,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/7-ways-to-fight-caregiver-burnout/,"One in three adults in the U.S. cares for an aging or disabled loved one. If you’re one of these family caregivers, you know how demanding the role can be. It can lead to caregiver stress in the form of burnout, fatigue, exhaustion and even resentment toward your family member. It can also cause frustration and guilt, which can take a heavy toll on your mind and body.
In fact, according to a report from AARP, 36% of family caregivers would describe their situation as “highly stressful.” In addition, the number of caregivers who would characterize themselves as in excellent health has dropped from 48% in 2015 to 41% in 2020. It’s no wonder, as studies have shown that caregiving can lead to physical ailments, like high blood pressure, depression and anxiety.
The good news is, there are ways to avoid caregiver burnout and maintain a healthy balance in your life. This is important not only for you, but your loved one as well.
Are You Suffering from Caregiver Burnout and Stress?
If you’re noticing more irritability than usual, depression, exhaustion, or an increase in health problems, you could be suffering from burnout. Here are some tips to cope:
#1: Accept Help
Sometimes, the biggest stumbling block is reaching out, asking for and accepting help. It’s difficult to think you can’t handle everything on your own. However, the reality is that when a loved one requires ongoing care and support, it’s impossible to handle it all alone. You need help, whether it’s from friends, family, church groups, neighbors, or others. So, be willing to accept it.
#2: Talk it Out
If you’re struggling with stress from caregiving – and dealing with mental health issues as a result – talk to a friend or even a counselor. These are normal emotions to have. Learning how to cope with them and overcome them will help you regain your mental balance and sense of well-being.
#3: Join a Support Group
In today’s tech-driven world, there are family caregiver support groups you can join all over the country. Social media sites, like Facebook, even have private groups you can join to ask questions, share your struggles related to caregiver stress and get and provide comfort. This can also lift your spirits and provide hope that you’re not alone.
#4: Outsource and Delegate
Are there certain errands you could outsource for your loved one? For instance, could you have their groceries delivered on a weekly basis? Could you hire a housekeeper to clean their home and do their laundry? Are there other areas where you could hire a company to handle a task, like mowing the lawn and home maintenance? The more you’re able to outsource and delegate to others, the less will be on your list to complete. This will go a long way in reducing caregiver stress.
#5: Have Fun
Stepping away and spending time with your family and friends, as well as socializing are important to a healthy, balanced life. Don’t feel guilty for taking time away from caregiving to have fun. You need it to improve your perspective and your mood.
#6: Stay Fit
Make sure you’re taking care of your own health. This can include a well-balanced diet, exercise, ample sleep and limited alcohol. Just a few minor adjustments, such as drinking more water during the day, can go a long way in making you feel healthier and stronger. Also make sure you’re taking care of your medical needs and going to your own doctor for regular check-ups.
#7: Take Breaks from the Stress of Being a Caregiver
This sounds easy enough. However, if you don’t have a family member or friend to step in and care for your loved one, it can feel impossible. If this is your situation, consider an adult day care or professional caregivers who can offer you respite help. They will aid and support your loved one in many ways, while you step away and get the rest you need.
Caregiving is a rewarding role. However, it’s also highly stressful. It’s important to take breaks and take care of yourself to maintain your own health and life. It’s not something to feel guilty about. In fact, when you return to care for your loved one, you’ll be able to do so with more patience, compassion and energy. It’s truly a win for you both.

60,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/8-ways-to-deal-with-caregiver-stress/,"It can be overwhelming to take care of a loved one who is aging or one living with cognitive problems or a disability. Too much stress can be harmful to you and to the one in your care. It’s important to recognize the signs of caregiver stress and to put actions in place to manage and reduce your stress and anxiety levels.
Signs of caregiver stress
As a caregiver, you are “on call” almost all the time. This ongoing demand can make you become so focused on the loved one in your care, that you forget about yourself. You put your own health and well-being on the backburner in order to take care of them and their everyday needs.
Stress from caregiving can sneak up on you. It’s important to keep watch for these signs of caregiver stress:
- Feeling overwhelmed or constantly worried
- Feeling tired often
- Getting too much sleep or not enough sleep
- Gaining or losing weight
- Becoming easily irritated or angry
- Losing interest in activities you used to enjoy
- Feeling sad for no reason
- Having frequent headaches, bodily pain or other physical problems
- Abusing alcohol or drugs, including prescription medications
Ways to manage and reduce caregiver stress
Accept help. Make a list of the ways family and friends can help you and let them choose what they would like to do. Be specific and let them know the days and times that you could use their help.
Set daily goals. Having a laundry list of tasks that must get done each week can be overwhelming. Breakdown your week into daily goals and then prioritize, make lists and establish a daily routine.
Exercise regularly. Schedule time each day to do some type of physical activity. Not only will it help you stay fit, but exercise is also a stress reliever. Being active can boost your feel-good endorphins and distract you from daily worries.
Eat a healthy, balanced diet. Unhealthy eating patterns can cause stress levels to skyrocket and potentially increase your risk of health problems in the future. Being stressed can increase your needs for certain nutrients, such as vitamin C, vitamin, B, selenium (an antioxidant that fights oxidative stress and helps defend the body from chronic diseases), and magnesium. A well-balanced and nutritious diet is one of the most important ingredients for good health.
Get plenty of sleep. Not getting quality sleep over a long period of time can cause health issues. If you have trouble getting a good night’s sleep, talk to your doctor.
Join a support group. If you’re feeling alone and overwhelmed, finding a local support group can provide connection and interaction, as well as problem-solving strategies for difficult situations. The people in support groups will be nonjudgmental to your situation. They understand what you may be going through and can provide counsel, support, and even friendship.
Take a well-deserved break. Everyone needs time away to relieve stress and restore energy. And, let’s face it…taking personal time for yourself can do a world of good! Hiring an outside source to offer support with respite care – from a few hours each week to several days – can allow family caregivers to step away from caregiving responsibilities and take care of themselves. Respite care is an essential part of being a caregiver.
Keep your doctor appointments. Studies have shown that caregivers are likely to suffer from several health problems. Make it a priority to see your doctor regularly to discuss any concerns or symptoms you have.

61,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/a-family-caregivers-guide-to-senior-safety-and-emergency-preparedness/,"September focuses on Falls Prevention and Emergency Preparedness
If you’re a family caregiver, you may, at some point, need to handle an unexpected situation when it comes to your loved one. It could be anything from helping them stay safe during a natural disaster to helping them heal after a serious fall. Family caregivers should have a plan in place to help in emergency situations. At the very least, they should have a conversation with the person they’re caring for about the potential risks and what they can do to be prepared.
If you or someone you know is a family caregiver, this quick guide to falls prevention and emergency preparedness can help keep your aging loved one safe inside the place they call home.
Preventing falls
Falls are the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal injuries for older Americans, according to the National Council on Aging. They can result in hip fractures, cuts, and even serious head and brain injuries. Sometimes a fall is so frightening that seniors may avoid certain activities because they’re worried that they’ll fall again.
Although falls are not a normal part of aging, most of us do lose some coordination, flexibility, and balance as we age. This can increase our potential to fall. There are some ways to help prevent falls in your elderly loved one:
- Remove clutter. The simplest way to prevent falls is to remove clutter from floors, hallways, staircase, and sidewalks around your loved one’s home.
- Fix trip hazards. Review every room of the house and identify potential trip hazards. Fix, remove, or repair items such as loose carpets, throw rugs, uneven flooring, electrical cords, or unnecessary furniture.
- Install grab bars and handrails. Hire a handyman or have a family member install grab bars by toilets and bathtubs and handrails in stairways and hallways. Most seniors have lived in their homes for a long time and have never thought about simple modifications that might keep them safer as they age.
- Install proper lighting. Inadequate lighting is another major hazard that can cause a fall. Install brighter light bulbs during the day and evening. At night, add night lights in bedrooms and bathrooms for better guidance.
- Encourage shoes, even in the home. Preventing falls at home can be as simple as wearing shoes. Socks might be more comfortable than shoes, but they can also be slippery. Encourage your loved one to wear shoes, even inside the house.
- Purchase non-slip mats. Many falls happen in the bathroom, kitchen, and outdoor porches. The surfaces in these areas can become extremely dangerous when wet. To reduce falls in these common living spaces, install non-slip mats.
- Urge your older adult to slow down. Remind them to stop and smell the roses, even when they’re at home. Many falls at home are caused by your elderly loved one moving too quickly when getting into or out of a sitting or lying down position. It is important for them to take their time. Advise them to pause before sitting or standing to get acclimated to their environment before moving. Additionally, some prescriptions and over-the-counter medications can cause dizziness, dehydration or interactions with each other that can lead to a fall.
Falls Prevention Awareness Day takes place on the first day of Fall each year (this year, that day is September 23). The National Council on Aging (NCOA) has organized some webinars and social media activities on and around that day. Join the NCOA for these special 2019 events.
Preparing for an emergency
There are also some things you should focus on as a caregiver in order to be prepared for an emergency, whether it’s a power outage, house fire or natural disaster.
- Create an emergency communications plan that includes a list of who to call so that all family members can be informed.
- Put together an emergency kit that includes enough food and water for several days. Don’t forget about the family pets.
- Create an easy, safe evacuation plan in case your loved one cannot stay in their home after a disaster situation.
- Have easy access to your loved one’s important legal, financial and health records/paperwork.
- Keep a list of community resources and contact information, including fire and police departments, doctor and hospital, power supplier, etc.
- Print off this emergency preparedness checklist for caregivers from the Family Caregiver Alliance.

62,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/a-great-gift-for-your-aging-parents/,"Because we live in Denver, to say it is cold in the winter is an understatement. Of course, due to frigid temperatures and cars that sit outside, it’s exactly the time of year our batteries seems to go dead. Go figure.
As I watched me elderly father try to jump his battery in the freezing cold, a brilliant thought hit me … why not give him a gift membership to AAA? I am always looking for gifts for my aging parents and I am often stuck for ideas. I have a basic AAA membership which costs me only $75/year and is worth every penny. A gift membership only costs $37.
Here are the benefits your aging parents will enjoy:
- 24-hour roadside assistance. My parents travel a lot and I am always afraid they will get stranded with a flat tire, a broken down vehicle or run out of gas. AAA covers them 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in both U.S. and Canada!
- Discounts. Because my aging parents are on a limited income, they are always looking for bargains. We don’t go to a restaurant unless they have a coupon! They can get discounts on hotel/motel reservations + restaurant coupons.
- Lockout service. Ever locked your keys in your car? I can’t see my Dad trying the coat hanger trick! If your keys are locked inside the vehicle, AAA will help you. If they cannot gain entry, a locksmith will be called and services up to $50 will be provided.
- Trip interruption benefits due to a collision. Let’s admit it … as we age my
Father’s eyesight gets worse and his night driving is sketchy at best. If they’re
on a trip 100 miles away from home, a rental car will be provided if they have
a Plus membership."
63,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/a-helpful-dozen-12-online-resources-for-family-caregivers/,"A recent report from the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine concluded that there’s more to caring for the older adult population than services and support for aging individuals. An equally urgent need is resources for the family caregiver who is so integral to their care.
The report found that nearly 18 million Americans care for a relative older than 65. And that those providing support are often thrust into the family caregiving role without the preparation, services, support and information they need. The Academies said “the need to recognize and support caregivers is among the most significant challenges” facing our exploding elderly population. They urged, “Supporting family caregivers should be an integral part of the nation’s collective responsibility for caring for its older adult population.”
For so many, taking on the role of family caregiver is uncharted territory. But with millions of others who have navigated that territory, there are plenty of resources from professionals and peers who know it well.
As we continue to recognize National Family Caregivers Awareness Month, FirstLight has assembled a collection of a dozen of the most useful online caregiving resources. These resources can help family caregivers ask the right questions, find a supportive community and reduce some of the stress and uncertainty that naturally come with the family caregiver role.
AARP Caregiving
AARP provides one of the most comprehensive websites for family caregivers. It addresses issues directly related to serving as a family caregiver, such as planning, organization and caregiving tips. It caters to first-time caregivers with specialized resources. And it provides insight about other related issues caregivers should think about, like benefits and insurance, legal and financial issues and self-care.
AgingCare.com
AgingCare.com is a website, but also a community for family caregivers. It focuses on the exchange of ideas with and answers to questions from a panel of knowledgeable professionals, experts and other caregivers. The site also provides ratings and information about assisted living, senior living and in-home care. Its core services include an information exchange forum, support groups and a robust search feature to help family caregivers find facilities, providers and additional resources.
Caring.com
One of the first comprehensive online resources for aging, caring.com remains a leading destination for family caregivers seeking information and support as they care for a loved one. The site’s mission is “to help the helpers.” Resources are designed to help family caregivers make better decisions, save time and money and feel less alone in their caregiving journeys. The site includes support groups, as well as a variety of resources and ratings for assisted living, senior living and in-home care providers. It also includes countless articles about aging in place, health conditions, caregiving and more.
Caregiver Action Network (CAN)
CAN is a leading organization for family caregivers, working to help improve their quality of life. The CAN website includes an extensive toolbox with articles, how-tos and videos about specific caregiving issues. It also includes a forum where family caregivers can connect and get advice from peers.
eXtension
eXtension provides research and resources for local government cooperative extension programs, which use scientific, community-based activities to help improve people’s lives. While the organization works primarily with professionals, its website has an area specifically for family caregivers. And it contains some resources – like information about disaster preparedness and military family caregiving – that aren’t easily found elsewhere. The site also includes caregiving webinars and an “Ask the Expert” feature that allows users to submit caregiving questions, as well as search and view answers to previous questions.
Family Caregiver Alliance
The Family Caregiver Alliance is a community-based nonprofit organization specifically addressing the needs of family members and friends providing long-term care for loved ones at home. Among the many resources the Alliance provides is its Family Care Navigator. This tool provides a state-by-state online guide to help caregivers identify resources in their communities. It includes referrals to providers of legal help and advocacy, services for family caregivers, living accommodations, assistance with living at home, support for specific diseases, government programs and more.
Medicare Caregiver Resources
Among the many things family caregivers must navigate are healthcare expenses and insurance. With Medicare providing the funding for so many healthcare services for older adults, it’s important that family caregivers understand what’s covered – and what’s not. The Caregiver Resources section of the Medicare website provides information, stories and newsletters about taking care of someone with Medicare.
National Association of Area Agencies on Aging (n4a)
Area Agencies on Aging are local organizations that are expert on all aspects of aging. Community-based, these organizations are focused on helping older adults and their caregivers access local education and resources. n4a represents the 622 Area Agencies on Aging across the United States. The organization’s website includes the tool “Find Aging Resources in Your Area,” which lets users search by zip code for agencies in their communities.
National Caregivers Library
The National Caregivers Library is a clearinghouse for free information and tools for caregivers. It includes hundreds of articles and topic-specific resources. And it also provides access to elements that can’t be easily found elsewhere, including forms and checklists to help caregivers with everything from care and meal planning to medication management and much more.
Next Step In Care
The Next Step In Care website was created specifically for caregivers who are coordinating care of chronically ill loved ones at home — and managing various medical resources like physicians, rehabilitation providers and hospitals. The purpose of the site is to help ensure that transitions in care – moving patients from one setting (like a hospital) to another (like their homes) – are safe and smooth. The site includes guides to help family caregivers more proactively work with healthcare providers to ensure the best care and treatment for their loved ones. It also provides guides for first-time family caregivers, as well as how-tos for working with hospitals, rehabilitation centers and home care providers.
Today’s Caregiver
Today’s Caregiver was the first national magazine dedicated to caregivers. Today, the publication maintains a website of extensive resources for family caregivers. The site includes links to magazine articles, a variety of newsletters, a store for purchasing books and other caregiving resources, recipes and links to local organizations. It also includes “Channels,” which connect caregivers with resources about everything from long-distance caregiving to specific diseases. The site’s Book Club recommends the best reads for everything related to family caregiving. And its “Caretips” forum enables caregivers to read and share their best learnings and insights about being a family caregiver.
U.S. Administration on Aging Eldercare Locator
The Eldercare Locator provided by the U.S. Administration on Aging is a hyperlocal resource to connect family caregivers to help right in their communities. Zip-code searches can provide users with referrals not only to local aging organizations, but also to financial assistance, food and nutrition programs, insurance, in-home services, housing, transportation and more. An online chat function also connects users to a live expert for answering questions.
More Resources
One of the most comprehensive listings of resources for older adults and their family caregivers is provided by the Rosalyn Carter Institute for Caregiving, an organization supporting both professional and family caregivers. The Caregiver Resources section of the website includes descriptions and links to more than 100 organizations with resources ranging from general caregiving information to guides about specific diseases.
More Support, from FirstLight
Caregiving can be complicated. But family caregivers don’t have to do it alone. If you need support and advice on your caregiving journey, FirstLight can help. Our Just Ask FirstLight service connects you to an expert who can answer your questions about caregiving and guide you to additional resources."
64,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/a-tragic-situation/,"Recently, a situation came to light in the Denver, Colorado news about a man who obviously was suffering from some type of dementia. The wife had left apparently due to some behavior problems and the family tried unsuccessfully to intervene. A social worker interviewed the man and found he needed a thorough assessment by a physician to determine both physical and cognitive health issues. Due to the man’s refusal of treatment, the family filed a court injunction to have him taken to a hospital for evaluation. A police officer went to the home; however, after a conversation with the man, determined he was competent and decided not to follow the court order. Obviously the outcome was tragic. This very sad situation spotlights the need for education, understanding and negotiation skills for everyone from families to law enforcement about people suffering from all types of dementia.
When initially meeting and talking with someone with dementia they can appear normal. Their sense of self-preservation gives them the ability to cover the signs and symptoms of the disease. Carrying on light conversation with family keeps the advancing symptoms temporarily hidden. Those living with or close to this person have a different view of the situation. Their perspective encompasses not simply snippets of time but entire days, weeks and months. They see the person losing ground both cognitively and physically exposing more acutely the symptoms of dementia. Concerns for the safety and well being of the person should always remain the priority.
My mother in law, Martha, who has Alzheimer’s disease, began with little to no cognitive decline. She continued to drive, live alone but began to complain about her memory which she had always been so very proud. Her ability to remember dates, numbers, and details of situations was remarkable until her dementia illness. Over the course of the last 7 years she has become increasingly forgetful to the point she nearly set the kitchen on fire with a forgotten pot of green beans at which time the family felt she was no longer safe to live in her own home. This conversation had to be handled delicately. For those of you who have had to take the car keys away or make any change to a loved one’s life knows all too well how stubborn, sensitive and ultimately intimate the discussion turns. Often it is best if another person besides the family can assist with this intervention to help bridge the emotions with reason. Geriatric care managers are educated in how to break down the fears, concerns and begin to develop a plan for the transition. Others in the community who can help are ministers and counselors who can manage the dynamics of a family meeting.
Not unlike the situation in Denver, Martha continues to decline both physically and mentally. However, with the support of family and FirstLight Home Care dementia certified caregivers she is living in our homes and having daily experiences which make her feel both purposeful and good. We reminisce together about her early childhood, raising her 6 children and how much she enjoyed cooking and baking. On good days you can see a glimmer of the Martha I first met such as when we make chicken salad or fold clothes together some Saturday’s. She has become physically frail, does not like to drink or take a bath. Our caregivers know Martha and what makes her feel good. They know she will always drink buttermilk no matter what time of day. To help her get a shower they have found she likes to pick out her own towel and set up the bathroom with her powder, perfume and makeup just as she used to at home.
Would it not be wonderful to see a cure for dementia? This has been receiving so much attention but additionally more community awareness, education and planning need to occur to have a positive impact on those suffering from dementia today. Along with the focus on a cure for Alzheimer’s disease, observing and recognizing situations around us will help more people with dementia today. Looking out for neighbors, friends, family and finding resources in your local community is the first step to better treatment and care for everyone suffering from this disease and those affected. We need to eliminate the stigma associated with dementia and work together to educate our society. As a wise man once said, you never know when it could happen to you!"
65,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/activities-for-loved-ones-with-alzheimers-or-dementia/,"November is National Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Month. When spending time with seniors who have Alzheimer’s or dementia, it is important consider what they enjoyed doing before they began to lose their memory. Find an activity that makes them feel purposeful—they may not remember what they did that day but they will remember how they felt doing it.
Go through photo albums.
This is a fun activity for people with memory challenges and you might hear a story you’ve never heard before. Seeing the old pictures takes them back to a time that they can remember—the memories are still there and they can tell stories about family and friends from the years past.
Plant a flower or vegetable garden.
Gardening can be fun and relaxing for seniors with Alzheimer’s or dementia. To make gardening easier, create a tabletop garden with pots or a window box that is within reach. Help them plant flowers, herbs, vegetables and more in their personal gardens.
Listen to familiar music.
Get your loved one to sing along with their favorite tunes or do a little dance. Hearing certain songs may bring back memories of specific events or times in their life and may lead to reminiscing about the past.
Plan a celebration.
Involve your loved one with party preparations. Let them help you put together party decorations, prepare food or set the table for the party. They will enjoy the party and feel accomplished because they helped to contribute something to the celebration.
Go fishing.
For men (and women too!) fishing can be a great way to spend the afternoon. Not only will it bring back great memories, but it will also get them out and enjoying the outdoors. Fishing may require more supervision than before but your loved ones will be happy to return to their favorite fishing sites together.
Bake together.
Bring out your loved one’s favorite recipes and fire up the oven. Bake bread, cookies, cakes or any other specialties and spend some time in the kitchen. The familiar smells can bring back memories of the many other times that they prepared these recipes.
For loved ones who are in the later stages of Alzheimer’s or dementia, try one of these activities:
- Take a car ride around their old neighborhoods or towns
- Watch old comedies like I Love Lucy and The Andy Griffith Show
- Toss a balloon back and forth—it’s fun and helps with coordination
What are your favorite activities to do with a loved one who has Alzheimer’s or dementia?"
66,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/activities-seniors-can-do-at-home/,"If you’re caring for a senior at home and venturing out less in order to keep them – and you – safe and healthy, we know it may be difficult to keep them entertained and engaged. But do not fear! Thanks to some excellent sources out there, we found tons of activities you can do with your loved one while you’re social distancing and staying indoors. Some of these may also be fun for the kiddos who need a break from their non-traditional school work.
Take a Virtual Tour
Zoos, aquariums, museums, and theme parks are offering virtual tours. Seniors can explore the following online from the comfort of your own home:
- Animals in their own habitat through live-streaming webcams

67,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/address-possible-safety-hazards/,"As we transition into autumn, and eventually into more wintry weather, it’s the perfect time to consider the safety, health, and well-being of older adults who are aging in the place they call home…especially if they are living alone.
If you’re a family caregiver assisting an aging senior, now is the time to address all potential safety hazards, health challenges and home maintenance issues your loved one may face as they prepare for this season of change.
Inspect the HVAC system. Cold temperatures can be difficult for the elderly. Schedule a regular maintenance check for your parents’ home heating system to confirm it’s in good working order. If their home has a fireplace, be sure to also have chimneys inspected and cleaned to prevent dangers such as flue fires.
Clean up the leaves. While colorful leaves are part of the beauty of autumn in many regions, they can present safety hazards. When wet, leaves become slippery and pose a fall risk. And piles of leaves can hide potentially dangerous obstacles. Be sure to remove them regularly from porches, sidewalks and key walkways for older adults.
One of the biggest safety hazards that older individuals face is the risk of slipping and falling. According to the Centers for Disease Control, more than one in four older adults aged 65 and older will fall. This represents 29 million falls, 3 million emergency visits, 800,000 hospitalizations, and 28,000 deaths.
Don’t forget Daylight Saving Time. On Sunday, November 3, most Americans will set their clocks back one hour as daylight saving time comes to an end. As you are turning back your clocks, use this time to check smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and replace batteries as needed to ensure they’re working properly.
Discuss driving at night. The days are getting shorter and it’s starting to get dark earlier. Driving after dark also can mean reduced visibility. Check-in with your loved one to make sure they are still comfortable with driving at night. If they are not, offer alternative means to get them where they need to be before the sun goes down. Many home care agencies like FirstLight offer transportation services to and from appointments and assist with errands, such as grocery shopping.
Get a flu shot. The flu vaccine is especially important for older adults who are more susceptible to catching the flu virus. Doctors say now is the time to get a flu shot as we could be in for a nasty flu season this year. The frequency and severity of sicknesses escalate as the year ends, so the sooner, the better.
Take advantage of the harvest. Many healthy – and delicious – fruits and vegetables are center stage this time of year. Encourage your elderly loved one to add seasonal produce such as beets, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, apples, cranberries, eggplant and kale to their diet. These foods can help manage diabetes, contribute to heart health and promote a healthy immune system.
As temperatures drop and the seasons’ change, let FirstLight Home Care help. Our team of non-medical, in-home senior caregivers can provide companion and personal care services to make it possible for you to take a little respite while your loved one stays safe, healthy and steers clear of potential fall and winter hazards.
We are proud to CHAMPION the family caregiver, offering empathy, advice, and support for those who provide countless hours of care to their loved ones. At FirstLight Home Care we want to provide a helping hand, relieve some of the stress that comes with caregiving and give you back a few hours in your overwhelmingly busy day.

68,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/advanced-directives/,"None of us can predict when we are going to be suddenly incapacitated. You’re driving down the road, minding your own business and bam! Before you know it, you are in a car accident!
Or maybe you find yourself in an unexpected coma. Although we hope it never happens, you have to be prepared. You want to be in control of your own healthcare options if you are too ill to express your own wishes.
Advanced directives are legal documents that allow you to express your end-of-life wishes should the situation arise. In most states, these consist of two documents: a living will and a healthcare or medical power of attorney. These two documents spell out to your doctors or a hospital what type of medical care you would like if you are unable to tell them yourself.
Your advanced directives can me amended at any time, as long as you are of sound mind to do so. You must be able to think rationally and communicate clearly your wishes. Any time you make a change, you need to have your advanced directives signed and notarized and preferably give them to your physician, hospital, attorney, caregiver, and healthcare power of attorney.
You do not need a lawyer to prepare these documents, although it is advisable. These are usually prepared by an estate attorney. You can download a living will form and a healthcare proxy or medical durable power of attorney form here. Make sure you choose one from the state you are living in, and if you move, you will need to sign a new one.
A Living Will
A living will is a legal document where you spell out the level of care regarding life-prolonging medical treatments. It does not become effective until you are incapacitated. It gives you a choice whether or not you want your life prolonged in the case of 1) an incurable and irreversible condition that will result in your death within a relatively short time; 2) you become unconscious and, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, you will not regain consciousness; and 3) ) the likely risks and burdens of treatment would outweigh the expected benefits. A living will can be as general or specific as you want it to be. You can also put in special clauses which state:
- If you want dialysis and/or a breathing machine
- If you want to be resuscitated if your breathing or heartbeat stops
- If you want to be fed or given water artificially through a tube
- If you want your organs or tissue donated should they be viable
- If you want blood transfusions
A Healthcare Proxy or Durable Medical Power of Attorney
Each state refers to this document by different names (also known as healthcare power of attorney) or even combines these two documents into one. Basically this directive names a person(s) you trust who can make healthcare decisions should you be unable to do so. You are putting a lot of faith in this person to have your best wishes at heart, so choose wisely. There are too many medical situations that can arise for you to spell them all out in your living will. Therefore, this person will need to remain rational in a crisis and must not be easily intimidated by doctors. You might also want to name someone as an alternate should your first choice be unavailable. It doesn’t have to be a relative.
Do not confuse this document with a financial power of attorney – they are two separate things.
None of us want to think about death and dying, but if you don’t, your loved ones may be put in an awkward position at a time when they are too vulnerable to make a decision. Imagine your son, daughter, spouse, significant other or friend having to decide to pull the plug.
I’m not sure even I can do it!"

70,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/aging-7-ways-to-stay-active-with-arthritis/,"If you have arthritis, there may be days where you don’t feel like being active. But this just might make your arthritis pain feel worst and add to the pain problem. It is important to stay active with arthritis. Here are a few fun things we found on WebMD that you can do even with your arthritis:
- Start walking: walking keeps your joints flexible and your muscles strong. This low-impact, weight-bearing exercise is a good choice for people with arthritis.
- Carry your groceries: Make the most of your supermarket trip by carrying your groceries in the store and to your car. The weight adds intensity to walking and helps strengthen your upper body. Carry your bags across your arms to protect your hands. For an extra challenge, carry your bags up steps. Research suggests people who can carry groceries and climb stairs are less likely to have a stroke than those who can’t.
- Find fitness friends: Instead of planning lunch dates, suggest meeting friends for a brisk walk through the mall or a park. While you may be tempted to shrug off a solo workout, you will be less likely to stand up a friend.
- Volunteer: Help yourself and other people by taking on volunteer projects that benefit both mind and body. Consider walking dogs at the local animal shelter, planting trees, coaching a youth sports team, or building houses. Studies show that older adults who volunteer regularly have a greater sense of well-being than those who don’t.
- Play video games: If the weather is cruddy outside, stay indoors. Grab a gaming system but get off the couch. Research suggests some sports video games may burn as many calories as a brisk walk. In a study funded by Nintendo, the Wii Sports tennis, baseball, and boxing games all qualified as moderate-intense exercise. For joint flexibility and to improve your range of motion with arthritis, try your hand at balance games and yoga exercises.
- Clean your house. Don’t dread housework; it’s a way to avoid the gym. Cleaning the floor counts as moderate exercise because it raises your heart rate and makes you breathe faster. Other good exercise: washing windows, hanging laundry, and cleaning the bathroom. To protect your joints, alternate motions and the hands you use. Don’t overextend your reach, and bend with your knees to save your back. Consider knee pads for kneeling.
- Take a class: Like working out in a social setting? Sign up for a class. You’ll have a regular exercise time and place, plus a group of people who expect to see you. Remember, a fitness class doesn’t have to mean aerobics. Always wanted to learn karate or salsa dancing? Look for a class that will keep you coming back. Or join a walking group or masters swim team. Both walking and swimming are especially easy on the joints.

71,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/aging-and-mental-health/,"One in five older adults experience mental health concerns that are not a normal part of aging – the most common of which are anxiety or mood disorders including depression*.
Most mental health cases respond well to treatment, but unfortunately many older adults go do not get diagnosed and go untreated, which can lead to diminished functioning, substance abuse, poor quality of life, and increased mortality. Mental health is as important as physical health. Good mental health contributes to an overall feeling of well-being which impacts your stress levels, memory, sleepand how you think and feel about yourself. There are many way you can improve your mental health, here are three important activities:
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
Focus on your emotional and cognitive health with regular physical activity. While physical activity produces chemicals in the body that promote emotional well-being, inactivity can make depression, anxiety, and stress worse.
SOCIAL ACTIVITY
Focus on your emotional health by staying in touch with friends, family, and the greater community. Whether physically healthy or ill, people who feel connected to others are more likely to thrive than those who are socially isolated.
POSITIVE THINKING
Focus on positive thinking to help you live a longer, happier life. Positive thoughts can create real value in your life and help you reduce stress. Positive thinking and optimism on health can lower depression, improve coping skills during hardships and time of stress, and your psychological and physical well-being.
FirstLight Home Care Companion and Personal Care services are designed to support older adults and their families. We provide solutions to home situations that could be impacting the mental and physical well-being of an aging parent, like transportation. Our professional companion caregivers can provide transportation to get them out of the house and into a new environment. We transport our clients to appointments or help them with local errands and get them to social events and gatherings to keep them connected, active and engaged.

72,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/aging-and-staging-your-life-for-a-better-future/,"By: June Duncan, Guest Contributor
At a certain age, we all must accept that our bodies will weaken, our minds will wander, and someone will likely have to provide us care each day. But it’s what we do before that time that makes a difference in our end-of-life happiness.
Planning for the long road
Age brings with it the possibility for many health conditions that can’t be handled alone. According to Texas A&M, seniors experience a host of issues that affect physical and mental well-being. Sensory impairments, accidents, cognitive decline and even low self-esteem can negatively impact an individual’s ability to remain independent. Living alone, making unhealthy choices and family history all play a role in senior health. Education and income may also impact a person’s health — lower-income individuals are less likely to seek early treatment for developing health problems.
Some seniors find that enrolling in a Medicare Advantage plan can help. Some providers offer plans that give seniors access to wellness programs and dental and vision care. Also, many cognitive, mobility and visual impairments respond positively to minor home improvements. Added lighting throughout the house, a gradual incline ramp instead of stairs (installing an entrance ramp will likely run you $1,200 – $2,500), and senior monitoring may extend the ability to live alone safely. But these changes, along with wellness checks and support from family and friends, may not work as a long-term solution.
Paying for tomorrow
There are options to help cover the cost of long-term care. If you haven’t been able to save money, your assets are the first place you should look. For example, consider selling your home. Or if you’re not quite ready to sell and your home is paid for, renting it is an option that may help you cover the monthly cost of assisted living while keeping your heirs’ inheritance intact.
If you have a health savings account (HSA), this money will also come in handy when it’s time to receive in- or out-patient medical services. It is important to note, however, that upon Medicare eligibility, contributions to your HSA must cease. However, as SeniorLiving.com explains, the funds are still useable and may cover the cost of prescription medication and other medical expenses.
Beyond assets and savings, Medicare, Medicaid (or your state’s version of the latter), private health insurance and specialty insurance are also viable payment options. It’s important to note that while Medicare covers long-term hospital stays, it doesn’t provide extended coverage for a nursing home. If you are middle or high income, you will not qualify for subsidized coverage under most state or federal programs. Medicaid and most similar state insurance programs require an income of less than the current poverty level.
Ways to lower costs
Your health is something you can change. Short of dementia, cancer or severe trauma, lifestyle choices can enhance or damage your health and affect the cost of expected care. Here are a few ways to remain healthy longer:
- Stop smoking
- See your doctor for regular well visits
- Eat a balanced diet
- Avoid dangerous activities
- Remain socially active
Aging is expensive. But with planning and changes to your lifestyle, you may be able to save some of your hard-earned money — and preserve your health long enough — to enjoy the freedom that comes with reaching your golden years.
June Duncan has helped many family members and friends who have found themselves in a caregiving role. She enjoys writing articles on the subject, and hopes her experience caring for her aging mother will help others who are new to caregiving."
73,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/aging-live-well-happy/,"There’s no avoiding it. We’re all getting older. That doesn’t mean we have to feel like we’re getting older. There are many things you can do to impact the process of aging so that you will age well and be happy. Here are a few of our favorites.
Keep Your Cool. It is said that some levels of stress can be good for us. “If you never have to react to anything demanding, the mechanisms in your brain that help you deal with taxing situations will atrophy,” says Luigi Ferrucci, MD, PhD., scientific director of the National Institute on Aging. But, too much stress in your day-to-day life can negatively impact your quality of life.
Take a few good deep breaths and start to rethink how you react to the environment around you. Try to relax and even slow down. Our increasingly hectic daily lives can be stressful, but the impact of continuous stress on your body and mind can be harmful. Reports and studies from Psychology Today and Gerontology have found that adults who reported greater work stress in midlife were more likely to show disabilities and physical difficulties in older age. Start looking for solutions or change the way you allow these things to impact your life. If you’re overloaded at work, ask colleagues for help. If you can’t complete all your chores at home, divvy out the workload to others in your family (or us). If your time and energy spent on caregiving a family member or loved one has you working around the clock, look for a professional service to help you. Respite care is necessary for all caregivers.
Get Moving. Physical activities will help you feel good, look good, reduce stress, and improve your mood. Getting fit or staying fit as you move into your 40’s and 50’s will help you age well. The New York Times, in an article on aging and fitness, stated that those who were more physically fit in midlife were less likely to develop chronic health conditions in old age, such as congestive heart failure or Alzheimer’s disease.
Change the Way You Look at Aging. Stop looking at growing old in a negative light. Embrace your age and learn to accept the natural changes to our minds and bodies that will occur. Instead of dreading what’s ahead, look at getting older as an opportunity. Each day we have a chance to focus on what’s really important to us – our family, our friends, our spirituality, our pets, and or grandchildren. Being positive about you and your future will help you be healthier and happier as you age.
Get Out. Make plans with family or friends and go out. Becoming socially engaged is critical to staying healthy, both mentally and physically. There are lots of things to do you in your local community that you can do with friends or groups you belong to. By doing your homework, you’ll find many free activities or low-cost outings that can get you engaged. Not only will getting out help you connect to your family and friends…it’s your chance to make new ones too."

75,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/aging/,"This week, we promote the benefits of healthier, more active lifestyles. It’s Active Aging Week.
Eat right and exercise. We’ve heard this message all our lives. But for those over the age of 50, this message is even more important. Countless studies have proven that staying active and eating properly can help older adults achieve a higher quality of life, and it can help them live longer too.
Physical Activity and Aging
Maintaining an active lifestyle is crucial for sustaining health and happiness. Exercise can help older adults achieve a higher quality of life as they age. Seniors who avoid daily exercise can experience:
- Loss of muscle mass
- Decline in strength
- Increase in body fat
- Decline in bone density
- Loss of agility and balance
- Loss of endurance
Adding an exercise regime to your daily routine does not have to mean hours in the gym. You can often accomplish great things with just 30 minutes of activity per day! The positive effects of exercising each day for an elderly loved one include:
- Reduced risk of developing conditions and disabilities
- Lower blood pressure
- Increased balance
- Increased mobility
- Weight maintenance
- Increased flexibility
Good Nutrition and Aging
Smart food choices are part of healthy aging. Eating the right foods with the proper nutrients, while being mindful of the appropriate proportion sizes, is vital. As we age, our bodies can become less tolerant of certain foods. We tend to eat less. And our teeth and gums can change, making it difficult to chew certain fruits, vegetables or meats. These changes make it even more important for our elderly loved ones focus on good nutrition, including:
- Drink plenty of liquids. With age, you may lose some of your sense of thirst. Drink water often to stay hydrated. Limit beverages that have lots of added sugars.
- Eat your veggies: Include a variety of different colored vegetables at mealtime. Most vegetables are a low-calorie source of nutrients and a good source of fiber.
- Flavor up your meals: With age, our sense of smell and taste may change. Medicines can also influence how foods taste. A healthy way to add flavor to meals is with herbs and spices.
- Social eating: Eating alone can be depressing and can lead to a poor nutritional diet. Invite family, friends or neighbors to join you for lunch or dinner a few times a week.
Older adults generally need fewer calories. However, their nutrient needs are just as high or higher than when they were younger. It’s why doctors and nutritionists recommend that aging adults plan meals that focus on nutrient-rich whole foods, lots of vegetables, and plenty of liquids. For more advice, check out this helpful information and infographic the National Council on Aging has put together on 6 Ways to Eat Well as You Get Older.

Many military veterans and their family are unaware of the Aid & Attendance benefits program for which they could be eligible. The Veterans Aid & Attendance Pension is a little-known existing benefit which helps reduce the cost of care for older veterans and their surviving spouses.
Aid & Attendance is available to eligible veterans and spouses who require home care – including assistance with eating, bathing, and medication reminders – even if the assistance is not a direct result of a service-related injury.
The Aid & Attendance (A&A) increased monthly pension amount may be added to your monthly pension if you meet one of the following conditions:
- You require the aid of another person to perform personal functions required in everyday living, such as bathing, feeding, dressing and transferring; or you need help protecting yourself from the hazards of your daily environment – for example, if you have an increased risk for falls.
- You are bedridden, in that your disability or disabilities requires that you remain in bed apart from any prescribed course of convalescence or treatment.
- You are a patient in a nursing home due to mental or physical incapacity.
- Your eyesight is limited to a corrected 5/200 visual acuity or less in both eyes, or concentric contraction of the visual field to 5 degrees or less.
Veterans or the veteran’s surviving spouse could be eligible if the veteran:
- Was discharged from a branch of the United States Armed Forces under conditions that were not dishonorable
- Served 90 days of continuous military service (active duty), with at least one day during the following wartime periods (did not have to serve in combat):
- World War I: April 6, 1917, through November 11, 1918
- World War II: December 7, 1941, through December 31, 1946
- Korean War: June 27, 1950, through January 31, 1955
- Vietnam War: August 5, 1964 (February 28, 1961, for veterans who served “in country” before August 5, 1964), through May 7, 1975
- Persian Gulf War: August 2, 1990, through a date to be set by Presidential Proclamation or Law.
If the veteran entered active duty after September 7, 1980, generally he/she must have served at least 24 months or the full period for which called or ordered to active duty. However, there are exceptions to this rule.

77,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/alternatives-to-the-traditional-funeral/,"Guest blogger: Julie Grannan
My mom passed away on August 2, 1997. Only 54 years old, she had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer a short six months prior. Being “younger” I don’t believe that she and my dad had really discussed their funeral/burial preferences. But when terminal illness comes knocking on your door, this often times awkward conversation has to be had.
I was 18 years old at the time, and I remember being quite surprised and unsettled in my emotions when I heard that my mom wished to be cremated. However, over time and definitely as I fully entered into adulthood, I grew to understand, accept and appreciate her decision. A couple of years ago, I went to visit her tombstone where her ashes are buried. I hadn’t been there for many years as I lived away from where I grew up for 13 years. I was rather taken off guard because on the same tombstone my father’s name is next to hers. My dad (fortunately) is still alive, and so the dates for him read “November 12, 1940 – ______”. However, I didn’t remember that he had already had his name inscribed next to hers. The brutal reminder that one day I will also lose him was literally etched in stone. It hit me especially hard that afternoon.
With my dad almost being 72, the conversation of what he wants for his own funeral and burial will be one that has to be had as well. Bringing this up with your parents can be awkward and emotional. And for me now at age 37, my perspective on life and opinions on what’s “normal” have changed a lot since I was 18. My horizons have been broadened by time, travel and other cultures. I have begun to think more about my own mortality as well. How do I want my loved ones to celebrate my life? What do I want done with my body when my time is over?
I found a great article written by Susan Seliger on The New York Times’ The New Old Age blog. She discusses the topic of this blog post…alternatives to the traditional funeral. There are some great options for those of us who want to exit this world in possibly a more adventurous, less expensive, or even in more of a “green” fashion. Whether you are thinking of funeral arrangements for a loved one or yourself, I highly recommend you read her blog post!

78,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/always-be-prepared-what-to-do-when-a-natural-disaster-strikes/,"Did you know that September is National Preparedness Month? Being prepared for any type of emergency or natural disaster is important for everyone, but is especially important for seniors. Because each senior’s needs are different, it is essential that each individual have a unique emergency plan that fits all of your needs. If an emergency or disaster occurred today, would you be ready?
So, how can you prepare your loved one for an emergency?
1. Make an emergency kit
This kit should contain basic essentials like food, water, a flashlight, a battery-powered or hand crank radio and a first aid kit. When you are putting together the kit, make sure you think about the resources that your loved one uses on a daily basis and include those things. Since every individual has different needs, it is important that emergency kits are personalized.
2. Have an evacuation plan
The most important part of any evacuation plan is knowing who to contact. Before an emergency or natural disaster happens, make sure that your loved one knows exactly who to contact about getting out. When putting together an evacuation plan, talk the plan through with your loved ones to ensure that they know exactly what will happen.
3. Keep a supply of critical medicines on hand
If your loved one takes medicine or uses a medical treatment daily, it is extremely important that they have a supply of medication(s) available in case of an emergency because they may not have access to a drugstore or hospital. Also, if your loved one uses hearing aids or an electric wheelchair, be sure there are extra charged batteries around at all times.
4. Store valuable documents in easily accessible locations
In the event of an emergency or natural disaster, things will most likely be rushed. To make sure your loved one doesn’t forget anything important, advise them to keep copies of important documents somewhere that will be easily accessible. Important documents to include are:
- Family records
- Wills
- Social security cards
- Bank information
- Tax records
- Medical insurance and Medicare/Medicaid cards
- Contact information for family and loved ones
For seniors, preparedness is essential. Do you have an emergency plan in place for your loved one? If so, we’d love to hear your planning tips!"
79,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/alzheimers-awareness/,"This Tuesday marks World Alzheimer’s Day. With this important day right around the corner, we wanted to take some time to shed light on the topic. Consider this*:
• One in eight Americans aged 65 and older have Alzheimer’s
• 172 billion U.S. dollars are spent every year on the disease
• There are 10.9 million unpaid Americans acting as caregivers to Alzheimer’s patients
• Alzheimer’s was the seventh leading cause of death across all ages in the U.S. in 2006
Although Alzheimer’s affects people differently, some signs to be aware of in your loved one are: memory loss that disrupts daily life, challenges in planning or solving problems, difficulty completely familiar tasks at home, confusion with time or place, and trouble understanding visual images. Unfortunately, there is no treatment available to stop the deterioration of brain cells in Alzheimer’s disease. Yet the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved five drugs that temporarily slow worsening of symptoms for approximately six to 12 months.
So, how can you help? In addition to acting as a caregiver and providing emotional support, don’t be afraid to ask for outside help. Humor can also be a major coping mechanism. Depending on the condition of your loved one, find games that are fun for the both of you.
In hopes of making Alzheimer’s a national priority, awareness advocates have put together a bike ride called Alzheimer’s Breakthrough Ride. It will take place Sept. 21 in our nation’s capital. With a petition asking that the disease take nationwide precedence, the group will personally deliver the 100,000 signatures to Congress.
The group is encouraging others to sign the petition here and wear purple on Tuesday. You can also make a donation here to show your support.

80,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/alzheimers-disease-10-early-warning-signs/,"Memory loss that disrupts daily life may be an Alzheimer’s disease early warning sign or a symptom of another dementia. Alzheimer’s is a brain disease that causes a slow decline in memory, thinking and reasoning skills.
The disease is the only cause of death among the top 10 in America without a way to prevent, cure or even slow its progression. There are 10 Alzheimer’s disease early warning signs and symptoms that should not be ignored. People experiencing any one of these should see a healthcare professional.
This previous post [Know the 10 Signs of Alzheimer’s: Early Detection Matters], one of the most-read posts on our FirstLight blog, features a helpful infographic from the Alzheimer’s Association that explains these 10 signs. We thought it was worth re-posting.
Alzheimer’s disease early warning signs include:
- Memory loss that disrupts daily life
- Challenges in planning or solving problems
- Difficulty in completing familiar tasks
- Confusion with time or place
- Trouble understanding visual images or spatial relationships
- New problems with words in speaking or writing
- Misplacing things and losing the ability to retrace steps
- Decreased or poor judgment
- Withdrawal from work or social activities
- Changes in mood or personality
At FirstLight Home Care, we’ve developed dementia care plans to help people who are suffering from dementia or Alzheimer’s cope with the anxiety, depression, confusion and isolation that is often associated with the disease. Our unique, personal programs at home help not only the dementia sufferer but the family as a whole."
81,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/alzheimers-disease-caring-for-the-caregiver/,"June is Alzheimer’s & Brain Awareness Month. Worldwide, 47 million people are living with Alzheimer’s and other dementias and behind every person fighting this disease is a family member and caregiver battling it too. We know you’ve got questions. You’re scared and worried about what is going to happen next. This isn’t healthy. Caregivers and family members living alongside a person with Alzheimer’s need to care for themselves too. It’s not easy but it must be done for you to maintain your own health. We asked our FirstLight Home Care Caregivers to give us their best tools to help maintain a healthy environment for caregivers around the world. Here’s what they had to say:
Manage Stress. Stress does really bad things to our brain, especially the hippocampus. It’s an essential brain structure as far as learning and memory and it’s the first structure that starts to show problems with dementia. Watching a family member struggle with memory loss can be stressful. Stress management involves a multitude of tools but one approach that can be helpful to dementia caregivers is taking advantage of support services and respite care so they can get a chance to recharge their batteries.
Be Active. Regular physical activity has a protective effect. Moderate daily activities such as swimming, walking and group cardio classes are ideal activities to help you lower your risk for Alzheimer’s and help rejuvenate the caregiver’s spirit.
Ask for Help. This is harder than most people think. Some caregivers fear it is a sign of weakness, when in truth it actually shows your strength. We all have limits and when you ask others to step in and help you, you in turn will be stronger. Build a support system for you and for the person living with Alzheimer’s and you both will benefit from your support groups.
Plan for the Future. When someone in your family is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, you need to start getting his/her health, legal, and financial affairs in order. By getting these as organized as possible, it will be extremely helpful as the disease progresses. You should make sure you have the following documents and that they are up to date: Durable Power of Attorney for Finances and for Health Care, Living Will, Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) form, Will, and Living Trust.
If you have questions about in-home care for family members living with Alzheimer’s disease, respite care services, or you would like to learn more about local support groups in your area, please reach out and ask our own Nurse Gina."
82,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/alzheimers-finding-a-cure/,"More than 6 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease. Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia in the world and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States.
It is projected that by 2050, the number of people living with the disease will rise to nearly 13 million as baby boomers continue to age and people are living longer overall. In fact, over the past decade, the average life expectancy has dramatically increased around the world. In the 1950s, the average global life expectancy was estimated to be 47 years. As of 2020, the global average life expectancy is 73 years, with the trend expected to grow to 77 years by 2050.
Although the risk of Alzheimer’s disease increases with age, it is not a normal part of aging or something that should be expected in older people. We still have no cure for Alzheimer’s and it seems that our progress on developing medications and treatments for the disease has hit a standstill."
83,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/am-i-facing-caregiver-burnout/,"It’s well-documented that caregivers often suffer from emotional and physical health problems because of their overwhelming caregiving duties. According to the Mayo Clinic, caregiver stress is common. In fact, one in three American adults cares for a family member, and this figure is sure to rise.
As a caregiver, you might not realize you’re facing caregiver burnout, but friends and family are often the first ones to notice that your behavior is different. Luckily, these folks can be your greatest supporters during the caregiving journey. Here are three factors that may indicate you’re facing caregiver burnout.
You have a short fuse
When we try to do too much and are feeling overwhelmed, we often lash out at those around us. If you find yourself being grumpy or snippy, having a short fuse or getting easily frustrated with people and life, you may be experiencing caregiver overload.
To combat this behavior, take a deep breath and count to 10 before reacting to any situation. Those 10 seconds can give you a much-needed mental health break, and it’s a great way to start a meditation practice. Imagining you are in a happy place and breathing intentionally could help you be better prepared to handle stressful situations with grace.
You are withdrawing from social gatherings
If you are feeling that you just don’t have the energy or desire to attend family gatherings or meet up with friends, you may be experiencing caregiver burnout. Caregivers often take on way more responsibilities than they can handle, leaving them feeling that they have no time for themselves. This can lead to feelings of sadness and even depression.
Self-care is not selfish. Your loved one may need you, but you also need to be healthy and happy to be the best caregiver you can be. That does not mean you have to be “on” 24/7. Take time for yourself by asking friends and family to take over caregiving duties one day a week, so you can attend an exercise class, take a hike, get a massage, read a book or just sleep in. The little things matter to caregivers and any help is appreciated.
You are getting sick more often and not fully recovering
Burnout results in a lowered immune system, making you a target for illness. According to Health Central, long-term caregiving can shorten your life by about eight years. That’s a sobering statistic and one that needs to change. If you find yourself getting sick a lot or never fully feeling 100%, you may need to take some time off to regroup.
The best caregiver is a healthy caregiver. If you are sick, you can’t fully care for your loved one. And being sick around an older adult can pose a threat to them too. It’s common for caregivers to put their loved ones above themselves, but that is a slippery slope and can backfire.
Caregiving is not for the faint of heart. It’s hard work and can be a rollercoaster of emotions. But you can handle it with a little self-care, and a little help from your friends and family.

84,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/andy-rooneys-thoughts-on-aging-agree/,"Andy Rooney was an American radio and television writer. He was best known for his weekly broadcast “A Few Minutes with Andy Rooney” a part of the CBS News program 60 Minutes. His segment typically offered satire on trivial everyday issues that many found entertaining. While scouring through articles Mr. Rooney wrote, here is one of our favorites from 2005.
“As I grow in age, I value women who are over forty most of all. Here are just a few reasons why: A woman over forty will never wake you in the middle of the night to ask, What are you thinking? She doesn’t care what you think.
If a woman over forty doesn’t want to watch the game, she doesn’t sit around whining about it. She does something she wants to do. And, it’s usually something more interesting.
A woman over forty knows herself well enough to be assured in who she is, what she is, what she wants and from whom. Few women past the age of forty give a hoot what you might think about her or what she’s doing.
Women over forty are dignified. They seldom have a screaming match with you at the opera or in the middle of an expensive restaurant. Of course, if you deserve it, they won’t hesitate to shoot you, if they think they can get away with it.
Older women are generous with praise, often undeserved. They know what it’s like to be unappreciated.
A woman over forty has the self-assurance to introduce you to her women friends. A younger woman with a man will often ignore even her best friend because she doesn’t trust the guy with other women. Women over forty couldn’t care less if you’re attracted to her friends because she knows her friends won’t betray her.
Women get psychic as they age. You never have to confess your sins to a woman over forty. They always know.
A woman over forty looks good wearing bright red lipstick. This is not true of younger women. Once you get past a wrinkle or two, a woman over forty is far sexier than her younger counterpart.
Older women are forthright and honest. They’ll tell you right off if you are a jerk, if you are acting like one! You don’t ever have to wonder where you stand with her.
Yes, we praise women over forty for a multitude of reasons. Unfortunately, it’s not reciprocal. For every stunning, smart, well-coiffed hot woman of forty-plus, there is a bald, paunchy relic in yellow pants making a fool of himself with some twenty-two-year-old waitress.
Ladies, I apologize.
For all those men who say, ‘Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free,’ here’s an update for you. Now 80 percent of women are against marriage, why? Because women realize it’s not worth buying an entire pig, just to get a little sausage.”"
85,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/another-end-of-the-spectrum/,"It just occurred to me you might be wondering how I ended up with foster parents. Well, first let me say these two wonderful individuals were friends of my parents. When I was 12 years old my mother died from a massive stroke and they immediately made arrangements to take me in due to my father’s chronic and poor health. He died the following year with heart failure. Other family members were not in a situation where they could care for me so my foster parents became Mom and Dad. That has been many years ago and I continue to feel blessed today.
Now back to Jule. She is amazing and I am serious when I say I need to call to schedule an appointment to see her because she is so busy. Her week consists of 3 days doing water aerobics at the YMCA, volunteering at the hospital reception desk 4 days a week, as long as it does not snow too much. Her sense of humor is definitely intact. This year one day she called me to tell me how she and her car slid down the hill from the hospital to the eye doctors appointment she had that day, which happened to be at the bottom of the hill, and then she laughed – hard. She continues playing cards with her club, going out to dinner and is ready whenever anyone says, “Let’s go”. During the winter months I either take her bags of books or she goes to the library when the weather allows. Her love of reading must have rubbed off on me.
I must tell you, this is a woman who has been a caregiver all of her life. She had two older children of her own when she took me in, cared for a mentally disabled sister, an aging uncle and somewhat difficult aunt. She worked part time doing everything from being a beautician to a receptionist at a real estate office to working in the kitchen at the school. At different times, especially when my dad’s company, GE, went on strike she would work full time while he found other work so he did not have to cross the dangerous picket lines. We never went hungry or without but certainly did not take extravagant vacations or have a lot of extras. They made sure there was money put aside for us kids to further our education. Jule has had her share of personal heart aches as well with her son falling ill with juvenile diabetes and subsequently dying from the disease at the age of 44 following a nasty divorce, the loss of a grandchild to leukemia, her son in law dying from kidney disease and eventually losing her husband to bone cancer. Last year when she got pneumonia and came home on oxygen I called her to find that she was not wearing it and was mopping her kitchen floor. She told me I was not to be mad at her because she was feeling just fine. This is when I began thinking about a personal response system or some in- home companion care but she didn’t feel ready for it, yet.
She has been a rock and believes things happen for a reason; I must have gotten that from her as well. Our entire family feels blessed that she remains in good health and wants to live independently. The last time I visited was the first time I noticed a change. Actually, she brought it up and said that many of her friends were dying. I think the recent loss of her good friend Betty hit her hard because she told me she missed her terribly and that they “shared secrets”. The normal spark had left her eyes and I felt a loss as well. We all know the tough conversations about driving and living alone are coming but for the time being she is happy living in her own home and feel confident we know where to find the best options when the time is right for her to have some help."

87,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/are-you-a-heart-attack-waiting-to-happen/,"Too often we ignore the warning signs of a heart attack, thinking it might be indigestion or the strain of a muscle. That’s why heart attacks are nicknamed “the silent killer”, because rarely do they just happen suddenly. Usually there are a number of warning signs that should never be ignored.
More than a million Americans have a heart attack every year, and chronic heart disease is the leading killer of both men and women in the United States. A heart attack, or a myocardial infarction (MI) causes permanent damage to the heart muscle. Oxygen rich blood stops flowing to the heart muscle, the heart muscle becomes blocked, and the muscle begins to die. The good news is that excellent heart attack treatments are available, particularly when started right after the symptoms occur. Even if you’re not sure if you or someone you love is having a heart attack, call 9-1-1 right away. It could mean the difference between life, death, or living with a permanent disability.
Most heart attacks occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD), also called coronary artery disease. CHD occurs when a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries, blocking the ability of oxygen-rich blood getting to your heart.
The Warning Signs of Having A Heart Attack
The symptoms signs of a heart attack include:
- Chest discomfort. You may feel discomfort in the center of your chest, arm or below the breastbone that may come and go.
- Shortness of breath with or without pain
- Breaking out in a cold sweat
- Extreme fatigue
- Nausea and vomiting
- Light-headedness
The symptoms of a heart attack will be different for each person. Some people don’t even realize they are having a heart attack. If you’ve already had one heart attack, your symptoms could even be different the second time around.
More men than women have heart attacks, but this gap is rapidly closing. Unfortunately for women who have a heart attack, they are more likely to pass away, be permanently disabled or have a second heart attack within a year. Why? Because the signs of a heart attack in females can be slightly different for women than men. Many women suffer from extreme fatigue, frequent indigestion, and lack of strength versus chest pains.
Preventative Test Could Save Your Life
When was the last time you had a complete physical? Or even a stress test or EKG to make sure your heart’s arteries are not blocked? I can hear you say it: “it’s too expensive”. Or, “I don’t have insurance.” The average cost of a heart attack is $760,000 in hospital costs alone, so in comparison, these tests are relatively inexpensive!
However, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or high blood glucose can all be risk factors that can make you a heart attack waiting to happen. Some of these tests are inexpensive or many communities have them available with free health screenings. Here are some tests recommended by Prevention that could literally save your life.
- Stress tests which measure your pulse and heart rate as you walk on a treadmill hooked up to an EKG. Unfortunately, this test is not very accurate, often misdiagnosing women with false positives.
- Cardiac calcium scoring via a CT scan that checks for atherosclerotic plaque in your heart’s arteries.
- Carotid Intimal Medial Thickness Test which takes an ultrasound of your neck to measure the thickness of the left and right arteries supplying blood to your brain and heart.
- High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein Test which measures the protein in your blood indicating inflammation throughout your body.
- Advanced Lipid Profile Test is a cholesterol blood test that goes beyond the traditional cholesterol test looking at the size of the cholesterol particles that can triple your chances of a heart attack.
- A1C Blood Glucose Test measures your average level of blood sugar over the prior 3 months to detect your future risk of diabetes.
Don’t wait too long before getting help. More people could survive heart attacks or diminish their recovery time if they got help faster.
If you need help recovering from a heart attack, a FirstLight Home Care caregiver can be at your home every day, to help you with medication reminders, bathing, dressing and anything else you need to help speed up your recovery time."
88,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/are-you-physically-able-to-be-your-parents-caregiver/,"I stumbled upon an article today on the Maturity Matters blog that raised a very poignant question: Are you physically able to be your parents’ caregiver? With the boomer population rapidly increasing and the desire to age in place greater than ever, it’s no surprise many of us will inevitably start taking care of our parents. As anyone in the home care industry can attest, the job of caregiver is — albeit filled with love — also a frustrating, exhausting, emotional, sometimes boring and often lonely experience. What can caregivers do to keep themselves in shape for this kind of work? Blogger Stan Cohen says it’s important to step back and ask yourself the following questions:
• Do you stretch at night and morning to loosen up?
• Are you exercising to burn off the stress that can have a negative impact on your body?
• Do you follow a diet or nutritional guidelines to ensure your system stays healthy and functions properly?
• Do you drink enough fluids and keep hydrated throughout the day?
Cohen encourages future caregivers to take a step back and assess the tasks and responsibilities involved in caring for an elderly parent and how to best prepare.
If you find you might not be able to undertake all the responsibilities due to your own physical health reasons, enlisting the services of a professional caregiver like the ones offered through FirstLight, is a great way to ensure your elderly loved one’s safety."
89,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/are-your-aging-parents-behaving-badly/,"There are many stresses that people deal with as caregivers for their aging parents, but few are as difficult to handle as aggressive and negative behavior. At FirstLight
HomeCare, we receive countless questions and concerns about what to do with an
aging parent who is abusive and hard to control. The problem that many people face is the difficulty in confronting their parents about these behaviors saying things like, “they are stuck in their ways” or “they will get defensive if I bring up their behavior.” Although these concerns are valid, you can and should address your aging parents behavior since it is for their safety as well as your own.
Whether your aging parents are physically abusive, curse excessively, or take poor care of themselves, there are simple and effective ways to help them change their behavior. In order to assist in this difficult endeavor, we have provided a brief guide on how to address your parents behavior in a manner that is beneficial to both parties.
Discuss in a private and comfortable setting
When you address your parents poor behavior, they will inevitably become uncomfortable and/or aggravated. By discussing these behavioral issues in a private, comfortable setting, you will help alleviate some of this discomfort they will have and create an environment that they won’t try to leave.
It’s also best to be the only person in the room with them during this conversation in order to avoid embarrassing them, especially if you have siblings that have the same concerns as you. If your aging parent feels bombarded, they will think only of leaving the situation and not receive the message you want to get across. Furthermore, a safe and comfortable environment will help your parents open up and discuss their behaviors with you. This will ultimately create the most beneficial discussion that can lead to real change.
Be Assertive in Explaining Their Poor Behavior
Don’t sugarcoat your concerns about their poor behavior as this will make them believe their behavior isn’t as bad as you see it. By being assertive about their poor behavior,
you will display the necessity of why they need to change. This will lead to them believing that they actually do need to change. Let them know what they need to improve and how their behavior is affecting not only you, but their lives as well.
Give Specific Examples of Poor Behavior from the Past
If you generalize your message you will only confuse your parent and give them an opportunity to blow your concerns off as misjudgment on your part. Specific examples will let them see what they are doing wrong and how their behavior has affected those around them and themselves. This is especially true for general behavioral traits like cursing or physical abuse since they might not remember ever doing them. If you provide your parent a specific instance that they hit you or cursed excessively they will be able to relate to that moment and see how their behavior causes harm. Simply stating that they curse or hit will lead them to believe that you are exaggerating or overreacting.
Explain Why Their Behavior Needs to Be Changed
Even with your concern, your parents may not recognize why their behavior is bad and how it affects themselves and those around them. Explain how their behavior makes you feel and how it negatively affects their health and safety. A clear explanation will help show them why a specific behavior is bad and will give them a reason to change. Few people of any age will change something just because someone else tells them to; however, if you are able to see how your behavior affects those around you, you will be more willing to change.
Reward Change, But Don’t Bribe Them
When your aging parent begins to show positive change in their behavior, let them know that you are happy with their improvement and encourage them to continue on the right path. However, it is not recommended to bribe them as it will make your concern come off as cheap and less important than you wish. They will only see through these bribes and
lose trust in you and your concerns.
Final Note
Remember that your parents are aging and that their behavioral changes might be related to medical complications. If you are concerned that their bad behavior might be related to a medical issue, speak with their physician and discuss alternative methods to making sure your parents are healthy and safe."
90,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/art-aging-art-can-benefit-older-adults/,"Older adults need to exercise their brain and their body.
According to the Journal of the American Medical Association have found with older adults that exercising the brain is as important to keep the brain alert and strong as physical exercise is to keep the body strong and able.The benefits of movement, building, inventing or creating things is fulfilling, and it gives people a sense of worth and contribution while helping them to maintain a positive outlook on life.
In the book Successful Aging, John W. Rowe, MD, and Robert L. Kahn, PhD, discuss three aspects of successful aging: low risk of disease; high mental and physical functioning; and being actively engaged in life. Expressive art activities can help promote active engagement in life. And art keeps older adults engaged in life in positive, healthy and fulfilling ways.
Art has a positive effect on health and illness as we age. It can serve as therapy by offering an outlet for an older adult to express themselves, and it assists individuals in tapping into and expressing their imagination and creativity. The benefits of many art forms, including dance, writing, pottery, painting, poetry, knitting, woodworking and crafting, have the following positive results in older adults:
- helping individuals relax
- providing a sense of control
- reducing depression and anxiety
- assisting in socialization
- encouraging playfulness and a sense of humor
- improving cognition
- offering sensory stimulation
- fostering a stronger sense of identity
- increasing self-esteem
- nurturing spirituality
- reducing boredom
As we age, cognitive and physical exercise are imperative not only to our health, but to our overall life expectancy.
If older adults are experiencing frustrations with the age-related decline in his or her physical abilities, creative arts programs can provide them with an outlet for expressing their feelings in a positive way. Participatory creative arts programs also can lead to an increased sense of well-being, as well as decreased rates of psychological issues such as depression.

The following checklist will help you prepare yourself – and them – for the season.
- Schedule pre-winter heating maintenance. Before you crank up the heat, schedule regular maintenance for heating systems to confirm they’re in good working order. If your loved one’s home includes a fireplace, be sure to also have chimneys inspected and cleaned to prevent dangers like flue fires.
- Control the internal temperature. Now is the time to adjust automatic thermostats to account for the season’s fluctuations in temperature.
- Get ready for fall fashion. Don’t put the lighter clothing in moth balls just yet, but be sure to have sweaters and jackets at the ready. Layering is the name of the game throughout autumn. Be mindful of footwear, as well. Non-skid boots and shoes with plenty of traction can help prevent slips and falls in wet or frosty weather.
- Prepare for ice and snow.In cooler regions, it’s not unusual to get a preview of the cold, snowy and icy winter weather during the autumn months. Be sure to make shovels, car brushes and salt accessible in the event of an early storm.
- Ward off seasonal illnesses.* The frequency and severity of sicknesses escalates as the year comes to a close. Hand washing is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of fall illness. The Centers for Disease Control recommends washing hands with soap and clean, running water for 20 seconds. Wet, lather, scrub, rinse and dry. Older adults can also help boost immunity through good hydration, which can benefit the immune system during cold and flu season.
- Take advantage of the harvest. Many healthy – and delicious – fruits and vegetables are center stage this time of year. Adding seasonal produce such as beets, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, sweet potato, pumpkin, apples, cranberries, eggplant and kale can help manage diabetes, contribute to heart health and promote a healthy immune system.
- Beware of falling leaves. While colorful leaves are part of the beauty of autumn in many regions, they can present a safety hazard. When wet, they can become slippery and pose a fall risk. And piles of leaves can hide potentially dangerous obstacles. Be sure to remove them regularly from porches, sidewalks and key walkways for older adults.
- Be sure you can detect danger. Fall is one of the critical times of the year for checking smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. Change the batteries in these devices, and test them to make sure they’re in good working order.

94,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/autumn-safety-checklist/,"This autumn safety checklist can help you prepare your aging senior for the season.
The weather is getting cooler, the days shorter and the air crisper. As we adjust to this “season of change,” it’s a perfect time to consider the safety, health and wellness of older adults who are aging in place. And planning for the change in seasons is particularly important for older adults who are living alone. Read this autumn safety checklist to help you and your loved one prepare.
Before you turn up the heat, schedule regular maintenance for the home’s heating system to confirm it’s in good working order. If your loved one’s home includes a fireplace, be sure to also have chimneys inspected and cleaned to prevent dangers such as flue fires.
Conduct a home safety check. There are many things you can do to make your loved one’s home safer so that they may age in place. Some are simple things, and some may include slight home modifications.
- Pick up items on the floor that your loved one could trip over, including unnecessary clutter.
- Consider moving anything that is plugged in to a different area of the home if cords become a tripping hazard.
- Add secure railings to both sides of stairs, inside and out.
- Make sure there is enough light on the interior and exterior of the home by adding additional lighting or brighter bulbs.
- Add grab bars inside and outside the tub or shower, as well as next to the toilet. Also consider adding a shower chair or hand-held shower.
Clean up the leaves. While colorful leaves are part of the beauty of autumn in many regions, they can present a safety hazard. When wet, they can become slippery and pose a fall risk. And piles of leaves can hide potentially dangerous obstacles. Be sure to remove them regularly from porches, sidewalks and key walkways for older adults.
Prepare for ice and snow. In cooler regions, it’s not unusual to get a preview of the cold, snowy winter weather during the autumn months. So, have shovels and salt handy in the event of an early storm. If your parent or grandparent is still driving, make sure their car is in good working condition, including keeping fluids topped off, scheduling necessary maintenance, making sure tires have plenty of air, and ensuring the headlights and taillights are working properly.
Have those layers on hand. Be sure to have sweaters and jackets at the ready. Layering is the name of the game throughout autumn. Be mindful of footwear, as well. Non-skid boots and shoes with plenty of traction can help prevent slips and falls in wet or frosty weather.
Discuss driving at night. Daylight Saving Time ends on the first Sunday in November, which is November 4th this year. This means it will start to get dark earlier. Driving after dark also means reduced visibility. Make sure your loved one is comfortable with driving at night. If they are not, make sure they get to where they need to be before the sun goes down.
Get a flu shot. The frequency and severity of sicknesses escalate as the year ends. The flu vaccine is especially important for older adults who are more susceptible to catching the flu virus.
Be diligent with everyday healthy habits. Hand washing is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of fall illnesses. The Centers for Disease Control recommends washing hands with soap and clean, running water for 20 seconds. Wet, lather, scrub, rinse and dry. Older adults can also help boost immunity through good hydration and by getting plenty of sleep, which can both benefit the immune system during cold and flu season.
Take advantage of the fall harvest. Many healthy and delicious fruits and vegetables are center stage this time of year. Adding seasonal produce such as beets, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, sweet potato, pumpkin, apples, cranberries, eggplant and kale can help manage diabetes, contribute to heart health and promote a healthy immune system.
We hope the fall season sticks around for a while, but we know that winter will be here before we know it. In addition to this autumn safety checklist, check out these tips for helping seniors stay safe this winter.

95,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/avoid-sibling-caregiver-conflict/,"In November, we celebrate National Home Care and Family Caregivers Month, two observances that are core to FirstLight Home Care. Throughout the month, our FirstLight blog will focus on providing the tools, tips, resources and peace of mind so many family caregivers need. We invite you to comment and share the challenges and rewarding experiences you’ve encountered throughout your caregiving journey.
How to Avoid Sibling Caregiver Conflict
If not kept in check, sibling caregiver conflict can damage family relationships
When it comes to caring for the needs of an aging parent, it can be helpful to share caregiving responsibilities with your siblings. However, brothers and sisters often disagree on many of the common decisions that are involved in a loved one’s care. These can include anything related to money, family possessions, healthcare decisions and your parent’s living arrangements.
These disagreements tend to not only upset your loved one, but they also can cause sibling conflict and damage relationships. There are ways to help avoid sibling caregiver conflict. Read below for tips and advice, and remember – always let your loved one’s health, comfort, safety and quality of life be your guide.
Common sources of sibling caregiver conflict
Disagreements can arise about many things when it comes to caregiving:
- Money. Disputes over finances are one of the biggest sibling caregiver conflicts that occur when caring for a parent, including how money should be spent, which sibling pays for what, who manages the finances if your parent is no longer able and inheritance.
- Freedom and safety. What if it’s time to approach Mom or Dad about giving up the car keys? Who will do that if necessary? Who will ensure that the home is safe if your parent is living alone?
- Living arrangements. There can be a difference of opinion when it comes to where Mom or Dad should live. Are they able to remain in their home own with some assistance? Would an assisted living community make more sense? Or do they need the skilled care of a nursing home?
- Caregiving decisions. Perhaps you need to hire a professional caregiver. If so, who manages the hiring of that person? Who will provide meals or make sure your parent keeps their doctor appointments? What about a system to ensure your loved one is taking his or her medication?
- Medical decisions. Determining which sibling should make those often-complex decisions about treatment and end of life care can be challenging, especially when you are not on the same page about the best course of action.
- Parent possessions. Discussions over who gets what personal possessions when a parent downsizes or moves – or even after a death – frequently arise and can cause major battles between siblings.
Here is what you can focus on to help avoid conflict:
Involve your parent in the decision-making. Ask your parent what they want and be willing to compromise if necessary. There may be more than one solution to your parent’s day-to-day care needs -that will also meet the needs of your siblings – while keeping your parent healthy, safe and happy.
Divide and conquer. Try to split caregiving tasks based on your siblings’ strengths, as well as their schedule and availability, and then create a care plan. There may be one sibling who works full time and only has availability during the evening hours. Perhaps one has more flexibility during the day and can help with cooking and cleaning. Sharing the duties also ensures that no one person is carrying the entire load.
Talk to each other. Open communication is key. Discuss each family member’s role and responsibilities in the caregiving process upfront, and continue to keep everyone updated on what is happening with your parent. Check in regularly and listen to each other, especially if someone is feeling alone, exhausted or frustrated. Be empathetic to your siblings’ circumstances. You are all in this together!
Consider bringing in outside help. Caregiving is sometimes harder than it seems. And it can put a strain on family relationships – with both your parent and your siblings. Even if you think you can manage it all, sometimes the best solution is to hire a caregiver that can relieve some of the burden and allow you to be son or daughter, brother or sister.
Whether it is illness, injury, dementia or just challenges that come with old age, FirstLight can help you or your loved one. Our caregivers take on the tasks that can seem overwhelming, but we also understand that what you want most for your loved one is help, hope, comfort, companionship and compassion.

96,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/avoid-spreading-flu-germs/,"Flu season is here (darn it). The single best way to avoid the flu is to get an annual flu vaccine and then hide in your home until flu season is over. Okay, that isn’t very practical. The flu is spread mainly from person to person in droplets that fly out when you cough or sneeze. These tiny drops from a sick person move through the air and land on the mouths or noses of others nearby. Germs are also passed along when you touch these droplets from someone else on a surface like a desk and then touch your own eyes, mouth, or nose before you get a chance to wash your hands. Viruses like the flu can live 2 hours or longer on surfaces like cafeteria tables, doorknobs, and desks. We might not be able to avoid being exposed to flu germs, but we can certainly take actions to prevent the spread of germs.
Here are some everyday steps that may help you lower your chances of getting or spreading the flu:
- Wash your hands often with soap and warm water. If soap and water aren’t available, use a hand sanitizer. Choose a sanitizer that is at least 60 percent alcohol.
- Avoid contact with colleagues, friends, or family members if you or they have the flu or a cold.
- Try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
- Disinfect surfaces at home or work, especially when someone is sick.
- Stay home. An adult can infect other people one day before symptoms show up and up to 5 days after they start.
- Cover your nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, preferably using the crook of your arm.

97,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/avoid-these-5-mistakes-when-caring-for-your-aging-parents/,"Approximately 34.2 million Americans have provided unpaid care to an adult age 50 or older in the last 12 months [National Alliance for Caregiving, 2019]. Every day a new family caregiver becomes part of this large group of people dealing head-on with the tasks of helping their parents with daily living: personal hygiene, dressing, food preparation, walking and mobility, transportation, housekeeping, medication management and more.
If you are the family caregiver – whether you’re new to the role or not – we have compiled some advice to help you avoid 5 common mistakes when caring for your aging parents.
Mistake #1: Not getting their life (and yours) in order. Gather pertinent legal, financial and personal information and place everything in one folder in case you need it in an emergency or unexpected situation, including:
- Bank and investment accounts
- Estate documents like wills and trusts
- Funeral and burial plans
- Medical and insurance information
- Names and phone numbers of professional advisers
- Real estate documents
Mistake #2: Not asking for help: Caring for your elderly parents is tough. It can involve daily assistance with bathing, dressing, eating, cleaning the house and doing minor repairs. It can include laundry, shopping for groceries, preparing meals, transportation to and from doctor appointments, and more. This list is just a portion of the responsibilities a family caregiver may have, and it is a lot for one person to handle. Don’t be shy. Ask other family members to step in and help. Family caregivers often feel guilty about asking for help. However, the stress and strain from ongoing caregiving responsibilities can impact their health and the ability to provide the care their loved one needs.
Mistake #3: Not being hands-on with their medical care: Many new family caregivers have never had to navigate the healthcare system before. As a caregiver, you’re going to have to become more proactive about your loved one’s medical treatments and be an advocate for their well-being.
- Copy and store all your loved one’s relevant medical information in a notebook and bring it to every doctor appointment.
- Take notes and keep a record of what is being recommended at each appointment.
- Keep an up-to-date medication list.
- Learn as much as you can about the medical conditions of your loved one.
As your parent ages, their condition may change, and you may not be able to provide everything they need. Knowing what other resources are available in your local community, and what it takes to get them more advanced medical care, should be a long-term priority.
Mistake #4: Not taking care of the caregiver: When a member of the family decides to be the primary caregiver to their parents, it’s easy to forget that he or she needs time for her own personal activities and family…not to mention their own health! The extended family should ensure that the caregiver gets enough time off to rest and recharge. If other family members can’t step in to help, you can hire a professional caregiver. Everyone needs respite care to have short-term relief from their caregiving responsibilities, whether it’s for a few hours one afternoon or for several days.
Mistake # 5: Not planning for the realities that lie ahead: End-of-life care is something that few people like to think about, let alone discuss. It is a mistake to avoid the subject and it can have devasting consequences for the entire family if the topic is ignored. At a minimum, you should do the following:
- Call a family meeting when your parents are still healthy.
- Help your parents pull together all the necessary legal and financial documents into one location
- Name an executor or a personal representative to ensure that all wishes are carried out as written.
- Name beneficiaries to receive the property. A will should specify who receives specific “gifts of property,” or specific bequests, which include real estate, cash, and personal property.
- Specify what personal assets should be divided among beneficiaries; these need to be detailed in a will.
- Address all debts, expenses, and taxes. It’s helpful to include how final expenses are to be handled, such as funeral costs or inheritance and estate tax.
- Discuss any special instructions. This can include things like how one’s home should be maintained and cared for to arrange for someone to care for pets.

98,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/avoiding-caregiver-burnout-when-dealing-with-alzheimers/,"Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s is a tough job. The stress, demand, and constant worry can take a heavy toll on the family caregiver, so much that they often don’t take good care of themselves. It can also be an emotional journey as the family member providing care watches their loved one’s memories disappear and their daily skills decline. This inevitably will lead to caregiver burnout.
Caregiving for someone with Alzheimer’s or another form of dementia can be all-consuming. Family caregivers face many responsibilities and it is easy to become overwhelmed. The best advice our caregivers at FirstLight Home Care have is to understand and implement self-care as part of your caregiving role and use the resources you may have at your disposal to get the support you need.
Here are 8 tips to help you avoid caregiver burnout when dealing with Alzheimer’s:
- Learn about the disease. Become an educated caregiver. Learn about the disease and ask your loved one’s doctors as many questions as possible to better understand Alzheimer’s, how it will change over time, and what impact it will have on you and the care you’re providing.
- Set realistic caring expectations. You will not be able to do everything for the loved one in your care. Define what you can realistically do and then find other people or outside resources to help with the other caregiving duties in which you need support.
- Know what community resources are available and use them. Most communities have adult day programs, in-home care support or assistance, meal delivery services and/or caregiver support groups to help you.
- Pay attention to your stress levels. If you experience signs of stress on a regular basis, consult your doctor. Other signs of burnout can include extreme fatigue, lack of energy, anxiety, depression, social withdrawal or lack of interest in the things you used to enjoy. Ignoring these symptoms can cause your physical and mental health to decline.
- Ask for help. It’s okay to ask friends, family or professional caregivers to help with some of the caregiving tasks. It takes a village to care for someone with Alzheimer’s.
- Take breaks. Time for yourself is very important. Make respite care a priority so you can spend time doing something you enjoy. Respite care provides caregivers with a temporary rest from caregiving, while the person with Alzheimer’s disease continues to receive care in a safe environment. Learn more about FirstLight Home Care’s Respite Care services.
- Get moving. Physical activity can help reduce stress and improve your overall well-being. Even 10 minutes of exercise a day can help.
- Get your legal and financial situation in order. Organize your loved one’s legal and financial plans to ensure everything is in one place and in order. If you are unsure about how to complete legal documents or make financial plans, you may want to seek assistance from an attorney specializing in elder law, a financial advisor who is familiar with an elder or long-term care planning, or both.

99,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/baby-boomer-trends/,"The Baby Boomer generation are pretty cool. There are 40 million Americans age 65 and older and they make up 13 percent of the population. By 2030, when all the baby boomers will have passed age 65, this group will represent over 20 percent of the population. What’s fascinating is that they continue to make a difference in our world. Here are some trends that show just how Baby Boomers are making an impact!
1. Helping Young People: Baby Boomers are going back to the classroom to support local schools. With funding reduced in area schools, many Boomers are joining forces and going into the classrooms to support teachers by reading to students, tutoring and mentoring the next generation.
2. Starting a Businesses: Boomers, especially women, are starting their second career. They are starting a new businesses, becoming coaches and consultants and turning their passion into the job they have always wanted. At FirstLight Home Care we’ve seen this first hand. The number of Baby Boomers seeking to own a franchise business that serves and cares for the elderly is on the rise. The need to help is a core philosophy of this generation and what we do fits perfectly in how they want to make a difference in the lives of families.
3. Traveling: Baby Boomers are out in high numbers seeing the world. They have worked hard for years and it is now time to take advantage of the money they’ve saved and travel – both domestically and abroad.
4. Volunteering: Boomers are volunteering from the ball fields and concert halls, to feeding the hungry and gathering goods for the men and women in our military. They are out in large numbers making a difference and giving back.
5. Still Working: Many Boomers do not want to retire. They are still working and plan to do so for many years to come. Stats from About Careers state that 55% of Boomers want to keep working to maintain their independence and to continue to benefit from the financial opportunities in their selected field.
Baby Boomers, whether still working, retired or semi-retired still feel the need and desire to make an impact on their local communities and the world they live in.

100,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/be-positively-happy/,"Happiness begets happiness. When we think positive thoughts, we lessen stress, increase our coping skills and reduce the risk of depression and cardiovascular disease. Everyone likes being happy, but it’s not always easy to get there. To start on your path to happiness and positivity, follow these tips:
Surround yourself with positive people and things. Toxic relationships will make you unhappy. Take count of all the meaningful relationships in your life and work on nourishing them, then distance yourself from relationships that cultivate negativity. Make your home a place that relaxes and inspires you; fill your space with things that you love and de-clutter the things that don’t serve you.
Smile, even when there’s not a specific reason. Smile at people, smile at yourself, smile at children and dogs. Smiles are contagious!
Be present. You can worry about things that have already happened and stress about things in your future, but really it’s what’s happening now that matters. Sometimes when we worry about the past or the future, we forget to enjoy our present lives.
Forgive yourself. There’s no better way to be unhappy than to place blame on yourself. Forgive yourself and try to be better next time.
Do something nice. Doing something for others makes us feel good. Help out a neighbor, make dinner for family or volunteer your time with an organization you believe in.
Move around. Take a walk in the park, go for a bike ride or take an exercise class. Just getting up and moving will make you feel better.
Do something you love once a day. It could be for five minutes or a couple hours, but make sure you spend at least part of your day doing something that makes you truly happy.
Identify any unhappiness in your life. Once you know exactly what’s preventing you from being happy, you can start to work toward changing that thing. Also identify the things that make you the happiest and try to include more of that in your life."

Why is that? Research from Psychology Today has found that making your resolutions work will involve changing behaviors—and in order to change a behavior, you have to change your thinking (or “rewire” your brain). This takes work. We have to set specific, measurable, time-bound goals and keep them front and center. If you are one of the millions of people in the United States compelled to make a New Year’s resolution, here are some helpful tips from Ray Williams of Wired for Success, to help you make them work**.
- Focus on one resolution, rather than several and set realistic, specific goals. Losing weight is not a specific goal. Losing 10 pounds in 90 days would be a better goal.
- Don’t wait until New Year’s Eve to make resolutions. Make it a year long process, every day.
- Take small steps. Many people quit because the goal is too big, requiring too much effort and action all at once.
- Have an accountability buddy, someone close to you to whom you have to report.
- Celebrate your success between milestones. Don’t wait for the goal to be finally completed.
- Focus your thinking on new behaviors and thought patterns. You have to create new neural pathways in your brain to change habits.
- Focus on the present. What’s the one thing you can do today, right now, toward your goal?
- Be mindful. Become physically, emotionally and mentally aware of your inner state as each external event happens, moment-by-moment, rather than living in the past or future.
Achieving your New Year’s resolution goal should be a process and you should enjoy the ride throughout the new year. Do you set New Year’s resolutions? If so, what’s your goal? If not, why not? Join the conversation over on our Facebook page.

102,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/become-a-professional-caregiver/,"If you’re a family caregiver, it’s a role you likely never expected to have. However, more than one in five Americans are caregivers just like you – helping a sick or aging family members. So, you’re certainly not alone. While the experience can be challenging and emotional, many family caregivers find it rewarding as well. If you’re one of them and would like to turn your abilities and experience into a career as a professional caregiver, FirstLight® Home Care can help.
We offer a range of professional caregiving opportunities for individuals like you who want a meaningful career. Some of these positions include:
- Home Health Aides
- CNAs
- Care Coordinators
- Companion Care and Personal Care Assistants
Even if you’ve never worked professionally as a caregiver, we’ll train you thoroughly and match you with clients who are an ideal fit.
At FirstLight Home Care, we are always looking to hire those who want to enrich the lives of others. If this sounds like something you’re interested in, here are some of the ways you’ll be able to help other families as a professional caregiver.
Our Professional Caregivers Provide Respite Care
One of the primary ways our caregivers help families is through respite care. Perhaps, in the past, you had a caregiver who provided you and your family with relief so you could step away for a bit while knowing your loved one was in capable hands.
As a professional caregiver, you can be that person for another family, offering their loved one practical assistance at home, as well as emotional and social support to improve their quality of life.
Our Professional Caregivers Provide Personal Care
When a loved one requires help with bathing and dressing, as well as personal hygiene, you may know from personal experience that it can be awkward for a family caregiver to handle these needs.
When you’re providing care at a professional level, you’ll be able to help an individual, whether they’re elderly, disabled or recovering, to ensure they’re safe and comfortable. You can also assist those with mobility issues, whether it’s going up and down stairs, getting into or out of bed or moving around the home. Meanwhile, you’ll give their family peace of mind knowing you’re watching closely and can help whenever needed.
Our Professional Caregivers Provide Companion Care
Family caregivers are often focused on the physical needs of their loved one. Yet, those who are older or disabled need social and emotional support too. Some of the ways our professional caregivers provide this support are through sitting and talking with their clients, assisting with getting out of the house to shop, eat out, or visit with friends, or participating in recreational activities. When you work at FirstLight Home Care, you’ll be providing this kind of companion care to an individual, so they have a trusted confidant and friend to turn to.
Our Professional Caregivers Provide Specialized Care
If an individual has dementia or Alzheimer’s, it requires a compassionate, knowledgeable and dedicated person to care for them. If you’ve cared for your own loved one with these or other chronic, debilitating conditions, then you know it’s a painful journey. However, you may also know that the right caregiver can make a world of difference in the life of the individual and their whole family.
Professional Caregiver Jobs at FirstLight Home Care: We’re Hiring!
Whether you’re currently caring for a loved one or have in the past, a career as a professional care provider can help you put your skills and experience to use. You’ll be able to offer individuals the kindness and respect you’d want for your loved one. At the same time, you can make their life easier by helping around the house in many ways – such as with meal preparation and light housekeeping – all while ensuring they’re safe and comfortable.
It takes a special kind of person to be a caregiver. If you are or have been a family caregiver and would like to build a career in this field, FirstLight Home Care offers rewarding and meaningful jobs as a professional caregiver. We also provide the industry’s best training, so you feel comfortable and confident walking into that first client’s home.
In addition, our culture is one that values our caregivers. We believe deeply in client happiness, as well as caregiver satisfaction. It’s why we offer a fun and engaging culture in which to work, one that offers competitive pay and opportunities for advancement.

103,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/being-a-long-distance-caregiver/,"Caring for aging parents can be difficult, and when you live thousands of miles away, it can come with a whole new set of complications. How do I make sure they are cared for properly? How will I respond to (or even know about) medical emergencies? How will I know if they pay their bills on time? These questions can eat away at you each day, and worse yet, you can’t visit them whenever you wish to calm your fears. If you are worried about your parents well being far away, read our tips below to calm these fears and provide the best support you can from far away.
You Are Not Alone
If you are a child of an aging parent that lives thousands of miles from your parents, the first thing you need to know is that you are not alone. Nearly 7 million Americans today
are caring for aging parents that live far from home, each dealing with the same fears and complications that you are dealing with today. Once you realize that there are people in
your own community going through the same circumstances, you should feel less
isolated and guilty for being far away. Reach out to people in your personal life who might help you deal with being a long distance caregiver.
Get Help from People in Their Neighborhood
One of the easiest ways to calm your fears about your parents well being far from home is to know that people in their neighborhood and community are looking out for them. These community members don’t necessarily have to check up on them every day, but it will calm your fears to know that they are keeping an eye out for them. If something does go wrong, they can contact you sooner than the authorities would. If your parents attend church or any other community activities, make it known to the group that you are caring for them from a distance and would like for them to keep an extra eye out for you. Community and church groups will be more than happy to help their fellow patrons and their families. A great time to ask community members for assistance is wen you visit your parents. This will give a more personal touch that will make them want to help you all the more.
See if Family Nearby Can Help
Getting help from your parents’ neighbors and community members is a great way to calm your worries. However, if there are any family members that live close to your parents, ask them if it would be okay for them to check in on occasion. Family will be more comfortable reporting any issues that might arise to you, and they can be more reliable than your parents’ neighbors. Don’t be afraid to ask family to help even if you feel like it might be a burden. Family is there to help, and no matter how little they can check in on your parents, you will feel much better knowing someone close to you is there if any problems arise.
Know Your Parents Medical Situation
Knowing your parents medical situation is a great way to calm your fears. By knowing who their doctor is, what medications they are taking, and when they go in for visits, you will be able to track their health more closely. Let their doctor know that you are caring for them from another state and would like to be informed and updated if any medical issues arise.
Make Your Visits Count
When you do visit your parents, make sure their house is safe and comfortable. Make sure to take care of all possible danger areas, including locks, alarm systems, and tripping
hazards. Being unsure of whether or not your parents are safe in their own house when you live far away can be very unsettling, and by double checking all these precautions, you can ease your fears.
Be Careful of Moving Your Parents Into Your Home
Be careful about moving your parents to your current home simply because you are worried about them living so far away. Most aging parents are comfortable with their
home, their routine, and their community, and the adjustment to a new environment can be much worse than letting them live in their own home far away from you. If you feel it necessary to move them to your home, make sure to have a lengthy discussion with your parents to ensure they are comfortable with the transition.
Stay in touch
More often than not, simply staying in touch is the most important thing you can do. There is no need to jump on an airplane every time you have a worry about your parents. By keeping in touch, you can calm the daily fears you are having about their well being. Furthermore, you will know about any developing issues before they get too serious. This way you can be prepared for a medical crisis if it arises in the future. Sometimes the best thing you can do for your parents is to just talk to."

Whether you need elderly companion care services, senior care services, or 24-hour care for a loved one who is elderly, chronically ill, recovering from surgery, or living with a disability, there are overall happiness and quality of life benefits, for the entire family, when adding a companion care provider to your day-to-day life:
- A companion care provider can handle daily needs: such as light cleaning, bathing, and keeping seniors, veterans and adults with disabilities safe from harm.
- They can ensure that all medication is taken on time and that your loved ones adhere to their specific treatment plans.
- They can focus on your loved one’s nutritional needs. They can do everything from the grocery shopping and meal planning to meal preparation and cleanup.
- They can provide social interaction and keep your family member or loved one engaged while at home or out at a social event or special occasion.
- They can provide respite care for you or the main caregiver so that they can have a break from their caregiving responsibilities. This break allows the family caregiver to regroup, refresh, and take care of their own personal needs.
- They can help you or your family member get out and about. Companion care providers can drive your loved ones to the grocery store, library, health club, an appointment, or to meet up with their friends.
- They can help your elderly parent, veteran, or adult living with a disability to live and feel independent while giving you peace of mind.
Companion care needs are not always as obvious as personal care needs like bathing and hygiene. It’s about creating a true connection to help you, or your family member live a happier and healthier life. Having someone around can have a positive effect on your mental health. Companionship can make all the difference in the world to someone living alone or perhaps caring for a loved one. From sharing a conversation to sharing a meal, companion care offers emotional support and friendship to people who don’t necessarily require medical services.

105,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/benefits-of-seniors-walking/,"We all know we should exercise, but we have a million excuses why we don’t. There’s not enough time. Your aches and pains prevent it. The weather outside doesn’t permit it. It’s important to get moving and stay moving no matter how old you are.
However, did you know that to burn off one plain M&M candy, a person would need to walk the entire length of a football field?
That inactivity is the second leading cause of preventable death in the U.S., second only to tobacco use?
Walking is the most popular form of exercise in the United States. Why? Because it’s the easiest. You can walk anywhere. If the weather is bad, you can always go to the mall and walk. It doesn’t require any special equipment nor do you have to go to a gym.
So say goodbye to the couch and let’s hit the pavement! Your heart and body will thank you!
Before you decide to overdo it, here’s some tips to make sure you get the full benefits of exercising:
- Start out slow. If you’ve been sedentary for some years, you need to start out moderately. Otherwise you’ll fall, hurt yourself, and never start up again. Start with a 5-minute walk and work your way up to 45 – 60 minutes. Swing your arms if possible so your arms get the benefits too.
- Join the video craze. Think video games are just for kids? Think again! Wii has some great workout games targeted specifically for seniors.
- Keep your posture. Make sure your head is up, eyes forward so you don’t look at the ground and trip! Make sure your gait is as smooth as possible – heel to toe.
- Alternate easy days and hard. You don’t have to work out seven days a week – aim for five. One day you could walk for 30 minutes and the next day for 60. Or walk for 30 minutes and lift light weights for 10 or 15 minutes. The key is to get your heart pumping!
- Choose an exercise that’s fun. Maybe you don’t enjoy walking. You can always try swimming, golfing or tennis or virtually any activity that keeps you motivated. Did you know that April 26 is National Dance Day? You’re never too old to cut a rug!
What Are The Benefits of Walking?
According to Mayo Clinic and The American Heart Association, the following are the benefits of walking:
- Lose weight, trim your waistline or maintain a healthy weight
- Prevent heart disease, stroke, asthma, cancer, Type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure
- Strengthen your bones
- Release hormones that make you happier
- Improve your balance and coordination
- Improve your blood lipid profile
- Reduce your risk of osteoporosis and dementia
- Reduce your risk of breast and colon cancer
- Boosts your Vitamin D Levels
- Gives you energy
Before you start any exercise program, check with your doctor. Combine a healthy diet with an exercise program and you’ll have a double win!
Here’s another fun fact. Did you know if you walked nonstop, it would take a year to walk around the world? Also, a 2000 study reported that walking regularly (three times or more a week for half an hour or more) saves $330 a year in health care costs. You can save your health and save money at the same time.

106,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/benefits-of-walking/,"I have long ago passed the point in my life where I can jog. Two ACL surgeries have left my arthritic knees unable to take the impact. I don’t live anywhere near a swimming pool and I am too hyperactive to do yoga. Spin classes give me a headache just thinking about it. And because I am a work-a-holic who works out of my house, I need to get out and about for my own sanity and the sanity of my family.
I have a million excuses NOT to exercise. “I’m too busy” is my favorite. “It’s too hot outside” is my next. My most ridiculous one is “I need a new pair of walking shoes”. Considering my old ones only have 10 miles on them, I can hardly justify the expense.
The benefits of walking have long been touted by the experts. In fact, a study at the University of Tennessee found that women who walk have lower body fat than women who don’t. That should come as no surprise. Most women my age have a pesky 10 pounds they’d like to shed.
What are the other benefits of walking?
- Reduces the risk of blood clots
- Improves circulation
- Lowers blood pressure
- Strengthens the heart
- Stops the loss of bone mass
- Leads to weight loss
- Strengthens muscles
- Improves sleep
- Slows mental decline
- Slows Alzheimer’s onset
- Improves your balance and coordination.
Here’s the one that really cinched it for me: A research study at the University of Michigan Medical School and the Veterans Administration found that those who exercise regularly in their fifties and sixties are 35% less likely to die over the next eight years than their non-walking counterparts.
Yikes. If I don’t exercise, I might as well start writing my eulogy. I want to make sure I am around to see my kids get married. I’d like to teach my grandkids to love books as much as I do. And I’d love to retire, choosing to do what I want each day versus having to work to pay the bills.
Okay, okay. I’m going to start out slowly … half a mile a day and work my way to two miles. I’m going to start out three days a week and work my way to four. I don’t want to fail, so I have to be realistic about my goals. I’ll never be able to exercise 7 days a week!

107,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/best-foods-to-support-memory/,"Are you feeling forgetful lately? Don’t worry, you’re not alone. There are many things that could be impacting what you recall. Pressures from work and home life, sleeping patterns and not allowing time in your day to do some form of exercise may be impacting your memory. However, did you know that your memory is impacted by the foods you’re not eating as well? Next time you’re at the grocery store, fill your cart with these tasty items.
Blueberries: This tasty fruit has been shown in numerous studies to do wonderful things for memory and the brain in general. Blueberries contain anthocyanin, a known memory-boosting phytochemical. They also contain many other phytochemicals that may contribute to healthy brain function.
Omega-3: The majority of the cell structure in the brain consists of healthy fats, including the most important healthy fats, called Omega-3 fatty acids. As the brain continues to fix itself and grow additional neurons, it needs a good amount of Omega-3s to be consumed. Best sources of Omega-3 include: salmon, albacore tuna, flaxseed oil, canola oil, eggs and walnuts.
Water: Your body is made mostly of water. It’s very easy to go all day without consuming the necessary quantity of water and become dehydrated. Even a mild case of dehydration can reduce your mental energy and capacity, causing your memory to become impaired. You should drink at least four liters of water each day, or six to eight 8-ounce glasses.
Fiber: Technically fiber in itself might not be considered ‘food’, but you often get it through foods. Consuming a fiber-rich diet will slow down digestion and gradually release the sugar into your bloodstream. Foods that contain a good dose of fiber include: dried fruits, veggies like broccoli, green peas, and spinach, peas and beans, nuts and seeds, whole fruits like avocadoes, kiwi, and pears and finally whole wheat grains.
Stress, not enough sleep, lack of exercise, and diet can impact your memory. Let’s start today to work towards a better you. Are you with us?

Mother’s Day is a holiday that it is observed in many different forms throughout the world. According to History.com, the American incarnation of Mother’s Day was created by Anna Jarvis in 1908 and became an official U.S. holiday in 1914.
In honor of the holiday, we asked our FirstLight family to share their best Mother’s Day advice. We’ve included a sampling here, along with a sprinkling of inspirational quotes. Enjoy! And please comment here on this post or on our Facebook page if you’d like to share your own advice.
Raising teenagers is not an easy task, and one not to take on without knowing what you’re in for! I have two girls, one 16 and the other 12 (going on 18). I found myself in a rather exhausting disagreement with my oldest and happened to bring up the subject to a close friend who had “been there, done that” while raising two of her own. I will never forget the simple but powerful advice my friend gave me that day:
She said, “Choose your battles and chose them wisely.” At first, this was hard to do, but with time it became as easy as walking. I have to say, it improved my relationship with my girls and I am truly thankful for those words of advice that I will pass down to my girls when they become a mother too one day…in the distant future.

“Mothers are like glue. Even when you can’t see them, they’re still holding the family together.” —Susan Gale
Be a good listener. And always look in the mirror before you leave home.
- Raelene Plummer, Owner/Manager, FirstLight Home Care of Northwest Arkansas
“A mother’s arms are more comforting than anyone else’s.” —Princess Diana
My mom, who was a special ed teacher and school librarian, used to say the people who are the hardest to love need it the most. I didn’t really get it until I had kids of my own and realized how true this is with my own kids on the days they are most challenging to parent. I found it to be true in life and in this business. Often, the clients and families who most test us ultimately are the ones who just need a little extra tender loving care.

“Motherhood is the exquisite inconvenience of being another person’s everything.” —Unknown
Not from my mother but from my grandmother…You can’t let everything get to you when your spouse (or really anyone because this applies to all relationships) gets on your nerves or you have disagreements. You need to let it just roll off your back like water off a duck’s back.

If you have aging parents or are neighbors to an elderly couple and you are going to give them something for the holidays, maybe you’re not sure. May we suggest the following gift ideas?
- Create a coupon book. Make a fun, personalized coupon book with services to help them care for them home. For example: One Free Snow Removal of Driveway, Walkway, and Sidewalk. Or, a coupon for a free ride to the grocery store. Or, free raking of their leaves.
- Handmade is all the rage. If you have creative, sewing, or cooking skills, use them this holiday season to create something special and just for them.
- Give them your time. Take them to dinner or make them dinner. Put down all the devices and distractions and “be present”. That would be the best gift of all.
- Parents with hearing issues: You may want to consider giving them an amplified telephone that has an adjustable volume control, hearing aid compatibility, and a powerful speaker.
- Headset for listening to the TV: If your parents have the volume up on their TV and you’re trying to talk to someone else – it can be difficult. Get them a headset that will allow them to adjust the volume and tone desired without disturbing other people in the room.
- Magnifier for parent who have vision issues: No, we’re not talking about them looking like Sherlock Holmes. Magnifiers and/or penlights are way more sophisticated. They come in a wide variety of brands and types and are available for TV magnifying, lamp magnifying, and pocket magnifying to help them read small labels and print.
Whatever you plan or give this holiday season we know it is going to be something special."
110,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/bill-gates-invests-alzheimers-dementia-research/,"Could This Investment Spur Major Breakthroughs in Alzheimer’s and Dementia Research?
Last week we learned of some exciting news in the area of Alzheimer’s and dementia research.
Bill Gates announced a personal investment of $50 million in the Dementia Discovery Fund—a private fund working to diversify the clinical pipeline and identify new targets for treatment. This news could potentially impact anyone who has been or will be affected by Alzheimer’s or related dementias, as well as help accelerate Alzheimer’s and dementia research.
Everyday Firstlight Home Care works with patients who suffer from many different forms of dementia. We see firsthand the effect this disease has on families, their loved ones and the caregivers providing care. We sat down with our own CEO, Jeff Bevis, to get his take on this news. Here’s what he had to say:
“We see the rapid rate in which people are being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s or some other form of dementia. And because many people with dementia wish to remain in their homes for as long as possible, the need for dementia care services continues to increase across the United States.
I applaud Bill Gates’ personal investment to help accelerate this great work to combat Alzheimer’s. And I absolutely agree with his areas to target for greater progress in research and development. He called out these five areas where improvements are needed:
- A better understanding of how Alzheimer’s unfolds, including a better handle on its underlying causes and biology.
- Earlier detection and diagnosis of the disease.
- More approaches to stopping the disease.
- Easier methods for getting people enrolled in clinical trials.
- Better use of the data that is compiled so that researchers can look for patterns and identify new routes for treatment.
Bill Gates is making this investment on his own to ‘support the brilliant minds doing this work’. I am optimistic that by adding his interest, his investment and his personal family experience to this effort, it will make a significant impact on progress and bring us a brighter future faster.”

111,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/blaze-a-trail-during-older-americans-month/,"For the older individuals in your life, whether they’re your parents, family or close friends, it’s important to recognize their contributions to our nation and our way of life. Because of their trailblazing attitude and efforts, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Community Living has deemed May to be Older Americans Month.
For us, senior care isn’t just a profession, it’s a culture of care that extends to older individuals from all walks of life. We thrive off giving back to our elders and want to help you celebrate everything the older individuals in your life have to offer. Here are a few ways you can “blaze a trail” during Older Americans Month:
- Be healthful: Because the theme for Older Americans Month 2016 is “Blaze a Trail,” it’s wise to help your older loved ones make an impact longer and healthier. Encourage them to be active with low impact exercises such as walking, Tai Chi, yoga or swimming. Even hobbies like gardening can help older individuals stay active longer.
- Be engaged: One in four older Americans make a positive impact by engaging in volunteer activities. If the older people in your life are looking for ways to engage with their community on a social and civic level, encourage them to try volunteering with an area election commission or non-profit organization.
- Be creative: Chronicling the wisdom of older Americans is a great way to improve upon our futures, so help your loved ones be a little more creative and put their experiences on paper or on a computer. This can be through painting, journaling, poetry, or song lyrics, and don’t just let them do it on their own. Lend a helping hand and be creative yourself – you may inspire them to blaze another trail all on their own.
By engaging with the older men and women in our lives, we can become much more aware of the issues they face every day. Preserving everything they have to offer is also important for our future generations to learn and grow, something our senior caregivers know very well. The caregivers at FirstLight Home Care are available to help with activities and to drive enhanced quality of life for the seniors that we work with. To learn more about how our culture of care helps blaze trails for our clients, contact your local FirstLight Home Care today to learn more."
112,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/bone-health-tip-eat-for-your-bones/,"When it comes to building strong/healthy bones there are two key nutrients: calcium and vitamin D. Calcium supports your bones and teeth structure, while vitamin D improves calcium absorption and bone growth. Here are some great foods to help you build strong bones.
- Yogurt: One cup of yogurt can be a creamy way to get your daily calcium. Yogurt is fortified with vitamin D.
- Milk: Eight ounces of fat-free milk will cost you 90 calories, but will provide you with 30% of your daily dose of calcium.
- Cheese: Just 1.5 ounces of cheddar cheese contains more than 30% of your daily value of calcium.
- Sardine: You either love these little fish or not, but cans of sardines have surprisingly high levels of both vitamin D and calcium.
- Eggs: They contain a small (6%) of your daily vitamin D, they’re a quick and easy way to get it.
- Salmon: known for having plenty of heart-healthy omega 3 fatty acids, a 3-ounce piece of sockeye salmon contains more than 100% of your vitamin D.

114,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/bring-light-to-the-holidays-how-to-avoid-a-blue-holiday-season/,"Many people look forward to the holiday season. This is a time of year that is often associated with holiday traditions, spending time with family friends, eating delicious food, going to holiday parties and enjoying the beautiful winter weather.
However, this can be a hard time of the year for seniors. They may feel nostalgic or lonely or depressed during the holiday months. As the holidays approach, they can begin to become upset about health issues, the loss of loved ones over the past year or their inability to travel to see family this year. The holiday blues can affect anyone, leading to increased feelings of loneliness and depression.
But, there are a few ways to help seniors beat the holiday blues. How can seniors avoid a blue holiday season this year?
- Listen to holiday music.
Just listening to holiday music can help to lift your mood. If you’re feeling adventurous, go out caroling around your neighborhood, attend a holiday concert or a community holiday sing-along.
- Bake holiday treats.
Is there one cookie or sweet that instantly reminds you of the holiday season? Bake some of your favorite cookies, cakes, breads and treats to get you in mood for the holidays. Baking them can be just as fun as eating them afterwards!
- Send holiday cards.
Holiday cards can be a great way for you to stay connected with family and friends that live far away. Go through your address book and send cards to new friends, old friends and all those in between.
- Get out and see some holiday lights.
The holidays are the perfect time for a walk or drive around the neighborhood (depending on weather) to see the holiday light displays. Each house looks a little different and it’s always fun to see how the owners chose to decorate each year.
- Watch a holiday movie.
This time of year is a great time to watch television. It seems like every channel has some kind of holiday movie on, whether it’s a classic like It’s a Wonderful Life or a new favorite like The Polar Express. Tune in and you’re sure to catch a holiday movie or two each day.
- Share your favorite holiday memories.
When you’re spending time with your family or friends, take some time to share your favorite holiday memories from the years passed. This can even be done on the phone, over Skype or through email. Reminiscing about your favorite memories from the holidays is always a good way to make your day a little brighter."
115,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/building-a-winning-team-against-cancer/,"Today, we welcome our first guest post from caregiving expert, author and speaker, Joni Aldrich. Here is Joni’s advice on how to build a winning team against cancer:
The reality is that 4,000 people are diagnosed with cancer every day in the United States. To put that in perspective, that’s the population of my hometown in North Carolina. When these patients and their families hear the words “you have cancer”, they feel exactly the way my husband, Gordon, and I did seven years ago. We didn’t know what to do. The Saving of Gordon: Lifelines to W-I-N Against Cancer contains the knowledge that I wanted on the day that Gordon was diagnosed. The book is full of best methods to fight any war against cancer.
Where do I recommend that families start when they hear those words that will change their life? They should focus on building a winning team. Chapter Eight in The Saving compares building a winning cancer team to building a winning football team. That may sound odd, but the building blocks are essentially the same.
“The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don’t play together, the club won’t be worth a dime.”
—BABE RUTH
Good backers. The insurance companies are your backers. Health insurance is one of those variables that can be across the board from nonexistent to over-coverage. While you have to work somewhat within their confines, you also have to look out for your best interests. Find your assets within the insurance and health care system. If you don’t have health insurance, there are still options available to you.
An impressive stadium. This will be your treatment facility. A lot of cancer patients choose one close to home because it’s easier. If you built a stadium in a location that’s convenient and not because it’s the best location to get fans to the games, would you succeed? Mistakes in finding the right treatment center cost more than just valuable time and strength. Location, location, location!
The right equipment. Facilities have different medical equipment. There’s a big difference between a facility with a high annual caseload treating your type of cancer, and one that doesn’t treat many cases at all. If something goes wrong, the facility has to have the equipment and know how to deal with it quickly and efficiently.
A great coach and staff. This is your primary oncologist and his or her support staff, which will likely include several types of doctors. You may have a different oncologist for radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery. Your coach (primary oncologist) will design the “plays” to coordinate your cancer war. Confidence, experience, and success—these are critical factors to look for in your primary oncologist.
A good team. If you have carefully chosen the facility and oncologist, the rest of the team should be equally qualified. It will include physician assistants, nurses, medical techs, therapists, clinicians, pharmacists, and other highly trained individuals. Your comfort should be provided for throughout your treatments. An occasional stumble in service might occur (cancer centers are busy places!), but it shouldn’t be the daily normal.
Know your opponent. How aggressive is your opponent? What are their strengths and weaknesses? How well do you know everything there is to know about your cancer? Is it isolated, or has it spread? Are there new treatment options or clinical trials? Knowledge is the key to success for you and your team! Ask for copies of all medical test results.
A strategic playbook. This will be the cancer regimen that you and your oncologist decide on. It shouldn’t be wishy-washy or poorly defined. The playbook has to be flexible to accommodate the differences in the other team (the cancer) and what’s working offensively and defensively. The entire team has to understand the playbook.
Officials that are for your team. The officials in a cancer battle are the caregivers. Most cancer patients need a primary caregiver. They focus on the patient’s side, and may need to blow the whistle. They don’t actively take part in the game, but it couldn’t be played without them. The caregiver has to make certain that all details are covered with the medical staff. One detail that you may feel is insignificant could result in a turning point where you don’t want to go.
Fans to fill the stadium. Your fans will support you, lend you encouragement, and offer prayers. They will be there to give you a kind word or help at home. They make and receive calls, sometimes at odd hours. The support they give is available no matter where you are, or what you’re going through.
Understanding the goal. Make sure that your team understands the goal and what you expect from them. While each goal must be attainable, no one said that a low-ranked team couldn’t make it to the Super Bowl. It’s happened before. Work daily to make the impossible possible.
How important is a winning team? Even though Gordon’s first treatment facility and oncologist were part of a highly accredited teaching hospital, they didn’t know how to treat his type of cancer. Medical tests that were done—but not acknowledged—showed that Gordon’s cancer was very aggressive. After five months of standard treatment, the cancer was three times worse than before any treatment at all. We were suddenly thrust into an urgent life-or-death struggle to save Gordon. It was too late, and we lost him two years to the day after he was diagnosed.
About Joni’s cancer books (available at www.basketofcare.com):
The Saving of Gordon: Lifelines to W-I-N Against Cancer
Based on Joni’s experience and years of research, this inspirational and informative book is designed to give families a fighting chance in their own cancer battle.
Connecting through Compassion: Guidance for Family and Friends of a Brain Cancer Patient: When Gordon’s cancer metastasized to his brain, Joni needed advice on how to reconnect to her husband of 20 years. This book contains it—too late for Joni, but to help other families caring for a brain cancer patient."
116,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/called-to-support-the-family-caregiver/,"In November, we celebrate National Home Care and Family Caregivers Month, observances that are central to FirstLight Home Care. Throughout the month, our FirstLight weekly blog will focus on providing the tips, resources, peace of mind and inspiration that so many family caregivers need. If you are or have been a family caregiver, we invite you to comment and share your rewarding experiences caring for a loved one, as well as the struggles you have faced throughout your caregiving journey.
The family caregiver – a person who provides regular physical, emotional or household support to a loved one who is elderly, disabled, ill or recovering – has become a mainstay in the United States.
More than 40 million Americans provide care for a loved one who needs assistance. On average, family caregivers spend more than 24 hours per week providing care. And that’s just scratching the surface. The overall impact of caregiving responsibilities on families is profound.
Each November, we observe National Home Care Month and National Family Caregivers Month. It’s easy to see why an entire month is set aside to recognize the importance of home care and the role of the family caregiver. It’s fitting that these two observances are celebrated simultaneously each year. Home care providers and family caregivers have a truly meaningful relationship.
Throughout the month of November – and always – FirstLight Home Care honors the individuals who take on the labor of love that is family caregiving.
You are humble heroes. And we champion you!
Are you a family caregiver? What does being a caregiver mean to you?

It has been a long winter for her; she has been in the hospital several times with urinary tract infections, pneumonia, dehydration and this last admission was because she became weak, unconscious and fell. With the resulting gash on her head, multiple bruises and right arm in a sling, she looks like she just lost a fight. All of this kept her recovering between the hospital, rehabilitation unit and our homes.
Her memory is lessening; her paranoia is worse. She asked her daughter, Carol, if today was the day we were going to kill her. This breaks my heart, aggravates Carol and upsets her son and my husband Harry. As you might remember, on most days at home, Harry and her son-in-law Kermit (yes, that is his real name) take care of Martha. The problem is now she does not clean herself well after using the bathroom, hence the urinary tract infections, she cannot take a shower alone and has become more difficult in general. This is where the family quagmire begins.
Martha has six children; five boys and a girl; so we know who is in charge, right? Three of them live out of state; two are disabled veterans so the caregiving falls to the two children who live close where there is someone home full time. Unfortunately, family members disagree and not just in this family. Several believe Martha would be better taken care of in a nursing home with a specialized unit for dementia. Another set believes she is not in that bad of shape and we should be able to take care of her ourselves. Now, admittedly the common concern over money plays into these opinions. Martha inherited some money from two of her sisters that did not have any children several years ago. At the time she was not showing any signs of Alzheimer’s disease and went so far as to purchase her first home at the age of 80.
So we now find ourselves in more of a conflict resolution and basic mediation mode. As the medical professional in the family I personally am working to improve my communication skills to be a more effective mediator. Part of this involves learning re-framing, laundering, I-statements, paraphrasing, purpose-stating, preference-stating, agreement stating, matching, summarizing, validation and any other techniques I can find to reduce the family chaos. Conflict comes in many forms so I am learning to analyze the situation and then work to deal with the different personalities in order to find a common ground. One key is to understand a variation of the Golden Rule which is respecting one another as you would have them respect you. Calming the storms so people can communicate more effectively has been a challenge and I have had to repeatedly use paraphrasing to insure the person’s point of view is accurately represented. One example is where my brother-in-law wants to repeatedly tell his mother, Martha, that she has Alzheimer’s and expects her to “snap out of it” to make a decision on her own. While that would be nice, it is not possible and by asking him how he sees her doing that since she is unable to decide something as simple as what to eat.
Our family is working to shift the stress into a realistic plan taking into consideration Martha’s needs, desires and financial situation. Not the easiest challenge to overcome; however, if you find yourself in a situation which involves unpleasant family disagreements it may be a good idea to find a trained mediator. Many times certified dementia practitioners, geriatric care managers, registered nurses and social workers have been educated to fulfill this role. As always, let me know if I can help!"
118,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/can-companion-care-loved-ones/,"When you think of caregiving, what comes to mind first? While you may think of medical and personal assistance, caregiving does not always equate to nursing care. For many aging Americans or in-need adults, simply having a companion is all that’s required to maintain a comfortable level of independence.
For moments like these, professional companion care can help. Rather than strictly medical assistance, this helpful service places a caregiver with your loved ones so they can enjoy life with a little extra help around the house or even out and about.
Here’s what companion care can do for your loved ones:
- Improved wellbeing: As adults age and retire, staying socially active becomes more difficult, often leading to diminished wellbeing and emotional health. Research has shown that seniors who maintain interpersonal interactions tend to have lower blood pressure and improved mental health. Having a companion can also help reduce the risk for cardiovascular problems, some cancers, osteoporosis, Alzheimer’s and rheumatoid arthritis.
- Greater medication adherence: More than half of American individuals 65-years-old and older regularly take at least five different prescriptions, yet 57 percent of those often forget to take their medication. This disconnect with medication adherence is costing the U.S. healthcare system billions of dollars and leading to unnecessary hospitalizations. With companion care services, caregivers are available to help seniors understand the importance of medication adherence and remind them to take their prescriptions as directed, and have them refilled as prescribed.
- Help inside and out: For many seniors, keeping their home clean, their laundry sorted and their pantry stocked can be difficult. Companion care aids those in need with many of the daily errands we often take for granted.
- Exercise and entertainment: Lacking the motivation to get up and get moving isn’t a senior-only trait – it’s something almost every American can relate to. With companion care, your loved ones will get the support they need to get up and be active, whether it’s a walk in the park or a friendly game of Scrabble.
Caregiving is not always of a clinical nature. Companion care can create a culture of care and a personal connection to help your aging loved ones be happier and healthier. To find out more about what companion care can do for your family, contact your local FirstLight Home Care today."
119,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/cancer-myths-can-be-risky-assumptions/,"Another great post by guest blogger Joni Aldrich. This month, Joni addresses common myths associated with cancer.
A myth is “an unfounded or false notion.” Although not usually considered dangerous, in the wrong context—such as associated with a cancer diagnosis—myths may lead to serious concerns.
All cancers are created equal.
With over 100 different types of cancer, don’t believe they are all created equal. Your own body chemistry, stage at the time of diagnosis, and overall health require special consideration in an effective treatment regimen. In The Saving of Gordon: Lifelines to W-I-N Against Cancer, we discuss the four cancer cash cows (lung, prostate, breast, and colon cancer), the many other rare forms of cancer, the difficult combination cancer diagnosis, and the different approaches necessary to find a treatment facility for each of these.
Every cancer treatment facility can treat most types of cancers.
We all know that the key to success is location, location, location! Isn’t it ironic that we use this guideline regularly, but when faced with the difficult decision of where to receive cancer treatment, families (admittedly in the shock and awe phase) may not be as particular? Be particular. That may involve some challenges, but putting your life into the hands of the wrong treatment center can be catastrophic. Even the best cancer treatment facility will tell you that they are better equipped and educated to treat some types of cancers than others.
You will use the same facility throughout your cancer care.
You could be diagnosed at one facility, have your cancer treatment regimen defined at another (where you may or may not have some or all of your treatments), and then your “home base” facility may provide some of your care. Cancer is a complicated disease.
Your insurance company will work with you to find the best treatment center. Maybe or maybe not. You may have a fight on your hands. It’s in the best interests of everyone concerned to have the right treatment. Does the insurance company really want to pay for ineffective treatments? Communication is crucial.
If you don’t have insurance, you won’t receive treatment. A good friend just died after a long battle with cancer at a top university hospital in Indiana. He didn’t have one stitch of insurance. While this situation is more of a challenge (particularly since you may not have as many choices), you can get treatment. Most facilities have a financial aide or social worker available to help.
All oncologists are created equal.
Sadly, that isn’t the case. In The Saving of Gordon: Lifelines to W-I-N Against Cancer, I cover the bases on the best methods for finding an oncologist. (It’s in the chapter aptly named: Would You Hire a Plumber to Be Your Electrician?)
Every oncologist can treat most types of cancer.
Just like all specialists, there are special specialists. Expect the best for your type of cancer. Don’t be pushed off to the “best in that facility”—you want the best in any facility! After months of ineffective treatment, we finally got Gordon to the right cancer treatment facility. I didn’t want just any of the physicians there (even thought the whole facility specialized in multiple myeloma)—I wanted the head of the department, or the head of research. Ask for the best of the best, or a physician that works next to the best of the best.
You will have the same oncologist for all treatments.
Generally, there are clinical oncologists (the boss), medical oncologists (for chemotherapy), surgical oncologists (for surgery), and radiation oncologists (for radiation therapy). You will likely have a whole oncology team. Your job is to keep them communicating effectively.
I want an oncologist I like.
Bedside manner is great, but I’m sure you’d rather have an oncologist who will keep you out of bed. Gordon’s first oncologist was a very personable man. I regret every single day that he treated Gordon. Yes, you have to have a good relationship with your lifesaver, but actions speak much louder than words.
So, all oncologists are bad.
Absolutely they are not. I can’t imagine why anyone would want to devote his or her life to treating cancer victims, but I’m so glad they do. Essentially, the problem comes in when an oncologist oversteps his or her capabilities and believes that they can treat a cancer that isn’t in their realm of expertise.
All chemotherapy makes you sick.
This is probably the number one myth about chemotherapy, and it isn’t true. Just as some medicines cause you side effects and others do not, chemotherapy “cocktails” are different, and not all of them have the strong negative reactions that we have come to expect when the word “chemotherapy” is spoken. Chemotherapy is possibly the most known and most feared word associated with cancer, even though all cancers are not treated with chemotherapy.
Clinical trials should only be considered as a last resort. Cancer treatments and drugs are being developed so quickly, that the effects even 5-10 years out are not known. Clinical trials are available even when there are other treatment options. They often have many advantages (other than aiding with scientific advances that may be used in the future to prevent, diagnose, or treat cancer). Patients in clinical trials either receive the very best standard treatment or a new treatment that researchers feel is either equal to or better than the standard treatment. There may or may not be a clinical trial open that fits your cancer needs, but it’s important to ask your oncologist."
120,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/capturing-memories-from-older-adults/,"One of the joys of aging is sharing stories. For many older adults, stories are a connection to the past and evidence of a life well-lived. And for the families of these historians, stories are a way to preserve memories for years – and generations – to come.
With so many family activities during the holidays, it’s an ideal time to capture these treasured stories. But when it comes to building this type of family history, where do you begin? Following are some simple steps you can take to plan, capture and archive treasured stories from the older adults in your life.
Step 1: Prepare and plan.
Before jumping in, consider the types of stories or information you’d like to capture. And talk to your loved one to ensure he or she is comfortable with your plan.
- Family lore: Is there a story family members ask your loved one to tell over and over? Archiving it can ensure it lives on forever.
- Your loved one’s life: Do you wish you knew more about your loved one’s life as a child, the city where he or she was born, ancestry or other interesting elements of the family history? Interviews can help you discover new things about your loved one’s past.
- Fascinating tales: Are you curious about the best trip your loved one took, what he or she was like in college, a first love, an award or honor he or she received or other fascinating topic you’ve heard about, but never really explored? Digging into these tales can bring them to life in new ways.
- Enduring advice: Is your loved one known for giving sage advice? Capture some of the best lessons by asking him or her for the best advice about certain topics. Your loved one’s words of wisdom could help even future generations of the family.
Step 2: Gather needed supplies.
Determine how you will record your family historian’s questions-and-answers or storytelling. Journals, family trees and scrapbooks are still widely used today. And access to a variety of technologies now give you the opportunity to capture the stories – via audio, video or both – as they’re being told. Digital recordings can help capture a loved one’s essence and keep it alive well into the future.
In addition to your recording devices, also consider bringing out old family photos or heirlooms. These items can help trigger memories, prompt stories and make the conversation even more meaningful.
Step 3: Document your questions.
Think about the best questions that will help you learn about all of things you planned in Step 1. Open-ended questions are the best for encouraging storytelling. There are many online tools that can help you plan your “interview.” Some of our favorite resources are included at the end of this post.
Step 4: Get comfortable and talk.
In many ways, capturing your loved one’s memories is as simple as having a conversation. Once you’ve decided on an approach and planned what you’d like to talk about, just have a conversation. When capturing conversations digitally, it’s best to select a location that’s comfortable, quiet, has appealing scenery and uses good lighting.
Step 5: Ask for other perspectives.
They say there are two sides to every story. Or, in the case of family history, perhaps several. Consider also capturing related comments, perspectives and anecdotes from other members of the family to help enhance the accounts from the older adults in your life.
Step 6: Backup, share and enjoy.
Once you’ve captured your loved one’s stories, be sure to have a backup: multiple copies of printed pieces and digital backup for electronic images, audio and video. Then, there are only two things left to do: Share and enjoy the memories.
Get great ideas and tools.
There is a seemingly endless list of online resources that offer advice, tips and web-enabled tools to help you capture memories and create a living family history. Some of our favorites include:
- StoryCorps: Since 2003, StoryCorps has been traveling the United States to record, preserve and share stories of Americans from all backgrounds. Its website includes great questions and tips to help you use its approach for your family stories.
- Family History Writing Challenge: While the Family History Writing Challenge was created in 2016 as a way to encourage people to take the month of February to capture their family histories, the tools created for the challenge are valuable and still available today.
- Family Search: Family Search provides tips for capturing stories, as well as search functionality to help uncover details of family genealogy. But unlike other resources, it also provides users with a web-based resource to store and archive their stories and family history.
- Instructables Article: Instructables is a website/community created by students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for project and idea sharing. But it’s evolved to a destination for all “creators” to share ideas, how-tos and instructions. The article “Record Your Family’s Oral History – Before It Dies Out” is a detailed guide for capturing your family’s memories, from a person just like you who has personal experience.
- Family Tree Magazine: A family history publication, Family Tree Magazine provides how-to resources for discovering and preserving a family’s “roots.” Its website has a variety of articles and tools that can help you capture your memories.
- If your loved one is still able to document his or her own memories, there are volumes of diaries and journals out there to help them do it. We like “Memories for My Grandchild: A Keepsake to Remember” by Suzanne Zenkel and “Letters to My Grandchild: Write Now. Read Later. Treasure Forever.” by Lea Redmond.

121,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/cardiovascular-disease-risk/,"February is American Heart Month, an ideal time to commit to making small changes that can lead to a lifetime of heart health. Know your cardiovascular disease risk.
Cardiovascular disease (also known as heart disease) remains the leading global cause of death for men and women, with more than 17.3 million deaths each year. That number is expected to rise to more than 23 million by 2030.
There are several types of cardiovascular disease, including:
- Heart failure: sometimes called congestive heart failure, this means the heart isn’t pumping blood as well as it should.
- Arrhythmia: an abnormal rhythm of the heart.
- Heart valve problems: these arise when heart valves don’t open enough to allow the blood to flow through as it should.
- Heart attack: when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked by a blood clot.
- Ischemic stroke: when a blood vessel that feeds the brain gets blocked, usually from a blood clot.
- Hemorrhagic stroke: when a blood vessel within the brain bursts. The most likely cause of this is uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure).
Who is at Risk?
There are several cardiovascular disease risk factors. Some can be changed, and some cannot. And, having more than one risk factor means the overall chance of cardiovascular disease is much higher.
Risk factors that cannot be changed are:
- Your age – risk increases as you age.
- Your gender – before the age of 60, men are at greater risk than women. Women’s risk increases after menopause.
- Your family history – children of parents with heart disease are more likely to develop it themselves. And most people with a strong family history have one or more other risk factors.
But there are other risk factors that you can change or manage, including:
- Elevated levels of blood cholesterol
- Raised triglycerides with low HDL-cholesterol
- High blood pressure
- Diabetes
- Smoking
- Being overweight or obese
- Being inactive
- Eating an unhealthy diet
- Excessive alcohol consumption
- High stress levels
At FirstLight Home Care, we work with our clients to create individualized care plans that promote well-being and a heart-healthy lifestyle. If you are a family caregiver and need assistance with your aging senior, our FirstLight caregivers can assist with a variety of needs such as:
- Dressing and hygiene to prepare for doctor appointments
- Providing transportation to and from check-ups, rehabilitation or social activities
- Support and companionship before, during and after appointments
- Ensuring clients follow care plans from their doctor
- Medication reminders
- Shopping for foods that are healthy or those that a doctor has prescribed
- Meal preparation according to healthier guidelines
- Help with moving more, whether it’s going for a walk or just repositioning
You’re never too young to start heart-healthy living. If you are over 40, or if you have multiple risk factors, work closely with your doctor to address your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Learn more from The American Heart Association."
122,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/care-after-a-hospital-discharge/,"For aging adults, a trip to the hospital has the potential to stretch on for several days, and medical procedures can bring a host of new caregiving responsibilities that continue even after the patient heads home.
Older adults often need greater levels of care during a hospital stay, and this translates into greater care requirements after a discharge as well. It’s important that family caregivers fully understand what’s needed as soon as possible, which can better equip them to organize the care necessary to keep their loved ones safe and help them heal.
Understanding Hospital Discharge Care
Depending on your loved one’s needs, you may decide on a short-term residential care community, or make other decisions based on their care needs. Whatever you choose, make sure that the caregiving responsibilities are within the scope you or the professional caregivers can provide. Missed medication and accidents can lead to hospital readmission, which may make it more difficult to return home each time.
Loved ones may also require additional equipment, like oxygen tanks or wheelchairs. Knowing about these in advance can give you and your family time to prepare the home by making sure it’s a comfortable, safe place to rest and recuperate.
Finally, coordinate elements of post-discharge care, including observation, wound-dressing or other tasks with other family members, as well as professional caregivers.
Preparation is Key
Without a plan, caring for a loved one after a hospital discharge can be incredibly difficult. Not only are the care requirements amplified, but caregivers may worry about anything that can go wrong: impaired mobility leading to a fall, drug interactions causing serious health complications, even the possibility of their loved one’s health failing to improve. All of these are valid concerns, but there are ways to find peace of mind.
Preparing for a discharge should begin as soon as your loved one is admitted to the hospital so that you and your family can arrange everything your loved one needs before they’re cleared to return home. This can prevent frantic searching for professional care or prevent the mistakes that may come from heightened anxiety and stress.
Knowing the specifics of your loved one’s post-discharge care, working with the doctors and nursing staff to get a clear picture of their health, and knowing your options are all ways to ease the stress and anxiety of caring for a recently hospitalized family member.
By being ready and organized, you can be sure that your loved one receives the best care possible from you and the rest of their care team. Even better, they’ll feel well-taken care of if they see you’re in control of the situation. Overall, everyone involved can breathe a little easier when the trickier aspects of care are given consideration in advance.
Finding a Care Solution
It’s important for family caregivers to recognize that hospitalization can frequently lead to a comprehensive care plan that lasts well beyond the hospital discharge or change the way they must approach care going forward. This can be a scary and difficult time for family caregivers. But preparedness can provide stability and security to the caregiver and help them feel more confident in their own abilities and the health of their loved one.
When a family member requires more care, it may be appropriate to consider a long-term solution, such as professional in-home care services. If you find yourself struggling to maintain a balance between full-time caregiving and your other responsibilities, in-home care can provide the post-discharge attention your loved ones need when you’re at work, or otherwise dealing with the necessities of life.
Above all, caregivers can make sure their loved ones receive the best care possible by being present when they can and being prepared to make the right care choices after a hospital discharge.

123,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/care-for-aging-parents-best-foods-to-eat/,"When you are younger, it’s not as hard on your body to eat an unbalanced or unhealthy diet, (Oh, to be young again). Unfortunately, the more we age, the more crucial it is to eat a healthy, balanced diet on a regular basis. Focusing on the senior population specifically, it is even more essential for seniors to eat a well-balanced diet. There are certain foods seniors should eat regularly that can benefit them greatly during the aging process:
- Calcium and Vitamin D – Calcium is crucial to bone growth, strength and overall health. Strong and healthy bones can help prevent falling and injuries from falling. Consuming Calcium and Vitamin D on a daily, balanced basis can prevent Osteoporosis. Foods high in Calcium and Vitamin D are dairy products, spinach, soybeans, orange juice, oatmeal, and cereal. These are only a few options; there are plenty of other foods to boost Calcium and Vitamin D intake.
- Water – The aging process can have a strange affect on us. As we age, our body doesn’t always recognize if we are thirsty, which means staying hydrated can be a
bigger challenge than anticipated. Making sure to drink plenty of water is extremely important!
- Fruits and Veggies – It may seem like a no-brainer, but fruits and veggies are
full of nutrients that fight against bad toxins in the body, and they also help to build and maintain a strong immune system.
- Protein – Beans, eggs, peanuts, or various assorted nuts, fish, milk and cheese, (to name a few), all provide protein which aids in mind and memory health, maintaining bone density and muscle, as well as physical strength.
When you’re providing care for an aging parent or loved one, remember that it is just as important for you to eat healthy on a daily basis as it is for your loved one. Making sure you both are eating the best foods ensures that you are able to provide and care for them to your fullest ability, which in turn allows your loved one to be healthy and happy as well."
124,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/care-giving-tips-for-an-only-child/,"If you are an only child caring for elderly parents, you know it can be a handful. In this case. you may feel the stresses of care giving are all on you. It may even start to define your livelihood. As much as you love your parents and know they deserve the best care possible, it is okay, and will be better for all, if you continue to have a life too and feel comfortable delegating others to help. Here are a few tips to consider.
- Don’t be afraid to ask other relatives for help. Many times, other family members and friends are ready to step in when needed. This may require you
to ask for help since they may not want to feel as if they’re imposing. Even if it’s a simple drive to the grocery store once a week.
- Understand your parent and seek professional help. If your parent is suffering from Alzheimer’s or other age related diseases, it would be in their best interest to spend time with those experienced in the issue.
- Dive into their financial needs. The relationship between you and your parents will be at advantage if you speak of financial needs. Understand how much your parents’ need to continue medical care and every day living and how much they need your help in budgeting. If this amount is greater than you are comfortable with, seek out a trusted financial advisor.
- Maintain safety measures for your parents. It is a good idea to make sure their home is built and set up for aging parents. You may not feel like you have to be there all the time, if you know they are in a safe spot. Have someone, or if you’re handy, do it yourself, go through the house fixing any areas that could cause falls or any type of injury. If your parents are unfit to live alone, find a reputable assisted living center in your area.
- Don’t feel guilty. Easier said than done, but guilt is an emotion that is not beneficial to you or your aging parents. Do everyone a favor and channel your emotional energies into something more productive. You are only one person!
Continuing a positive relationship with your parents will only help them through the aging process. If your caretaking responsibilities add stress to this relationship, it will only hurt all involved. It is important to make sure your parents receive proper care but to also be okay with letting go and getting help when needed."

126,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/caregiver-burnout-vs-compassion-fatigue/,"For many, it’s hard to tell the difference between caregiver burnout and compassion fatigue, but there is a difference.
Compassion fatigue occurs initially when caregivers cannot remove themselves from their loved one’s condition long enough to recover from the stress they feel when attending to another person’s needs. The caregiver can feel trapped and overwhelmed and can experience guilt, trauma, and depression.
Compassion fatigue can come on suddenly and often includes:
- Exhaustion (physical and/or emotional)
- Feelings of dread or guilt
- Irritability, anxiety or anger
- Difficulty sleeping
- Difficulty making decisions
- Feeling disconnected
- Trouble finding meaning in caregiving
- Self-isolation
Caregiver burnout, however, is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion. It often occurs because caregivers, over a long period of time, are so busy caring for others that they tend to neglect their own emotional, physical and spiritual health.
Caring for an aging loved one is demanding and it can become overwhelming. Burnout develops over time because the caregiver does not get the help they need, or they try to do more than they are either physically or financially able to do. Symptoms of caregiver burnout are like those you experience when under stress or feeling depressed. Warning signs also may include:
- Withdrawal from friends and family
- Loss of interest in activities previously enjoyed
- Feeling blue, irritable, hopeless and helpless
- Changes in appetite, weight, or both
- Changes in sleep patterns
- Getting sick more often
- Feelings of wanting to hurt yourself or the person for whom you are caring
- Emotional and physical exhaustion
- Excessive use of alcohol and/or sleep medications
- Irritability
If you or the family caregiver in your life is dealing with compassion fatigue or caregiver burnout, there are several things that may help reduce these feelings.
- Take care of yourself by scheduling time away from caregiving. Ask other family members or friends to step in while you step out for an hour or two of “you time.”
- If you don’t have a family to support you, or you need more structure in your caregiving to allow for some personal time, consider respite care provided by professional and compassionate caregivers.
- Eat right, exercise and get plenty of sleep.

As a caregiver, you spend considerable time and energy determining and meeting the needs of the person you are caring for, but all too often, you neglect to devote the same attention to your own needs. When this happens you are likely to suffer from caregiver burnout. Without considering your own needs, you’ll often find that you have a harder time coping with stress and you begin to suffer physically, emotionally, and mentally.
Why Caregiver Burnout Happens
Whether you are providing care for a parent, a spouse, or a child, you are still at risk for caregiver burnout. Burnout isn’t the result of one major catastrophe, but is a result of the accumulation of stress, circumstances, and your experiences as a caregiver. Even though you love the person you are caring for, the round-the-clock demands, both physically and emotionally, can have quite an impact on your body.
If you are a caregiver, you should learn to recognize the signs of caregiver burnout so that you can get the help you need in order to improve your own health and continue to provide quality care. It is important that you realize that caring for yourself allows you to develop the strength that you need to provide the care that your loved one needs.
1. Lack of Concentration
This early warning sign may take the form of forgetfulness or difficulty focusing on everyday tasks. You may begin to miss appointments, forget where you are going, or wonder why you’ve gone down to the basement. Another direction this warning sign could take is forgetting how to do simple tasks which you have completely repeatedly without trouble.
2. Difficulty Sleeping and Changes in Your Appetite
Don’t ignore the warning sign of sleeplessness. A change in your sleeping habits may be a very easy way to notice that something is causing you stress. Whether the change is that you can’t get to sleep or that you are having difficulty staying asleep, this is a sign that you are experiencing burnout. If this situation sounds familiar, then you should be particularly alert to the presence of other warning signs.
Be aware of your eating habits. If you don’t notice that you are skipping meals or suddenly gaining weight, hopefully you have friends who can alert you to this situation. You might want to track your eating habits if you have begun to notice some changes.
3. Withdrawal from People and Activities
Another important sign that you are suffering from caregiver burnout is that the friends and activities which you once enjoyed, no longer appeal to you. If you can’t remember the last time you went out with your friends or if you just don’t have the energy to go out with friends, then you should consider carefully the possibility that you have not taken care of yourself as you need. When you don’t feel the same sense of satisfaction and enjoyment that your hobbies and activities once gave you, it is time to talk to someone who can help.
4. Feelings of Anger, Frustration, Hopelessness, or Loss of Control
At first you may find yourself snapping at others or getting annoyed at things that once didn’t bother you. Your feelings of hopelessness or depression should be given the credit they deserve. You will only truly be able to care for your loved one if you are also caring for yourself. You may feel angry toward the person you are providing care for or begin to neglect that person. Eventually you might find that you are handling your loved one with roughness or even hurting them.
5. Weakened Immunity
One common symptom of carrying too much stress is a weakened immune system. If you are catching every bug that comes around, if you get sick more than you used to and if you stay sick longer than you used to, these are signs that you are already experiencing burnout or are on your way to burnout.
6. Excessive Use of Alcohol or Drugs
This is a serious symptom of caregiver burnout and will have destructive consequences for both you and the person you are caring for. Before you beginning drinking or taking too many sleeping pills to get through the night, take some time to really think about your current lifestyle. There are many more healthy ways to reduce your stress and avoid burnout than turning to drinking or drugs.
Tips to Prevent or Ease Caregiver Burnout
- Remind yourself that you are human and give yourself permission to make mistakes.
- Stay up-to-date on your preventative medical, dental, and other health exams.
- Visit with your doctor when you feel that you are getting sick.
- Pay attention to your diet and make sure that you are getting the nutrition that you need.
- Try to get seven or more hours of sleep each night.
- Find a friend or support group where you can share your frustrations and struggles. Sometimes just talking about the situation will relieve some of the stress you are experiencing.
- Create a schedule that allows you to complete the things of priority to you.
- Make time to exercise. Consistent exercise can alleviate a lot of the symptoms of stress and the endorphins from exercising can help to lift your mood.
- Schedule time out with friends or some quiet time for yourself.
- Ask for help when you need it. It isn’t a sign of weakness to care for your needs. When the demands of being a caregiver become too much for one person, reach out to your friends, family, church, or a professional to help you cope.
As a caregiver you spend a lot of time trying to anticipate and meet the needs of your loved one. In order to provide consistent, loving care, it is critical that you devote the same attention to your own needs. As you address your own feelings of stress or frustration, you will be better prepared to deal with the emotional and physical demands of your loved one.
As soon as you begin to experience the warning signs of caregiver burnout, you should take steps to remedy your own situation. Allow yourself to take a step back in order to determine the best route to your own healthy recovery.

Many times, people find themselves in positions they don’t enjoy or aren’t well-suited for simply because that’s what’s available and becomes comfortable over time. However, it’s a new year and a great time for a change if you’re looking for an opportunity with more meaning. If that’s the case, consider a caregiver job with FirstLight® Home Care.
Here’s a look at what a caregiver job entails and why our team is different.
Why Consider a Job in Caregiving?
Being a caregiver is not your typical job. You’re not sitting in an office at a desk. Instead, you’re working one-on-one with an individual, helping them get the support and attention they need to thrive. This care often happens in one’s own home, but can sometimes be in a medical facility, such as a nursing home or rehabilitation center. Wherever care is provided, you’ll be assisting someone who is elderly, disabled, recovering from surgery or chronically ill, so they can live their best life.
- Meeting new people. You can meet new people, work with a range of different families and make friends and connections along the way. If you love people, especially interacting with them one-on-one, caregiving could be a fit for you.
- Gain valuable skills. You’ll gain many practical and useful skills that you’ll use on the job and in everyday life. For instance, you’ll be trained in what to do in a range of emergency situations. This will not only prepare you to handle emergencies at work, but in life, too.
- Job Security. You’ll have a job that’s secure with competitive pay. The demand for at-home caregivers is on the rise, particularly with an aging population. So, if it’s a job that’s a fit for you, you can enjoy stability and a good quality of life with it.
What Makes FirstLight Home Care Different?
At FirstLight Home Care, you’ll be working for a team who will treat you like family. You’ll also be a part of a team filled with good-hearted, caring people who simply want to help others. We’re a different kind of employer, one with a unique, client-centered culture. As a result, you’ll get to do something that truly matters to someone else and makes a real difference in their lives.
Some types of caregiver jobs we regularly fill include:
- Home Health Aides
- CNAs
- Care Coordinators / Scheduler
- Companion Caregivers
- Personal Care Assistants
- Case Manager
Whichever position most interests you, we always look for individuals with integrity, empathy and compassion, and those who can serve our clients with dignity and respect. Overall, our purpose is to make life easier and more enriching for individuals and their families.
What if I Don’t Have Caregiving Experience?
As experts in caregiving, we know there are many skills that are transferable from jobs in other industries. In fact, some of our best caregivers have come from fields like retail, customer service and hospitality. The common thread is that they enjoy taking care of others and they want to help.
If that sounds like something you’d be interested in, we offer comprehensive caregiver training. In fact, we’ve developed the industry’s best when it comes to home care training and technology. This ensures you’ll be well-prepared and feel comfortable and confident walking into that first client’s home.
What is Working for FirstLight Home Care Like?
First and foremost, you’re a direct employee and part of our family, not an independent contractor. We also offer competitive pay and flexible hours. You can make a difference for others in a way that works best for your lifestyle and schedule.
In addition, we offer opportunities for personal and career development and advancement. This means once you get your foot in the door with our team, your future looks bright in a rewarding new career.
In fact, we work hard to cultivate relationships that not only benefit our clients, but our caregivers as well. We respect diversity, emphasize quality of life, and provide a meaningful career path for caregivers who are passionate about helping others.
Some other aspects that set our caregiver jobs apart include:
- We place a strong emphasis on teamwork and collaboration.

129,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/caregiver-stress-syndrome/,"Caregiver Stress Syndrome is a condition in which a caregiver experiences physical, emotional and mental exhaustion. Typically, this occurs when a caregiver neglects their own physical and emotional health because they are focused on caring for an ill, injured, disabled, or aging loved one. They also often try to take on more responsibility than they should, and they feel guilty about taking time for themselves.
Signs of caregiver stress syndrome:
- Feeling overwhelmed or constantly worried
- Feeling tired often
- Getting too much sleep or not enough sleep
- Gaining or losing weight
- Becoming easily irritated or angry
- Losing interest in activities you used to enjoy
- Feeling sad
- Having frequent headaches, bodily pain, or other physical problems
- Misusing alcohol or drugs
Tips to help family caregivers avoid caregiver stress syndrome:
- Accept help by preparing a list of ways that others can help you and let them choose what he or she would like to do. If friends or family members cannot help, hire a local in-home caregiver to support you.
- Break down large tasks into smaller projects that you can do one at a time. Prioritize your day by setting realistic goals.
- Learn to say “no” and avoid taking on too many other responsibilities.
- Search out local and online resources to help you identify and address any changes you are facing due to caregiver stress. Healthcentral is a helpful resource to learn more about causes, symptoms, and treatments related to stress and depression.
- Join a local support group. Finding people who have gone or are going through what you are experiencing can provide validation, encouragement and problem-solving strategies.
- Find time each day to relax, rest, exercise or simply do something you enjoy.
- Take time off from your responsibilities as a primary caregiver so that you can focus on yourself for a while. Respite care services allow you to take a couple of hours, an entire day, overnight, or even longer-term if needed so you can take care of yourself without compromising the quality of care and attention your loved one needs.
As a family caregiver, you must address signs of stress and make your own health a priority so that you can continue to provide care for your loved one.
Now more than ever, family caregivers are faced with the stress that comes with caring for an aging loved one.

131,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/caregiving-does-not-discriminate/,"I’m happy to introduce another guest blogger this week. Cindy Laverty is a nationally recognized caregiving expert who has dedicated her life to empowering caregivers. Today, she discusses her personal experiences as a family caregiver.
Caregiving does not discriminate and caregiving usually happens when we least expect it. If not managed in an organized way from the beginning, it has the potential to rock and wrack your world. The good news is that it doesn’t have to be this way. I know this to be true, because it happened to me.
Several years ago, I was one of those people literally thrown into a situation I knew nothing about. I was asked by my former father-in-law, (yes, my ex-husband’s father) to pay his bills and check on his wife (who suffered from severe arthritis and dementia) while he had open-heart surgery at 83 years of age. His reason for having such invasive and risky surgery was so he could see his granddaughter (my daughter) graduate from college and, as he said to me, “Without this operation, I won’t make it.”
You can imagine the impact of such a statement. I agreed without giving it any further thought, never imagining that I would one day dedicate my life to teaching family caregivers how to manage the journey without losing themselves in the process. I naively thought this promise to help out would be a minor investment of my time. For a number of complicated reasons, I was the only person who was capable of stepping forward to care for Bob and his wife, and I was honored that he trusted me to handle this role. I’m certain that neither of us realized the impact it would have on both of our lives and our relationship.
The fourteen-hour operation was only the beginning of what became the most fascinating education of my life. I knew nothing of the geriatric world or the needs of those living in it. I learned quickly about hospitals, doctors, nurses, protocols, bureaucracy, insurance forms, Medicare, prescription drugs, and how to manage them. I learned how easy it is to get lost in this system and, consequently, I spent a good portion of the first year learning how to avoid being abused by the system. My learning curve had to be swift and precise.
My agreement to pay bills and check on his wife turned very quickly into a full-time obligation. She was suffering from severe dementia and her caregivers were not properly caring for her. The key to keeping her in a peaceful, unagitated state was the proper administration of her mediations, which required special attention. The house was in disrepair. The caregivers needed replacement. The new caregivers needed training. The bills needed attention. Past due bills needed immediate attention. Visits to the hospital were daily; morning and early evening, with emergencies added to the mix. My responsibility didn’t stop here. There were numerous medical issues to deal with: insomnia, depression, seizures, weakness, incontinence, functionality, balance, and the overall day-to-day challenges that the elderly experience when life begins to take its toll on the body.
Clearly, my role was not going to be temporary. If you had told me many years ago that I’d be a caregiver for my ex-father-in-law, I would have thought you were crazy. But this became my life. I didn’t have time to think about the consequences of this change for me; I had work to do and I wasn’t going to let him down. I was on call 24/7, 365 days a year. I visited him daily. Sometimes we had beautiful visits with laughter and remembrances, and then there were those other days when he was just mad at the world and I received the brunt of his anger. There were days when he just sat and stared into space and I read or chatted (for what seemed like endless amounts of time) just to fill the air with sound. Over time, I learned never to take his mood swings personally. I learned to look past the day-to-day feelings and try to focus on the beauty of what we brought to each other’s lives. He thought I was his angel (The first man who has ever called me that!) and for me, caring for him was the catalyst that taught me the importance of self care…self care without guilt. I learned that I mattered. I learned that I didn’t have to always say YES for fear that someone wasn’t going to like me. I learned to set boundaries and that changed my life. I learned more from him and my caregiving journey than he did from me.
For almost six years, I cared for this man and, not a day goes by that I don’t think of him and thank him for the gift of helping me find myself.
Today my life is truly rich because the Universe presented itself to me in a way that I was never expecting. I learned a million little things from being a caregiver. I learned to celebrate how blessed my life is because of giving to another.

132,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/caregiving-doesnt-stop-if-your-loved-one-is-hospitalized/,"Today we handed the spotlight over to Martine Ehrenclou, M.A., an award-winning author and patient advocate, who shared her personal experiences of handling the care and hospitalization of her mother and godmother and how others can navigate the intimidating hospital world. Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments section below. Have a great weekend, all!
— Jeff Bevis
I began my journey into advocacy eleven years ago when my mother and godmother were patients in hospitals for very lengthy stays (five months and seven months respectively.) I was not prepared for what I saw and experienced with their care as I’d never been in a hospital before except to give birth to our daughter.
I did not know at the time that what I was doing was called “advocacy.” I simply thought that I was helping my loved ones who were subjected to neglect, misdiagnoses, medication mistakes, hospital infections, and a variety of other medical errors. It was their suffering at the hands of a system I once thought was the safest place a patient could be that drove me into the role of advocate and author for my last award-winning book, Critical Conditions: The Essential Hospital Guide To Get Your Loved One Out Alive.
Even though the subtitle sounds and looks scary, it’s really about keeping your loved one safe during a hospital stay. And there is something you can do. Plenty, actually. Just because there are nearly 100,000 fatal medical errors that occur each year in hospitals, doesn’t mean you can’t prevent many of them. You can.
If you have an older loved one going into the hospital, there are several strategies to implement to keep him/her safe and comfortable. Remember, nurses are dealing with patient overload and especially on nights, weekends and holiday weekends, there are fewer nurses to care for patients. Since you are already a caregiver for your loved one, becoming an advocate is simply an extension of that. Read over the following tips and prepare ahead of time so if in the event your loved one has to be in the hospital for a period of time, you’ll know exactly what to do.
1. Become your loved one’s advocate. Since patients are ill, recovering or sedated, it is nearly impossible for them to advocate for themselves. Try to imagine keeping track of your medications, conversations with physicians and nurses, procedures, treatments and tests while you are too sick to be walking around.
2. Get a notebook. This notebook will be used to take notes on conversations with medical professionals and to document your loved one’s diagnosis, treatment plan, any test, procedure or surgery he/she is to have during the hospital stay. Also document the names and contact information for primary nurses and doctors who take care of the patient.
3. Create a list of your loved one’s medications. In partnership with the patient, (if possible) create a list of his/her current medications, their dosages, over-the-counter medications, herbs and supplements. List his/her allergies to medications.
4. Create a patient safety checklist. Create a patient safety checklist with the patient. You or your loved one will repeat each item at each new medical encounter during the hospital stay.
-The patient’s full name.
-The patient’s date of birth.
-The patient’s physician’s name.
-The patient’s diagnosis and treatment plan.
5. Identify the patient’s primary nurses. Make sure you know who the registered nurses are who are responsible for your loved one’s care. Hospital staff dress alike. You don’t want to accidentally ask a hospital tech for pain medication for the patient. Your request will never make it to the appropriate medical professional—the primary nurse.
6. Prevent hospital-acquired infectious diseases. Ask everyone who comes in contact with your loved one to wash their hands thoroughly (in warm, soapy water for 20 seconds) and that includes nurses and doctors. Try to get a private hospital room to cut down on the number of medical professionals and visitors who enter the room and can bring in diseases.
7. Be aware when the patient is discharged. Many errors occur upon discharge. Be with your loved one when the discharge planner or nurse is preparing the patient for discharge. Write down details about home care, when your loved one should schedule an appointment with his/her doctor, which medications should be taken and when. Ask for a plan for home care.
8. Ask questions. If there is anything you don’t understand or are confused about, ask questions. It is okay to ask for clarification from the doctors and nurses who are caring for your loved one. If something seems out of the ordinary, speak up!
Martine Ehrenclou, M.A., is an award-winning author and patient advocate. Her mission is bring to light the importance of advocacy for ourselves and others. Her last book, Critical Conditions: The Essential Hospital Guide To Get Your Loved One Out Alive (Lemon Grove Press) won 15 book awards.

Now, that it is officially October, awareness for the disease does not stop! At FirstLight Home Care we continue to raise awareness, challenge the stigma and support those who are working to find an end to this disease all year long.
The quick and sobering facts of Alzheimer’s disease show us that the impact and the battle for a cure are far from over. FirstLight has always been committed to sharing helpful, and up-to-date information on Alzheimer’s disease and providing services that help you and your family. Here we have compiled some of our most popular, helpful posts especially for those providing care in a world with Alzheimer’s and dementia.
FACT: More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s. By 2050, this number is projected to rise to nearly 14 million
In June, during Alzheimer’s and Brain Awareness Month, we published a blog titled “Early Signs of Alzheimer’s”. In this blog, we outlined the 10 early warning signs and symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, and the importance of addressing these symptoms because of early detection matters.
FACT: Alzheimer’s disease is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States
In August we published a blog titled “What are the Seven Stages of Alzheimer’s?”. Alzheimer’s is a progressive disease that gradually worsens over a period of four to 20 years based on recent data from the Alzheimer’s Association. On average, however, most people live between four to eight years following diagnosis. The progression of the disease may be different for each person, but typically, the sequence of this disease is consistent.
FACT: More than 16 million Americans provide unpaid care for people living with Alzheimer’s or other dementias – these caregivers provide an estimated 18.6 billion hours of care valued at nearly $244 billion
In September 2019, we published a blog titled “Avoiding Caregiver Burnout When Dealing with Alzheimer’s”. Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s is a tough job. The stress, demand, and constant worry can take a heavy toll on the family caregiver, so much that they often do not take good care of themselves. It can also be an emotional journey as the family member providing care watches their loved one’s memories disappear and their daily skills decline. This inevitably will lead to caregiver burnout. In this blog, we shared 8 tips to help you avoid caregiver burnout.
As October begins to usher in the holiday season, we know that being the family caregiver to a loved one living with Alzheimer’s can be difficult. In December of 2019, we published “Alzheimer’s During the Holidays”. In this post, we asked our FirstLight caregivers to share tips to help make the holidays merry, bright, and most of all, memorable for everyone. It was one of our most popular blog posts ever.
If you or a loved one is living with Alzheimer’s disease, FirstLight Home Care is here to help. Our Dementia and Alzheimer’s Care services focus on person-first care. We work with your family to build specific and individualized Alzheimers and dementia care plans for daily care.
Contact us for more information on how FirstLight’s Dementia Program can give you peace of mind and make a difference in your loved one’s dementia or Alzheimer’s care. Our long-term caregivers have the solutions you seek.
FirstLight Home Care is proud to CHAMPION the family caregiver, offering empathy, advice, and support for those who provide countless hours of care to their loved ones living with Alzheimer’s. We want to provide a helping hand, relieve some of the stress that comes with caregiving, and give you back a few hours in your overwhelmingly busy day.

After all, I have been a Registered Nurse since 1973 and worked as a candy striper starting in junior high. But I continue to be faced with generalizations when it comes to some of the medical community working with people. It saddens me for those who do not have the knowledge to make decisions, often very tough decisions regarding their loved ones, on their own.
Recently, I have had the challenge of caring for my mother-in-law with Alzheimer’s disease. This is not the first time for this situation; as I cared for my aunt and a mother-in-law from my first marriage as well. Both of these individuals succumbed to this terrible disease and much to my chagrin lost their battle in a nursing home setting. Thus this time we are doing everything possible to keep Martha, my current mother-in-law, at home. My sister-in-law and her husband share care with my husband and me giving both families respite time without the pressures Martha’s disease creates in daily living.
Just imagine trying to answer the repetitive question of “When are you taking me home?” which she sometimes asks every minute, without becoming agitated. Or, her refusals to take a shower or brush her teeth no matter what diversion techniques are used. Naturally, the work from home husbands do not want to be involved in the resistant bathing ritual, so we have a caregiver from FirstLight Home Care help Martha with these activities of daily living. After all, she still has her dignity and we want to help her feel good for as long as possible.
Alzheimer’s affects people in different ways and their behaviors change over time. Martha still has good times when she helps me fix our favorite homemade chicken salad, folds her clothes and puts them away or when we look at the photo albums of her family. We try to keep her moving and walking as much as possible; however, she is becoming more fragile and unable to endure even short walks outside. The other day her legs simply went out from under her and she collapsed to the floor. We called the paramedics who took her to the emergency room. When we arrived the doctor immediately suggested she needed to go into long-term care. We told him that as a family, we were not ready for that and believe we can continue to care for her at home since this was the one and only request she had of us prior to her illness.
Here is where the generalization comes in to play. The doctor and hospital staff did not take the time to ask the right questions or determine the wishes of the family. They did not have lab tests, EKG or even know what medications she was taking. They jumped to the conclusion that because she suffers from Alzheimer’s disease she needs to be taken out of her loving families home and institutionalized. I adamantly disagree….and made this very clear to the doctor! After much discussion it was decided to admit her and determine the cause for her weakness, which turned out to be dehydration.
She will spend some time in a Rehabilitation facility to get physical and occupational therapy. After she comes home she may continue to need these services; but I believe this is what is best for her. What I want everyone to know is to not necessarily take someones word as the ultimate answer just because they work in the medical field. Look at your loved one. Be their advocate. Help the rest of their life be as purposeful as it can be and know there are options and alternatives out there for care."
135,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/caregiving-tips-from-nurse-gina/,"Here at FirstLight Home Care, we believe it takes an incredibly special person to be a caregiver. Patience, understanding, unconditional love and kindness to not just a loved one, but to others in need of care as well. It’s not easy being a caregiver; there are struggles emotionally, mentally and of course, at the end of the day, physically, you are exhausted. Whether you are caring for a loved one or for several others-it doesn’t matter. You are an extraordinary person.
You may be familiar with our very own Nurse Gina. With more than 40 years of experience as an RN, geriatric care manager and personal caregiver to her aunt and mother-in-law, Nurse Gina is an expert. When it comes to caregiving, there are five tips Nurse Gina says we should always keep in mind:
- Do your research; stay up-to-date on the best caregiving methods, practices and resources. Research and do your best to understand what your loved one or client is going through so you are able to better meet their needs.
- Have or get support. You are constantly caring for and meeting someone else’s needs, putting them before yourself. Caregivers need support too; they need their needs met at one point or another. Find a support group near you, (hospitals and many organizations, such as the Alzheimer Association, may have groups or be able to share information on groups in your area).
- Put your pride aside and ask for help. Caregiving for others, especially loved ones is extremely difficult physically, mentally and emotionally. You will need help at some point. Don’t be afraid to ask for it. The less stressed you are, the better you are able to serve and care for another.
- Don’t forget about your own health. Seeking a support group takes care of your emotional needs, but what about your physical and mental health? Find time to eat healthy, exercise and receive a satisfactory amount of sleep, as well as good quality sleep. The healthier you are and feel, the better you will be able to provide quality care for another.
- Stay organized. Maintaining an organized system or routine will help you from becoming overwhelmed. Track and log medications, eating habits, mood changes, changes in behavior, doctor visits and appointments, and all contact information for medical and emergency situations.
If you have any caregiving questions or concerns, Nurse Gina is here to help and guide you, and will maintain strict confidentiality. Ask Nurse Gina!"

DeShawn Joiner, FirstLight Home Care 2016 Caregiver of the Year
November is an important and treasured month for FirstLight Home Care. Each year, we observe National Home Care Month, as well as National Family Caregivers Awareness Month. While we’re always grateful for the important role we play – caring for our clients and supporting family caregivers – November is an opportunity for us to truly reflect on just what it means to be a caregiver.
Caring Is Our Calling
FirstLight was created with a purpose: To offer a new way of helping people achieve the quality of life they deserve. For those who invite us into their lives, no two situations are the same. We care for older adults who long for companionship and those managing chronic diseases. We’re there for people with disabilities and those recovering from surgery. We bring an extra set of hands to mothers who have just brought home new babies or people navigating important life transitions. Regardless of our clients’ circumstances and needs, one thing is consistent: We are called to care for them. To support them. To enrich their lives. To go the extra mile.
What does that mean? It means we value the real, personal connections we have with the people we care for. Home care is all about helping with dressing, meal preparation, transportation, medication reminders, travel assistance and so many of the activities that are part of daily life. But for FirstLight, caregiving goes deeper. It’s about cheering on every bit of progress. Honoring every milestone. Celebrating every victory. Capturing every memory. Sharing every heartbreak. For so many clients, we get the opportunity to be more than a service provider. We become an extension of – a part of – the family.
It is the FirstLight Culture of Care that defines us as caregivers and leads us to play such a significant role in our clients’ families. That culture is reflected in every FirstLight location across the country. It means we nurture healthy relationships for life. We are receptive to and anticipate the needs of those we serve. We are empowered to create a unique, healthy and comfortable environment. We foster teamwork and collaboration to exceed expectations. And we constantly strive to learn and grow.
Our Professionals Are More Than Caregivers
It also means that we consider ourselves – we expect ourselves – to be more than caregivers. That’s because we understand that to the people we serve, we are problem solvers. Grocery shoppers. Bathing helpers. Organizers. Hope givers. Tour guides. Listeners. Huggers. Personal chefs. Activity planners. Conversationalists. Hair stylists. Freedom creators. Errand runners. Laundry folders. Smile makers. Confidants. Good friends. And so much more.
Supporting Family Caregivers Is Our Honor
Because what we do is so deeply rooted in the family, we have the opportunity to provide support to those who are truly the unsung heroes: family caregivers.
Family caregivers begin as we all do – as daughters, sons, sisters, brothers, husbands, wives, friends. But they’re thrust into situations that push them to transcend – and at times, almost set aside – those roles. They become more focused on another’s comfort and care than they are on their own. They struggle with being stretched thin, stressed out and overwhelmed. But they persevere. Determined to make life better, easier, happier for someone else. And they make a profound difference in the lives of their loved ones.
Just as much as we delight in the blossoming of the people we care for, we admire the achievements of family caregivers. These heroes deserve to be celebrated and supported. Thanked and embraced. It is truly our honor to help them resume their roles as family members, restore more balance in their lives and achieve peace of mind that the people who mean so much to them are being cared for.
We Are Deeply Grateful
As we celebrate National Home Care Month and National Family Caregivers Awareness Month and reflect on our role as caregivers, we are deeply grateful. To the clients who trust us to enhance their quality of life. To the family caregivers who invite us to be part of their caregiving journeys. To the referral sources who introduce us to the people who will bring us joy. And to our FirstLight team members, the people who live out our Culture of Care, who inspire us and who personify what it means to be a caregiver.
We’re Here for You
Being caregivers means we’re always here to support our clients’ independence and help lighten the load for family caregivers. If you have a question about caregiving or need advice, use our Just Ask FirstLight service to connect to an expert.
We Want to Hear Your Stories
Caregivers – whether professionals or family members – have an unspoken bond. And stories about caregiving inspire us all to do what we do. We’d love to hear about what being a caregiver means to you. Share your stories in the comments."
137,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/caring-for-a-loved-one-with-parkinsons-disease/,"April is Parkinson’s Awareness Month
Parkinson’s is an incurable, progressive neurological disease that primarily affects movement, but it can also affect cognition. Because of its progression, it can be difficult to care for someone with the disease. We have curated some helpful tips to support family caregivers who are caring for a loved one living with Parkinson’s.
Understand the disease and the person living with Parkinson’s. There are special challenges when caring for someone with Parkinson’s because every day can present something new.
- The incidence and severity of Parkinson’s disease symptoms vary from day to day and even from one time of day to another. It takes skill and patience to know when to assist with a task and when to simply allow the person more time to do the task independently.
- It takes time and ongoing education to learn the many symptoms of Parkinson’s and the medication regimens that offer the most symptom relief and improve quality of life.
- Caregivers must closely observe the person with Parkinson’s overtime to detect and respond to subtle changes in motor function and mood.
- Your loved one might not be aware of his or her changing abilities. Understanding of health risks, such as falling, may not have “caught up” to their actual level of risk and impairment.
Continue to build your strength. It is important that caregivers stay fit. A caregiver could be required to provide physical care to someone with advanced Parkinson’s to help with re-positioning, walking or bathing. This responsibility can be difficult, exhausting, and even cause physical injury.
Streamline your processes when it comes to personal care. If you are providing bathing assistance:
- Use a shower chair, hand-held hose and a long-handled sponge or scrubbing brush.
- Use sponges with soap inside or a soft soap applicator instead of bar soap.
- Use lukewarm water, as very hot water can cause fatigue.
- Sew straps on towels to make them easier to hold while drying.
- Put a non-skid rug on the floor outside the tub to prevent slipping.
Dressing someone living with Parkinson’s can be time and labor-intensive. If you are providing dressing assistance:
- Allow plenty of time in the morning as rushing may only increase stress and worsen Parkinson’s symptoms.
- If possible, wait until medications have begun to work before attempting to dress someone with Parkinson’s.
- Consider replacing buttons or zippers with Velcro fasteners. Loose-fitting clothing is often easier to get on and off.
Focus on proper nutrition. Caregivers and the loved ones in their care must eat healthy. There is no one recommended way to eat with Parkinson’s disease, but a balanced diet full of fruits and vegetables promotes health and well-being for everyone. Be aware of these potential difficulties:
- Swallowing problems may occur, so diet changes may be required. Consider softening food.
- Constipation can occur. More fluids and more fiber can help maintain regularity.
- Medications that treat Parkinson’s disease can cause dehydration. Not only can dehydration result in fatigue, but over time, it can also lead to confusion, balance issues, weakness and kidney problems.
Encourage regular mobility. Falls are common and disabling in people with Parkinson’s disease, affecting up to 60% of those who live at home. Try to include some form of easy-to-manage physical activity each day, such as walking, light housekeeping, cooking or gardening. When mobility and balance become an issue, add canes and walkers to help your loved one get around and maintain some independence.
Take care of yourself. Caregivers tend to focus on their loved one and their needs but do not find time each day for themselves. Be realistic about your experience, needs, and limits. Make sure you’re building a support network, recognizing stressors that are impacting your health, and asking for help from family members or local professionals when necessary.
Don’t minimize the need for respite care. Caregiving is a demanding job, and if you’re caring for someone at the expense of taking care of yourself, it could lead to unintended consequences. Not paying attention to your personal happiness and fulfillment can create resentment over time as you continue to put others’ priorities ahead of your own.
During this time, please know that we are fully operational and our caregivers are available to help. The safety and well-being of our caregivers, clients and community have always been our top priority. That’s why we have taken extra care to provide our team with the most up-to-date safety information and training to keep everyone protected and healthy during this uncertain time.

138,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/caring-for-adults-with-disabilities/,"March is National Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month, a time to raise awareness about developmental disabilities, teach the importance of inclusion and show that a successful life is possible.
FirstLight Home Care is proud to advocate for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and we are honored to provide the assistance adults with disabilities need to live safe, fulfilling lives.
More than 5 million Americans are estimated to have a developmental disability. Many of them need support with life activities such as self-care, mobility and independent living. FirstLight provides compassionate home care to help adults with disabilities achieve the independence they desire and enable them to engage side-by-side with others in their communities.
Our caregivers can help enhance the quality of life for your loved one through a variety of personal and companion care services, including:
- Companionship
- Light housekeeping and laundry
- Shopping and errands
- Transportation
- Bathing, hygiene and continence care
- Walking and mobility
- Transfer and posture
- Meal preparation and eating assistance
- Respite Care for family caregivers
There are several organizations that provide leadership, support and education to individuals with disabilities and the families who care for them:
The American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD) is a group of community leaders providing global direction in the field of intellectual and developmental disabilities. The organization is focused on enhancing the capacity of professionals who work with individuals with disabilities and on promoting the progress of a society that fully includes individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
The Arc is the largest national community-based organization advocating for and serving people of all ages with intellectual and developmental disabilities, as well as their families. The group supports people with disabilities and their full inclusion and participation in the community through public policy efforts, education and activism, local chapter services and more.
The mission of the Developmental Disabilities Resource Center (DDRCO) is to create opportunities for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families so that they may participate fully in the community. The DDRC provides a variety of family support services, adult vocational programs, residential services for adults and self-determination initiatives.
The National Association of Councils on Developmental Disabilities (NACDD) receives federal funding to support programs that promote self-determination, integration and inclusion for all people in the United States with developmental disabilities. The NACDD drives a national public policy agenda, advocates for employment opportunities and serves as an advisor to conscientious companies, expanding overall visibility for developmental disabilities.
FirstLight Home Care helps adults with disabilities and their families regain independence, as well as face the challenges in their daily lives by providing compassionate non-medical home care. We help with everyday activities such as bathing and personal hygiene, meal preparation and eating, light housekeeping and laundry. We also offer Respite Care, giving family caregivers a much-needed break from their own caregiving role, and Travel Companion Services that assist individuals while traveling."
139,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/caring-for-aging-parents/,"Are you jeopardizing your own financial future and health by taking care of your aging parents? If you’re in the sandwich generation, your kids may be in college or thinking about going to college in the near future. You’d like to retire someday yourself, but your 401K is not as hefty as you’d like. You’re also hoping to collect your own Social Security.
This is the predicament many of the sandwich generation and baby boomers face.
At FirstLight Home Care, we know it’s not about the money … caregiving for your parents is a labor of love, a payback for all the hard work and sacrifices they made in raising you and your siblings.
You’re Not Alone
According to the Pew Research Center , nearly 40 percent of American adults are caring for someone with a significant health issue, up from 30 percent in 2010. And studies from the National Alliance for Caregiving and the MetLife Mature Market Institute reveal that those who care for an older family member are more likely to have poor health themselves in addition to shortchanging their own financial future.
You’re a Caregiver
If you’re a caregiver, you know the stresses of trying to juggle work, home and your extended family. According to a study by AARP, the average caregiver is female, 49-years-old, works outside the home, and spends almost 20 hours a week providing unpaid care to her mother or father for nearly five years.
You probably haven’t added up the cost.
A 2011 study from MetLife predicts that a female caregiver who leaves the work force to care for a parent will lose, on average, more than $324,000 in wages and Social Security and pension benefits over a lifetime.
Here’s some financial tips to think about when it comes to the costs of taking care of your aging parents:
- Take advantage of any benefits from Medicare and Medicaid. Medicaid does cover some stays in assisted living and Medicare will cover some rehabilitative costs on a short-term basis. Some states offer programs that use a Medicaid waiver to allow direct federal payments to family caregivers for their services.
- Your parents could pay you for helping to care for them. It is important to have a caregiver contract in place, so it is not seen as a gift. Giving you a gift could later hurt their chances of qualifying for Medicaid. You need to pay tax on your earnings and your parents must show the monies they have paid to you on their tax forms. For more information, go to AARP.
- Take out a long term care policy on yourself, and if it’s not too late, your parents. Read the policy carefully because some plans offer a cash benefit that may enable them to pay you or an in-home caregiver for home assistance. Also, consider having a life insurance policy on your parents to help defray their funeral costs.
- Can you declare your parent as a dependent on your income taxes? They don’t have to live with you – you just need to provide 50% of their basic living expenses. There is some fine print though – your parent’s earnings cannot exceed the deduction amount.
- Are you a Veteran? Research their Aid and Assistance program.
- The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 allows many people to take up to 12 weeks off of work, without pay, to care for a family member without fear of losing their job.
- Hire a home care agency such as FirstLight Home Care. This can be an affordable option that can also help save your sanity!
Unfortunately, there is no great solution for how to meet the financial obligations for three generations. It involves some tough conversation, adhering to a strict budget, and leaning on family and friends for support. At FirstLight Home Care, we’re here to help with in home caregiving any way we can!"
140,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/caring-for-elder-orphans/,"The rise of “elder orphans” has been dramatic in recent years. If you’re not familiar with the term, it refers to individuals who are aging alone, without a spouse or children to depend on for elder care.
In fact, according to a study presented at the Annual Scientific Meeting of the American Geriatric Society, around 22% of older adults are elder orphans and considered “at-risk.” This number is expected to rise, presenting unique challenges to this group, including concerns about who will care for them and whether they can remain at home.
Why Are Elder Orphans on the Rise?
There are many reasons behind the increase in the elder orphan population. Some include the rise in the country’s divorce rate, childless marriages and families having fewer children than in past decades. For instance, in 2020 alone, the U.S. birth rate dropped by 4%.
This trend is expected to continue. For instance, an AARP Public Policy report titled “Valuing the Invaluable” stated that there were 7.2 potential family caregivers for every person 80 and older in 2010. That number is projected to fall to 4 for every 1 by 2030 and could sink to 3 to every 1 by 2050.
Other reasons for the expanding elder orphan population include children or spouses passing away, leaving individuals alone. And some individuals simply never married by choice without planning for future elder care or for how to age in place safely.
What Can Elder Orphans Do?
Being alone can cause a deep level of stress for elder orphans as they wonder who will care for them when they need help. What can those without support do?
When it comes to certain issues like legal guardianship, solo agers must have the proper documents in place, including a healthcare proxy and other directives. These documents lay the groundwork for the individual who will take over personal finances and other needs when or if the elder orphan is no longer able to make decisions on their own. It can be a friend, family member or even a legal professional.
There are also support groups available in increasing numbers as this problem is a growing one. For instance, there are private groups on Facebook to support elder orphans. Members can ask questions related to legal and financial issues, elder care, housing, transportation, public policy and more.
If you’re concerned about aging alone, it might be time to consider moving to an assisted living community. There, you’ll be able to live with as much independence as possible. You’ll also be part of a community where you can meet others, socialize and ensure help is always nearby.
If, however, you’re like many individuals and want to age in place at home, a company like FirstLight® Home Care can provide a wide range of elder care services. We can work with you to personalize a plan and schedule that meets your needs and preferences. This way, you can remain where you’re happiest and most comfortable, while also getting the extra support you need.
How Our Elder Care Services Help
Are you moving a little slower these days? Are you having a hard time getting out of bed or bathing on your own? Are you having trouble getting to the grocery store or preparing meals? For many adults over the age of 65, activities like these start to become a challenge. While you cherish your independence and naturally want to take care of yourself, sometimes you need a caregiver to help in certain ways.
At FirstLight Home Care, we can provide the right mix of elder care services. We offer professional and carefully trained caregivers who can help as you navigate this new journey. We can provide non-medical support, such as assistance with bathing and dressing, with mobility, transportation, meal preparation and medication reminders.

Earlier this year, Veterans Affairs officials agreed to a set of 12 recommendations that are meant to assist family caregivers of veterans with things like including caregivers in medical check-ups, creating new training and support services and expanding research into their challenges. Read more about these recommendations.
Because of the work we do in non-medical home care and the services we provide to military caregivers and their loved ones, a couple of these recommendations stood out to us:
- Recommendation 6: Conduct a thorough analysis of the need for respite care resources and their availability.
- Recommendation 8: Improve training for caregivers and include them in veterans’ medical planning from day one.
At FirstLight Home Care, we are proud to have a CEO who is so focused on caring for our military veterans and their families. Jeff Bevis is continuing an ongoing dialog to ensure that resources and assistance in respite care, as well as family caregiver training, are available for our nation’s 5.5 million military caregivers.
Jeff is a leader in VetFran and currently serves as committee chairman of the International Franchise Association (IFA) Education Foundation VetFran Committee, which helps provide access and opportunities in both employment and franchising for veterans and their spouses. Jeff is also a key contributor in discussions with The Elizabeth Dole Foundation, an organization that works with leaders in the public, private, nonprofit and faith communities to recognize military caregivers’ service and promote their well-being.
What we can do as a home care company is to offer respite care that gives family members and other loved ones who are primary caregivers a break from the demands of their own caregiving responsibilities. We can also work with families to help them navigate some of the complexities when it comes to the caregiving needs, health care benefits and resources of their veteran loved ones.
Jeff previously shared these insights in a piece about the growing crisis of veteran family caregivers:
Families often struggle to provide care for their wounded warriors. It’s not just a function of the increasing number of veterans needing care. A major contributing factor is the increasing complexity of veteran needs being faced by the family caregivers. Today’s veterans needing care are returning from deployments with traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at record levels. Coupled with an aging Veterans Affairs (VA) care system that struggles to keep up with demand, family caregivers face unrelenting pressure to try to do more for their veterans.
Family caregivers can struggle with the mental health needs of their loved ones who suffer from the challenges of TBIs or PTSD. Meanwhile, the VA system strains to keep up with the sheer volume of veterans now in the system with World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War and Iraq and Afghanistan veterans all seeking care and treatment.
There are many costs related to caregiving, both financial and personal. Families are torn on an economic front trying to make ends meet, juggling the dual full-time pressures of work and care while searching for the right alternatives to address the needs of their veteran family members. This generates stress and friction between parents and adult children, and between veterans and their spouses, as they struggle with issues related to home accessibility, functionality and the mobility of veterans.
To cope, families can start by learning as much as they can about the VA health care system. Caregivers should investigate the aid and attendant benefits that every veteran who served at least one day in wartime is entitled to but, sadly, might never have been told about.

142,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/caring-for-the-caregiver/,"I’m excited to introduce you to LeAnn Thieman, co-author of Chicken Soup for the Caregiver’s Soul. She has provided a great guest post for our readers about caring for the caregiver.
Strong bonds between family members are crucial to any healthy relationship. However, caregivers often require additional support from family members as they carry both the young and older relatives on their shoulders. LeAnn does a great job of offering advice to help care for the caregiver in your family.
Terry stacks the breakfast dishes into the sink, hands the freshly-packed lunchboxes to her son and daughter, bundles them into their coats and boots and hustles them to the school bus. With a smile and a wave she promises, “I’ll pick you up after school. We’ll make Christmas cookies for your Girl Scout meeting then go to your basketball game.”
She scurries back into the house to spoon-feed one more before leaving for her part-time job. After wiping his hands and face, she kisses his nose, helps him into the car, buckles him in, and drives him to daycare. Hugging him, she promises, “I’ll pick you up at lunchtime, Dad.” With a vacant look in his eyes he asks, “But what about breakfast?”
Terry is one of the 54 million Americans caring for a family member. Over 40% of families who provide care for an elder have children at home under the age of eighteen. Seventy-five percent of caregivers are women. Part of the “sandwich generation,” many will spend more years caring for a parent than they will raising a child. Not only are they ministering to their parents and children, many are caring for their children’s children. From 1990-2000, the number of kids living with grandparents increased 30%.
Alarmingly, women who care for grandchildren have a 55% greater risk of heart disease. Caregivers of someone with a chronic illness have a 63% chance of dying early. It’s no wonder caregivers often experience troublesome feelings such as depression, resentment, worry, helplessness, exhaustion, guilt, anger, and sadness with reversal of parent-child roles. But when caregivers care for themselves, these statistics and severe emotions can be drastically reduced.
Caregiving depletes a person not only physically, but also emotionally and spiritually. Because 25% of the world population is caring for someone, we all know a person in a caregiving role.
Here are 12 easy tips for you to help care for that caregiver:
- Extend compassion and empathy first.
- Encourage them to care for themselves as attentively as they do another. Remind them to get regular checkups, to eat properly, exercise, and get adequate sleep.
- Suggest they take time out for themselves and use relaxation or stress management techniques such as meditation, visualization, biofeedback and yoga.
- Advise them to pay attention to their own feelings and emotions and to seek counseling and support groups if needed.
- Listen.
- Help them to stay actively involved with friends and hobbies.
- Assist them in finding respite care so they can regularly take time for themselves.
- Subscribe them to supportive caregiving periodicals and magazines and gift them with spiritual, inspirational, encouraging books.
- Help them tap into community-based and national resources for support. The Area Agency on Aging, www.loaa.org. is great places to start and www.strengthforcaring.com is an online comprehensive resource for caregivers.
- Deliver a heat-and-eat meal.
- Offer to sit with their loved one, even for 30 minutes, so they can take a bubble bath or a walk.
- Tell them how much you admire them for all they are doing.
These small efforts to care for the caregiver create a win/win/win situation. Your relationship with the caregiver will flourish; the family member will receive care from a happier, healthier caregiver; and that caregiver will feel cared for, too—a much needed and overdue reward.

143,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/caring-lonely-parent/,"Do you have a lonely parent who is struggling with feelings of isolation or depression? Are you having a hard time getting them to leave the house and enjoy social activities, especially during this festive season?
With age comes an increased risk of loneliness and social isolation. And it can be even more prevalent in seniors who either cannot or do not want to leave their home. This can be problematic for seniors because loneliness can often result in depression and ultimately additional health problems.
There are several factors that may be keeping your lonely parent somewhat secluded and feeling down:
- They are no longer able to drive, and they must rely on others to take them where they need or want to go. Some are reluctant to ask for help with transportation, so they don’t get out and socialize with others. This can also be harmful if their pride is causing them to also miss health check-ups and follow-up appointments.
- They have physical limitations, such as chronic pain or mobility issues, and thus have difficulty getting around.
- They have poor vision or hearing and simply don’t feel comfortable being in noisy places with a lot of people.
- They may be battling depression or anxiety and are unable to leave their home.
- If your parent is on a fixed income, they may be worried about the potential cost of social activities and prefer not to spend any extra money.
What You Can Do to Help Your Lonely Parent
Feeling alone and sad much of the time does not need to be a normal part of the aging process. There are ways you can help your lonely parent feel more connected to friends, family and their community, and possibly combat depression and loneliness.
Just visit…virtually if you must. Even more so today, there are widening geographic distances between seniors and their families. And if you live far away, you might not realize that your loved one has become isolated. They may feel embarrassed or too proud to admit they’re lonely. If you don’t live close to Mom or Dad, you can still visit with them either on the phone or through text, Facetime or Skype. Social media is also a great way to stay up-to-date on family happenings, and it’s easy to share photos.
Be aware. Pay close attention to times that may prompt loneliness, such as the holidays or anniversaries of births and deaths. Stay connected and keep in touch more often during those difficult times.
Keep them active. Encourage parents to get involved in activities outside of the home if they are able, such as a participating in a hobby they enjoy, a senior exercise class (SilverSneakers is a great place to start), adult education classes or a volunteer opportunity. Staying active also can mean regular visits with friends to have lunch, take a walk or just talk. A local senior center may be a great place to start as most offer regular group activities, organized games and social get-togethers.
Ask for nearby support. Talk to neighbors and let them know about your parent’s living situation. Ask neighbors to check in with your parent from time to time. Put together a phone list of those nearby, and provide them with your contact information in case of an emergency.
Consider companion care. FirstLight Home Care offers senior companion care services that include regular visits, conversation and company, medication reminders, meal preparation, shopping, transportation and more. This can provide much-needed peace of mind for families who do not live close to their elderly loved one.
If you’re interested in learning more about our senior companion care services, contact the FirstLight office nearest you. Our local teams can help answer your questions and assist in navigating the challenges that often come with family caregiving."

There are just under 2 million World War II veterans remaining in the U.S., and they are aging quickly.
Many members of the “Greatest Generation” who are dealing with the challenges of advancing age need care and assistance with activities of daily living. Home care can be an ideal solution to help older veterans receive exceptional care and maintain the quality of life they deserve.
Home care services assist veterans in a variety of ways. These offerings can include: professional companion care, such as conversation and company, as well as household duties like cooking, cleaning and laundry; and non-medical personal care, like help with individual needs such as bathing and hygiene, continence and toileting care, mobility support and assistance with eating. Home care also can assist veterans of any age living with injuries sustained in the field, as well as active-duty families that need help when loved ones are deployed.
These home care services can be applied in various settings:
- Veterans can receive companion care or personal care in their own homes
- Care can be provided in independent and assisted living communities and skilled nursing facilities
- Respite care can be offered to family caregivers so that they may take time off from the responsibility of caring for their loved one.
A Lesser-Known VA Benefit
Wartime service veterans and their surviving spouses are eligible for VA pensions. One little-known existing benefit is the Veterans Aid & Attendance Pension, which helps reduce the cost of care for older veterans and surviving spouses.
Aid & Attendance is available to eligible veterans and spouses who require home care – including assistance with eating, bathing and medication reminders – even if the assistance is not a direct result of a service-related injury.
If you are caring for a veteran of the United States Armed Forces, make sure that your loved one is receiving the care and benefits they deserve. FirstLight provides non-medical home care under the Aid & Attendance program, as well as companion and personal care services to anyone 18 years of age and older who may need assistance.
Are you caring for a family member of the “Greatest Generation?” What are some of the challenges you face providing care for your veteran loved one? Comment here or head over to our Facebook page to join the conversation.
And don’t forget that November 11 is Veteran’s Day. Please take the time to salute and thank a veteran for their services to the United States."

Over twenty-two million Americans are affected by cataracts, resulting in an annual estimated cataract treatment cost of $6.8 billion. (Source: Friends for Sight, 2017) FirstLight Home Care wants you to take care of your eyes and to be aware that you can help protect yourself from cataracts by understanding the disease and being proactive on how to prevent it.
A cataract is a clouding of the eye’s lens that leads to decreased vision. Any interference with the eye’s lens impacts how it focuses images onto the retina at the back of the eye. If left untreated, cataracts can lead to decreased vision.
The are many risk factors for developing cataracts including: diabetes, prolonged exposure to sunlight, tobacco use and alcohol consumption. The good news is that impaired vision from cataracts can be restored by surgically removing the affected lens, and replacing it with an artificial one.
While 50 percent of those over age 80 have cataracts, studies have shown that the risk for cataract development can be prevented.
To reduce your risk of becoming a cataract statistics, Ophthalmologists recommend these simple actions you can take today to keep your vision sharp:
- See your eye doctor regularly – typically once per year
- Protect your eyes from the sun to reduce ultraviolet exposure by wearing sunglasses when outdoors
- Quit smoking, better yet, don’t start smoking
- Minimize your alcohol consumption
- Keep your diabetes under control
- Eat right. Eat lots of leafy greens and foods high in antioxidants, such as beta-carotene, selenium and vitamins C and E
There is lots to see in this world! No matter what your age, you should be active in protecting your eyes so that you will have a lifetime of great vision. Find a local Ophthalmologist near you."

In a 1988 proclamation, Ronald Reagan, who was the U.S. president at the time, created a national day for senior citizens. Still today, National Senior Citizens Day is annually observed on August 21.
The observance was established to recognize and support senior citizens who make a positive impact in communities across the U.S. It also was created to raise awareness of the social, health and economic issues that affect senior citizens.
“For all they have achieved throughout life and for all they continue to accomplish, we owe older citizens our thanks and a heartfelt salute. We can best demonstrate our gratitude and esteem by making sure that our communities are good places in which to mature and grow older — places in which older people can participate to the fullest and can find the encouragement, acceptance, assistance, and services they need to continue to lead lives of independence and dignity.”
~ President Ronald Reagan – August 19, 1988 Proclamation 5847
Many communities celebrate Senior Citizens Day with events, activities and special gatherings for senior citizens, their families, friends and volunteers. Some businesses, such as retail stores and restaurants, offer discounts or special promotions to seniors on or around August 21.
Whether you have a senior in your life or not, there are many ways you can celebrate:
Just visit. Spend time with the senior citizens you know and tell them how much they are loved and appreciated. Sometimes providing simple companionship and conversation can lift spirits and reduce loneliness. If parents or grandparents live out of town, video chatting is a great way to stay connected. Encourage your tech-savvy senior to use Skype or Facetime instead of the phone.
Volunteer. Some seniors may not have friends or family close by. You can volunteer at a retirement home and spend time with those who may not otherwise get a visitor.
Plan a family night in. Schedule time for the family to watch a movie or play a board game with your senior loved one so that everyone – from grandkids to grandparents – can spend time together.
Plan a fun outing. If your senior can be out and about, take them to lunch or dinner, see a movie or play, or surprise them by participating in their favorite hobby, whether it’s bowling, playing cards or cooking. A little physical activity can have a big impact on their health and well-being.
Learn your family history. Talk to your senior loved ones about their memories and life experiences. Learn about their time growing up, seek their wisdom and advice, and start gathering family stories. Consider collecting old photos and even documenting your conversations on video.
At FirstLight, we help seniors enjoy the best quality of life for as long as possible by sending caregivers into homes to assist with services such as Companion Care.

196,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/celebrate-parkinson-awareness-month/,"Muhammed Ali who floated like a butterfly in the boxing ring gave a face to the disease. Did he give up? No. He lit the Olympic Torch in 1996.
Michael J Fox battles it too, yet he has his own successful sitcom and has raised more than $450 million in research to bring about a cure.
These are just two people among the 1.5 million Americans who battle Parkinson’s disease yet lead rich and fulfilling lives. April Is Parkinson’s Awareness Month, a time to educate people about this illness and the many misconceptions that surround it. It’s also time to applaud those who valiantly fight the illness and live with its crippling side effects.
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological condition. Its onset is gradual, often starting with a tremor in the hand. Parkinson’s disease is the second most common degenerative disease behind Alzheimer’s disease. Although it’s not considered fatal, victims can succumb to complications with swallowing that can cause choking.
What Are The Symptoms?
Some symptoms of Parkinson’s can even appear 10 years before a, accurate diagnosis is made. Symptoms may even come and go initially and may include:
- Trembling in the hands, legs, arms, trunk
- Rigidity or stiffness of the legs and trunk
- Slowness of movement or gait
- Impaired balance and coordination
- Slurred speech
- Problems with writing
Other less common symptoms are constipation, loss of smell, heavy excessive sweating, and acting out your dreams at night.
What Are the Risk Factors?
- Age. Very rarely are young people diagnosed with Parkinson’s. It usually begins in mid-50s, but is most common among people age 60 or older.
- Heredity. If anyone in your immediate family has Parkinson’s disease, your risk factors increase. In the past 10 years, researchers have identified a number of rare instances where Parkinson’s disease appears to be caused by a single genetic mutation. In these cases, the mutated gene is passed from generation to generation.
- Sex. Men are more likely to develop Parkinson’s disease than women.
- Exposure to herbicide or pesticides
How Is Parkinson’s Diagnosed?
Unfortunately, there is not test to confirm Parkinson’s disease which is why it is often misdiagnosed. A neurologist is often the type of physician you should visit and will ask for your medical history, evaluate your symptoms, and conduct a neurological and physical examination.
In 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a specialized imaging technique called DaTscan that allows doctors to capture detailed pictures of the dopamine system in your brain. This test by itself cannot diagnose Parkinson’s but has gone a long way in helping doctors confirm it.
He/she may also give you a Parkinson’s medication called carbidopa-levodopaion. Significant improvement with this medication will often confirm your diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. Due to the lack of definitive testing for the illness, it may take time to accurately diagnose this illness.
What Is Being Done
The most common drug at this time is carbidopa-levodopaion, which is a natural chemical that passes into your brain and is converted to dopamine. Other medications include dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors, Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors, anticholinergics, and Amantadine. Medications may greatly reduce many of these symptoms, although reactions and side effects to the medication vary from person to person. Your doctor may suggest exercises to keep you as mobile as possible to increase your muscle strength, flexibility and balance.
If you do not respond to medication, surgery may be suggested. A therapy called deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a procedure in which electrodes are implanted into the brain and connected to a small electrical device called a pulse generator that can be externally programmed. The surgery can reduce the need for levodopa and related drugs and the involuntary movements that are a common side effect of levodopa. It also helps to alleviate tremors, slowness of movements, and gait problems.
For further informational about Parkinson ’s disease, you can check out these resources:
- American Parkinson Disease Association
- National Parkinson Foundation
- Parkinson Alliance
- Michael J Fox’s Foundation for Parkinson’s Research
- Parkinson’s Action Network
- Parkinson’s Resource Organization
At FirstLight Home Care, we have no cure for the disease, nor any way to prevent its ruthless progression, but we can make your life easier. We can help you with daily activities such as dressing, eating, bathing and writing — which can be difficult for people with Parkinson’s disease. In addition to a supportive hand, we can provide a compassionate ear, helping you to understand what you can do versus can’t do."

198,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/celebrating-dad-this-fathers-day/,"Father’s Day is a special day for dads. It’s a day to let them know how much we love them and value their place in our lives. Even if we are all grown up now, father’s day represents our appreciation for all the long talks, late night homework help, summer tree house projects, and Boy Scout meetings or daddy-daughter dances throughout the years. It is important to make your dad feel appreciated on his special day. Here are some fun ideas and gift suggestions for Father’s Day this Sunday:
Give him something he is passionate about
Give your dad a gift that pertains to one of his hobbies. For example, if he’s an avid fisherman, give him some tackle specific to the fish in local streams or rivers. If your dad enjoys grilling, treat him to a unique grilling gadget he would never get himself. A great website that offers specialty outdoor cooking tools is Sur La Table. Giving a gift that supports his passions lets him know that you are listening to his interests and gives him a gift he is sure to use!
Treat Dad to a great meal
Whether it is a home-made dish, a favorite restaurant or even just a beer during the game, make your dad feel loved with a special treat he will enjoy. It is a guarantee that every dad will appreciate a great meal!
Spend quality time with your dad on Sunday
This is the best gift of all. Whether it’s breakfast in bed or a round of golf, dad will cherish the time that you spend together. If possible, dedicate the majority of the day to your dad this Sunday and get the whole family involved!
Whatever you chose to do on Sunday, remember that the time you spend together is most important. Have a great Father’s Day!"
199,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/celebrating-fathers-day-for-grandpa/,"Father’s Day is June 17. This year, make it all about Grandpa. Get the kids involved and treat your dad or grandpa to a day that he will always remember. Having trouble thinking beyond golf tees and “#1 Grandpa” mugs? Check out these ideas to make Grandpa’s day:
Make a Father’s Day craft. Help your kids make an age-appropriate craft to give to their grandpa. He’ll love anything handmade: from a painting of the family to a clay model of his favorite chair.
Get outside. If your dad or grandpa is an outdoorsy type, take a day to go for a hike, go fishing or rent a canoe. Take lots of pictures on your day out to save as a keepsake.
Surprise him. If Grandpa lives far away, surprise him with a visit. Bring dinner for the whole family and let him spend time with the grandkids without having to travel.
Book a vacation. If your grandpa needs a break, send him on a weekend or week-long vacation somewhere he will enjoy. Or book a vacation for the whole family for a fun family getaway.
Give him a call. If visiting or gifts aren’t options, give your dad or grandpa a call to remind him that you care. He’ll appreciate the sentiment and will love talking to the grandkids."
200,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/celebrating-fathers-day-with-seniors/,"Your father has been a rock and a role model. He’s been there for you through the good days and the bad; for the joy, laughter and tears. But now as he’s getting older, he needs some extra support and attention from you. How can you honor him in a special way this Father’s Day?
After months of shutdowns and social isolation, this is the year to make Father’s Day extra memorable. Here are a few different ways you can show your gratitude and love for that one-of-a-kind father in your life.
Ideas for Father’s Day for the Active Senior
If your dad is active and enjoys going out, plan a barbecue or lunch in his honor. Serve his favorite foods and invite the whole family over for time together. During the day, you can plan fun and games, like bocce ball, corn hole, lawn bowling or horseshoes. It’s the perfect way to spend quality time with your dad and your whole family, making happy memories in the process.
If your dad likes arts and culture, consider going to his favorite museum, art gallery or a well-known landmark. There are even attractions where dads get in free on Father’s Day. If he’s not able to walk for long, there are plenty of places to visit virtually, from the Guggenheim Museum in New York to the British Museum in London. You can even take virtual tours of national parks, like Yellowstone.
If he prefers nature, you can simply go for a walk in the park or through the neighborhood. If he’s more comfortable sitting, you can even take him on a long car ride through a local scenic area and then invite him for lunch or dinner at a restaurant he enjoys.
If your dad prefers sports or cars, take him to a local game or car show. This is a fun-filled, exciting way to spend the day together doing an activity he’s passionate about. Your dad will also appreciate the opportunity to get out of the house, socialize with others and reminisce about his own memories growing up.
Ideas for Father’s Day for the Stay-at-Home Senior
If you have a father who’s confined to his home or a senior living community, you can still have a special day together. Just make sure you’re following any distancing rules or visiting requirements if you’re spending time in his community.
One idea is to plan a movie afternoon with him. Bring snacks he enjoys and watch his favorite movie, whether it’s a black and white classic or something more recent. If there is a game on TV he wants to see, plan to watch that together instead.
If your dad loves poker, chess or another game, plan a game day with a few close family members. Use pennies or other small tokens for bets to keep it competitive yet still light-hearted and fun. You can then order out if he’s at home or bring him his favorite takeout meal if he’s in an assisted living community. Check out these special food deals to take advantage of this Father’s Day.
If your dad likes to get pampered, take him for an old-fashioned cut and shave. For seniors, the simple tasks – like grooming and shaving – can be difficult. When you take him to the barber, he’ll walk out looking and feeling better. It will also provide an opportunity for your dad to relax and spend time with you.
Ideas for Father’s Day Gifts from the Family
In addition to different activities, there are a range of thoughtful gifts to consider. Depending on his hobbies and interests, some ideas include:
- A new deck of cards in large print
- Books or movies, or a subscription for audiobooks or music
- A comfortable new blanket and slippers
- A photo album filled with family pictures
- A basket full of his favorite things, from treats and candies to drawings and cards from children and grandchildren
Ideas for Father’s Day with the Grandkids
If you or your siblings have children, there are many ways to get your kids involved so they can honor their grandfather or great-grandfather on Father’s Day. One idea is to purchase a kite kit and build it together. There are loads of kits available with creative designs, from dragons and butterflies to sailboats and more.
This is a great way to get your dad involved with the kids, so they spend quality time together. It will provide a fun-filled afternoon and you can then all go outside afterward and enjoy a day of play.
Another way to get your children involved is to fill out a “Fun Facts About Grandpa” printable with your child. There are different options available online that provide prompts for your child to write what they love most about their grandpa, their favorite memory, and things their grandpa has taught them. It will surely warm your dad’s heart and even bring him a laugh.
Ideas for Father’s Day if You’re Away
If you are not able to see your dad in-person this Father’s Day, make sure you schedule a video chat. Get the whole family involved and participating, talking about special memories you all have of him and how much you care about and appreciate him.
Whatever you decide to do, keep in mind any limitations your dad has. While you want to have fun and do things he enjoys, it will be a difficult day if he’s struggling. So, choose things that are easy for him and that he likes best. Simply spending time with your dad and creating new memories together is what’s truly most important.
Whether your dad lives at home or in a senior living community, FirstLight® Home Care can provide the extra support, comfort and assistance he needs on Father’s Day and every day of the year. Contact your local FirstLight Home Care today to find out more."
201,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/celebrating-grandparents-day-year/,"How will you be celebrating Grandparents Day this year? It’s officially September 11 this year and it’s the perfect time to participate in some fun activities with the grandparents in your family. It’s also an opportunity to become involved with grandparents who may not be able to travel or see their own grandchildren and include them in your activities. Some communities will be hosting events and special activities for grandparents, and many care facilities will be doing the same for their residents.
A good place to start is the National Grandparents Day website, where you can learn about the woman who started it all, Marian McQuade, in 1978. This website has a wealth of information that can get you started.
If you are thinking about gathering the grandkids and grandparents at your home for a celebration, here are some ideas to get your creative juices flowing:
Have the grandchildren learn a favorite recipe and make it together
A great way to strengthen bonds is over food. What were your favorite dishes from your childhood? See if your mom would like to share her recipes with your kids and prepare an “heirloom” meal together.
Have grandparents teach the grandchildren something they are good at
Kids love to find out what their grandparents’ special talents are and try them out too. Was grandpa a baseball player? Was grandma good at juggling? There are so many things kids don’t know about their grandparents and this is a great way to have them enjoy time together.
Create memories together with a time capsule or memory box
Remember the old days when you were in elementary school and your class created a time capsule with items from current times? You can do the same thing but use favorite memories instead. Fill a container with fun things like baby pictures of both grandparents and grandchildren. Put items that remind everyone of good times over the years, and place it somewhere it can be retrieved later on.
Find additional resources that can give you ideas for celebrating Grandparent’s Day this year by just searching “Grandparents Day 2016” online. If you need loving care for a grandparent or parent in your life, contact FirstLight Home Care for more information about our companion and caregiving services."

Although we regularly recognize our FirstLight caregivers, we make a special point of doing so on this special day.
Dedicated home care, home health and hospice professionals selflessly care for others each and every day.

Caregivers will continue to make a big difference in the lives of others. There are simple ways we can honor them.
- Say “thank you” to a caregiver you know.
- Show your appreciation with a small gift or a note of gratitude.
- Simply share words of encouragement and support for all they do.

“Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around.”

This week-long campaign, started by the International Council on Active Aging®, challenges society’s outlook on aging by showing that, regardless of age or health conditions, adults over 50 can live a full life in all areas, including physical, social, spiritual, emotional, intellectual, vocational and environmental.
The purpose of this annual health observance is to give older adults the means to experience wellness activities and exercise in a safe, supportive environment. It also promotes the benefits of a healthier, more active lifestyle.
We have collected a few articles from our FirstLight Care blog that may help you and your loved one stay active and engaged, whether you are looking for ways to move more, ideas for improving your mental health, or tips for keeping the older adult in your life more social.

205,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/celebrating-wellderly-week/,"We read a lot in the news about exercise and nutrition regardless of your age. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the average life expectancy is 78.8 years. .. at an all-time record high. In fact, the life expectancy for females is 81.2 years; for males, it’s 76.4 years. As more and more people wait longer and longer to retire, it’s top to banish all thoughts of sitting back in a rocking chair in your 60s! It’s time to get up and exercise.
According to Dr. Richard Brassard, president of the American Chiropractic Association (ACA), ” The type of exercise and frequency depends on your health. Perhaps the most debilitating influence in people’s health as they age is a sedentary life Exercise of some type is all but mandatory.”
No one says you have to go run a marathon or run down to the gym and sign up for high impact aerobic classes. In fact, any exercise program should be started slowly and you should consult your physician first so you don’t overdo it. If you are inactive, you inevitably set yourself up for broken bones, respiratory and circulatory problems and even gastrointestinal disorders. And no one wants that.
So what type of exercise is particularly good for senior citizens? Let’s ask the experts.
- Walking. Walking is inexpensive and virtually any one can do it. It helps seniors to maintain mobility and makes you less susceptible to aneurysms or ruptures, and muscle loss. Start out slow and see if you can increase to one mile/day at least three times a week. According to American Trails, other benefits of walking include:
- Reduced risk of dying prematurely
- Decreased risk of dying from heart disease
- Decreased risk of developing colon cancer
- Reduced risk of developing high blood pressure
- Help in reducing blood pressure in people who already have high blood pressure
- Decreased risk of developing diabetes
- Lower risk of developing hypertension
- Increased muscle strength, flexibility and sense of balance, all of which reduce the risk of falls
- Help in controlling weight
- Swimming. Swimming is an ideal exercise for the aging because it’s low impact and you don’t have to worry about stumbling or falling. The beauty of swimming is it uses all muscle groups and is easy on your joints. Benefits of swimming include:
- Lowered risk of osteoporosis
- Increased flexibility
- Toned muscles
- Promotes heart health, enabling your heart to become stronger, larger, and more efficient at pumping blood throughout your body.
- Promotes mental health
- Increases energy levels
Remember, it is never too late to start exercising! And remember, it’s important to stretch before you exercise."
206,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/challenges-facing-family-caregivers/,"Caregiving for a loved one is a balancing act
Many people will become the primary caregiver of an aging parent or loved one, if they haven’t already. Caregiving is worthwhile and rewarding, but there are many challenges facing family caregivers. It becomes even more challenging if the caregiver has his or her own obligations, such as a job and children to care for, or if they must travel long distances to care for their elderly relative.
By recognizing the challenges facing many caregivers, you may be able to prepare in advance and reduce the difficulties that lie ahead. Some of the common challenges family caregivers encounter are:
Constant stress: Caregiving can be emotionally and physically demanding. Of course, you worry about your loved one and you want to make sure they are taken care of in every way possible. This worry alone can cause stress, anxiety and even exhaustion, which can all lead to health problems for you if they are not recognized and managed properly.
Time management: Because caregiving can be a full-time job, caregivers often have less time for themselves, as well as their own spouse, children, friends and other family. Sometimes they spend so much time on their duties that they can’t enjoy other things like social activities, vacations, hobbies or volunteering.
Many also struggle with balancing their work schedules around caregiving responsibilities. Tasks such as calling doctors, scheduling appointments and providing transportation need to be done during daytime hours. When you are working, it can be difficult to take on those tasks without taking time off work or rearranging your schedule.
Depression: One of the challenges facing many caregivers is depression. It’s not unusual to develop some sort of depression because of the constant demands while providing care. Additionally, many caregivers don’t maintain an active social life and they lose touch with others outside of the home. They can begin to feel disconnected from their friends and family. What makes it even more difficult is that most people don’t recognize the signs of depression within themselves, and they are embarrassed to admit how they are feeling. Finding the right family caregiver support group could be a great comfort.
Financial burden: Because most family caregivers are unpaid, they can experience some financial strain, especially when their duties take them away from a paying job. Some also spend much of their own money on expenses such as transportation, living accommodations and food, as well as on medication, services and other treatments for their loved one.
Not asking for help: I’m fine… I don’t need any help… I can do it all! Does this sound familiar? Many primary caregivers take on full-time responsibilities without asking for assistance from others, even if they have other family members close by and available to help. This can lead to worry and guilt, wondering if they are providing the best care possible, not to mention stress, burnout and potential health problems. Services such as respite care can be so important as it allows caregivers to take a break so that they can focus on themselves for a while.
If you are a primary caregiver, it is imperative that you find a balance between caregiving and your own life. Not paying attention to your personal needs and happiness can create resentment over time as you continue to put others’ priorities ahead of your own.

208,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/common-causes-of-vision-loss-in-older-adults/,"January is National Eye Care and National Glaucoma Awareness Month.
Vision changes can occur as you get older. Based on statistical data from the American Optometric Association, approximately 142 million U.S. citizens age 40 and older have vision problems.
It is important to know the most common age-related eye and vision problems, the signs and potential treatment options in order to retain good vision as you age.
GLAUCOMA is a group of eye diseases characterized by damage to the optic nerve resulting in loss of peripheral (side) vision. It often affects both eyes, typically one eye before the other. If left untreated, glaucoma can lead to total blindness. People with a family history of glaucoma, African Americans and older adults have a higher risk of developing the disease.
Glaucoma occurs when there is unusually high pressure on the optic nerve. The pressure can break down the nerve leading to blind spots. It is often painless and can have no obvious symptoms until there is a significant loss of side vision.
If you have been diagnosed with Glaucoma, treatment options may include prescription eye drops, oral medications, laser treatment, surgery or a combination of any of these.
CATARACTS are cloudy or opaque areas in the normally clear lens of the eye. Depending upon their size and location, they can interfere with normal vision. Usually, cataracts develop in both eyes, but one may be worse than the other.
Cataracts occur at the clear lens in front of the eyeball and can cause blurry vision, decreased contrast sensitivity, inability to see in low-light conditions (such as when driving at night), dulling of colors and increased sensitivity to glare.
If you have been diagnosed with Cataracts, the most common treatment is surgery to remove the clouded lens. In many cases, the affected lens is replaced with a clear, plastic intraocular lens.
AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD) is an eye disease that affects the macula (the center of the light-sensitive retina at the back of the eye), resulting in central vision loss. The macula is the part of the retina that allows us to see fine detail and colors. Activities like reading, driving, watching TV and recognizing faces all require good central vision provided by the macula. While macular degeneration decreases central vision, peripheral or side vision typically remains unaffected.
AMD affects the middle of your vision causing a blurry, dark patch directly in your line of sight, and overall foggy appearance to what is seen, and what appears to be waves in straight objects.
If you have been diagnosed with age-related Macular Degeneration, the most common treatment is nutritional therapy with a healthy diet high in antioxidants to support the cells of macular. If more severe, anti-angiogenic drugs and laser therapy are other treatment options.
DIABETIC EYE DISEASE (OR DIABETIC RETINOPATHY) is a condition that occurs in people with diabetes and the result of progressive damage to the tiny blood vessels that nourish the retina. These damaged blood vessels leak blood and other fluids that cause retinal tissue to swell and cloud vision. The condition usually affects both eyes. The longer a person has diabetes, the greater the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy.
Instability of one’s glucose measurements over time can impact the development and/or severity of the condition. Signs include spots or dark strings floating in your vision, blurred vision, impaired color vision, or dark or empty areas in your vision. At its most severe, diabetic retinopathy can cause blindness.
If you have been diagnosed with diabetic eye disease, the most common treatment is to get blood glucose, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol levels as close to normal as possible. Laser treatment or intravitreal steroids are additional treatment options.
GET ROUTINE CHECK-UPS. It is normal for your vision to change as you age, but losing your vision is not a normal part of aging. Everyone, regardless of age, needs to safeguard their sight and get regular eye exams. If you are experiencing any changes with your vision, contact your local eye care professional as soon as possible.
At FirstLight, our caregivers are available to take you to and from your medical appointments, and if any medical treatment is required that limits your ability to live independently, we can be there with customized services to help you recover.
Call your local FirstLight® Home Care today to learn more about how we can help you live independently as you age in the place you call home."

Stephanie, with FirstLight Home Care of Omaha, was virtually recognized for her extraordinary dedication, service and integrity last week during our national conference. The Caregiver of the Year award is typically presented in person at the conference’s annual gala. However, due to COVID-19, the event took place virtually this year.
FirstLight has more than 5,000 caregivers nationwide, with Caregiver of the Year award nominations coming in from all over the country. Nominees were evaluated based on dependability, advocacy, empathy, quality of service and compassion toward clients.
“Stephanie has dedicated her life to being a caregiver because it just is a part of her,” said Jaye. “She was born with it. You can’t train that; you can’t teach that. It just has to be inside someone. Stephanie is full of love for what she does. This is not just a job to her.”
Jaye went on to say that Stephanie is intelligent, intuitive, kind, compassionate, hardworking, reliable and cheerful. And she handles every situation with impeccable grace and patience.
“This has certainly been a challenging year for us all,” said Jaye. But we are thrilled to celebrate Stephanie in any way we can. Over the summer, our CEO Jeff Bevis, along with his wife, Maribeth, drove more than 1,500 miles to visit us and to personally present this award to our Caregiver of the Year. For that, we are grateful. It really validates how much we truly do believe, from the top down, in our Culture of Care.”
Extraordinary FirstLight caregivers like Stephanie help seniors and other adults with many needs – from personal hygiene and household duties such as cooking, light housekeeping and running errands, to respite and dementia care.

211,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/connecting-with-a-person-who-has-alzheimers-disease/,"I’m excited to share another guest post with our readers today. Ellen Woodward Potts is the co-author of
and here she discusses how to connect with a loved one who has Alzheimer’s Disease and shares some of her own personal experiences.
At FirstLight, we believe if you have met one person with dementia, you’ve only met one person. That is, each individual will talk, act, remember, and behave differently, not simply because of what stage of dementia they are in, but because they are who they are.
That’s why we’ve developed a unique Dementia Program—building care around the individual, not the disease—incorporating who they were, not just who we see today. It’s a personalized and engaging approach, where our goal is to make sure those affected by this disease live the rest of their lives with purpose. You can read more about our program here. — Jeff Bevis
If you’ve seen read or seen “The Notebook,” you get an understanding of the need caregivers have to find that one moment of connection with a loved one who has Alzheimer’s disease. Perhaps the biggest loss people experience with this disease is the loss of shared memories. As time goes on, those fade, and it becomes more and more difficult to connect with the person. However, you can connect with your loved one, even into the late stage of the disease. It just takes time, some thought, some creativity and some effort.
In general, the most important thing to remember is that you must ENTER THE WORLD of the person with Alzheimer’s disease. You cannot bring them back to yours. If the person tells you he had breakfast with his mother that morning (and you know his mother had been dead for many years), ask him what they had to eat or what they talked about. If the person tells you someone stole her wallet, offer to help her look for it and redirect her to something else in the looking process — old pictures, a television program, or a familiar object. Constantly correcting the person leads to low self-esteem and depression, very common side effects of Alzheimer’s. Think of it from their point of view, if you were constantly corrected and told you were wrong, how would you feel? Alzheimer’s may keep the person from remembering exactly what you said, but the feeling of being constantly in the wrong will persist.
Music is one of the best ways to connect with a person who has Alzheimer’s disease, regardless of their stage in the disease process. What was your loved one’s favorite music in his teens and twenties? If you bring out those songs, even dance to them if possible, you will be surprised at the results. Is your loved one religious or was she religious in her youth? If so, bring out the religious songs she would have sung as a youngster. Until the day he died in late stage Alzheimer’s disease, my father-in-law could sing the hymns of his childhood, even though he would never sing with the congregation in church. At the time of his death, he had not spoken in 4 – 6 months, but he could still sing. We discovered this when he was in an inpatient hospice facility in the last 4 days of his life. A great example of a musical connection is the video of Naomi Feil (the author of the “validation therapy” concept) and Gladys Wilson. The church songs of Gladys Wilson’s youth “awakened” her to a connection with Naomi Feil, even when to all appearances, Mrs. Wilson had lost the ability to interact with anyone.
Music uses more parts of the brain than any other activity, so it can often bypass damaged areas. Religious music in particular (if the person is or was religious in youth) is valuable, because there is safety and emotion tied to it, thus involving even more parts of the brain. Also, other than smiles and affection, music is often the only way to connect with a person is the late stages of the disease.
Familiar objects and family photos can be a wonderful way to connect. Because Alzheimer’s steals the brain’s ability to lay down new memories, it would be expected that a woman would remember details of her wedding from 50 years earlier, but not what she had for breakfast. In the “Art to Life” class sponsored by the University of Alabama Honors College and Cognitive Dynamics Foundation, the students connected with a participant in mid-stage Alzheimer’s disease by bringing out her wedding dress. The woman, who had become withdrawn and depressed prior to this conversation, discussed her wedding preparations and wedding day with great enthusiasm — fittings for the dress, family drama, her excitement at marrying the man she loved, etc. Pictures can bring forth the same enthusiastic responses. Bring out family photos from the person’s childhood or early adulthood. You will be surprised what happens.
All the new research points to the fact that the person with Alzheimer’s is “still here.” It is our job as caregivers to find ways to reach our loved ones.

212,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/conversations-we-wish-wed-had/,"Molly Rowe owns FirstLight Home Care of Salem, MA with her husband, Steve, and lives in Swampscott with their two sons.
About a year ago last summer, my husband, his siblings, and I sat around our kitchen table having the conversation we’d long avoided—how to care for Dad. Like most people who end up sitting at this table, we had a lot of questions and not a lot of answers. We Googled things like home care and visiting nurses, debated how to take his driver’s license away, and fretted about how we’d bring it up to him. Little did we know, our conversation that night was futile, because Dad had already passed away—alone in his home, as we feared he might.
Dad (or Dad-in-law to me) lived alone in Florida, not far from his daughter. As anyone who’s watched a parent age knows, “not far” becomes “too far” when the wheels start coming off. The ambulance had visited his house one too many times, we had a feeling his diet consisted mostly of frozen meatballs and grocery store pastries, and we were uneasy about the plethora of medications we saw floating around his bedroom.
When you’re the adult child of an aging parent, it’s very easy to rationalize the situation and make it better: He still sent Christmas and birthday cards. He paid all his bills on time. His house was organized. In so many ways, Dad was the same person he’d always been, so we avoided having those tough conversations—and ultimately, we’ll always regret that.
A big part of the problem was that, even though he was in Florida—the senior capital of the world—we didn’t know where to start. There were almost too many resources to choose from. Home care providers, independent senior communities, assisted living, visiting nurses, Meals on Wheels, adult daycare … We didn’t know what to choose or why.
Now that we’ve started a business hoping to make better the very issue we faced two years ago, we’ve learned so much more about what’s out there. And we’ve learned the importance of conversations.
If we had it to do over, we would talk with everyone—physicians, nurses, elder care lawyers, senior resource centers, home care providers. A conversation doesn’t mean commitment, and asking for advice doesn’t mean you have to take it, but if you don’t ask questions, you’ll never get the answers you need.
We are lucky to live in an area with a wealth of resources—once you start asking, you’ll be amazed what’s available. If you’re the primary caregiver for your parent, there are people—great people—who can help care for your dad just to give you a break once in a while. There are people who will take him to Red Sox games or get your mom to church on Sunday. There are people who will pop in and help your mom get ready in the morning, feed her breakfast, then come back at night to tuck her in. There are rides and meals and caregivers … All you have to do is ask.
The biggest conversation we wish we’d had would have been with our dad. Like most of us would, he clung fiercely to his independence. But now we know that if we’d had that conversation—convinced him to take advantage of the many resources available to him—he would have lived a happier end of life with services that ultimately helped him preserve his independence by keeping him home and healthy.

213,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/coping-strategies-for-dementia-caregivers/,"This week, we have a guest post from one of our readers, Annabelle Short. Anna is a caregiver to her mom who is living with dementia and she has some valuable advice on coping strategies for dementia caregivers.
Sometimes, the decision of becoming a caregiver is not entirely up to you. Unexpected life events might lead you to start taking care of a loved one, and suddenly you realize you have a new career commitment: to care for someone else. This was precisely what happened to me when I had to start taking care of my mom.
My mom suffers from dementia, which is a ruthless disease; it changes completely the people you love, leaving them in a state almost impossible to recognize. My mom has always been an independent woman. She took care of my father until he passed away and she kept active for as long as she could; but there came a time when she was the one who needed care and supervision. Honestly, I was not prepared for it. We struggled a lot in the beginning, but I believe we have found the right pace now, and I would like to share a few coping strategies I have learned.
Tip 1: Keep a Routine
I have tried to keep her routine as best as possible. Everything she used to do in past years, such as drinking her morning coffee, taking a short walk and shower time. We might change the schedule a little bit when visiting doctors or preparing for health exams. Routine is reassuring for most people who require special assistance; it keeps them calm and self-confident by knowing how their day will be.
I also encourage my mom to do the most she can by herself. It is frustrating for someone who has been used to do everything by themselves to suddenly depend on someone else, even if that someone loves them very much. So, even when I notice she is struggling with a simple task, I fight hard the urge of stepping in and doing it for her.
Tip 2: Protect the house
It is usual for seniors to lose some motor skills and balance, especially those with cognitive impairment. It is crucial to prevent injuries and accidents that can happen within the house. We have installed some grab bars in critical zones, such as the shower. I got rid of all her slippery rugs (which she still mad at me for) and fixed some loose stones and tiles on the patio. Even though I do all the cooking at home, and we have an electric kettle for the tea, my mom likes to turn on the stove for some reason. So, I have installed a device that turns off the oven or stove automatically.
My mom also has several bookshelves, so I have asked a friend to help me secure them to the walls for safety reasons. I try to keep everything within her reach to avoid her trying to climb, but sometimes it is difficult. I am still considering removing them and finding a new place for her books and other things.
Tip 3: Learn how to interpret behavior
My mom is usually calm; on rare occasions does she exhibit undesirable behavior. But as we have been together for some time now, I already know what triggers her bad mood. Most of the time it is because she doesn’t want to go to the doctor; or I have changed something around the house she didn’t like (like removing her rugs). Sometimes it’s because she is bored, or she has some pain. In the beginning, when she was still trying some new prescription medications, she also had some drastic mood swings. I communicated to her doctor about it, and luckily, he was able to change it.
My suggestion is to understand the root of any unusual behavior. Sometimes the person you take care of can’t express what they are feeling with words, so it is up to you to decipher. Try checking to see if the person might be hungry, tired, in pain, frustrated, or so on. Unfortunately, dementia is a degenerative disease, and chances are the person will be less and less capable of communicating properly over time.
Tip 4: Enjoy your time together
Through ups and downs, you can try to make the best of your time together. My mom is still lucid most of the time, and it is a blessing for now. We enjoy our teatime, watching some TV together, and listening to her favorite songs. It is not always easy to listen to her tell over and over the same past stories, but I try to encourage her to remember everything she can. Some days she spends hours going through our photo albums, simply remembering when she was young, when she met my father and so on. She still remembers most of our family, so it is another weekly thing we practice.
Tip 5: Technology could help you care for your loved one
My mom can still be left for a few hours by herself, but I used to be terrified if something happened and I wouldn’t know in time. That’s why I decided to invest in an alert system at home. This system allows her to request help with just the press of a button. The package I chose includes a 24/7 monitoring center that will respond to her call. In case your loved one is unable to speak, the responder will call home first, and then the contacts listed on the profile.
There are several different packages available which might bring some extra peace of mind, some include GPS and fall detection. You can just choose according to your needs and budget available.
Aside from medical alert system, I have also invested in medication reminders and smart home system. With the advent of recent technologies has come some relief from much of the difficulty that comes with at-home caregiving.
Final Thoughts
Taking care of someone with dementia can be overwhelming and exhaustive. No one is “born ready” for the job, and unless you have studied to be a professional caregiver, chances are you will learn as you go. So, read about the disease as much as you can, and seek support and knowledge through local communities related to dementia. Also, take advantage of what technology can bring, and invest in equipment that could offer a better life quality for yourself and loved one.

214,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/coping-with-the-death/,"By Cindy Smith, Adult Daughter
My Mother was 82-years-old and had been given Last Rites three times. She had been sick for 10 years, and her death had not been unexpected. But when the finality comes, it leaves a gaping abyss that is difficult to fill. It is true that death is harder on those left behind.
I was a long distance caregiver for eight years and we used to talk on the phone for an hour every day (thank goodness they don’t charge by the minute for long distance calls anymore). She would give me advice on my kids, my husband and my job. Granted, some of it was unsolicited, but she was my best friend, my confidante and I looked forward to talking to her every day. It was our routine, a great jumpstart to the day. You know mothers and daughters … they NEVER run out of things to say!
(As an aside, there’s a genetic reason for that. Research has shown that women say 13,0000 more words/day than men because of the Fox2protein known as the “language protein” in our brains). My Dad could have told them that!
So now I wake up in the morning and I’m not sure what to do with that hour. Sure I could fill it, but there’s a void. A hole that not even Matt Lauer can fill.
When she first passed away, people tried to console me by saying: “her spirit will live on in you and your kids forever.” Really? What kind of psychobabble is that? Or “remember the good times you had together.” Seriously? I want her here NOW – I don’t want to have to conjure up some distant memory! I miss her. I love her. Like a petulant child, I want her back!
Coping Mechanisms
So let me share a few little tips I learned to help me deal with the loneliness. First, I recorded a few of our conversations before she passed away. It brightens my day to hear her voice first thing in the morning! Because one of the first things you will miss is hearing from your Mom. It helps me to remember her laugh, and the way we used to tease her when she would call my brother and I each other’s names.
My Mom was crazy about sports cars and had the speeding tickets to prove it! In fact, the reason she lost her license was not because of forgetfulness or loss of agility … the insurance company refused to insure her!

215,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/coping-with-the-loss-of-a-parent/,"Losing a parent is a traumatic experience and hiding under your blankets may sound like the best idea for you…or simply wish that it all went away. However, we all know that
this may work short-term, but it is important to have long-term plans on how to cope with the loss of a parent. The most important thing to remember is that everyone grieves differently. You can find a million and one ways to cope and grieve but it is important to find coping skills that work for you. Also, be aware that your coping skills may be different than other loved ones coping skills and make sure to respect that during this difficult time. There is nothing better than the support of family and the feeling of teamwork when coping with a loss.
The first and most important process is to honor your parent’s wishes. Give them the proper burial and plan their celebration of life as they see fit for their death. Local funeral homes, wills, other family members, and memories of their life will help you through this process. The financial obligation can be stressful, but there are beautiful ways to honor wishes and provide a wonderful service without it getting too pricey. Many times, parents will have money set aside, but in cases where they don’t, do what you know you can handle, as I am sure that is how your parent would want it.
During the coping process it is easy to shut people out and want to spend time alone. Alone time is extremely important during the coping/grieving process, but having a support system around you also helps heal the way.
It is wise to find a good balance when alone time is right and when it is time to add support to the process. Remember, many around you are also grieving and having you there for support will benefit all as well as ease some pain.
A unique way to cope the loss of a parent is to play out something your parent always wanted to do. We all know that there may be a “bucket list” item that may not have been crossed off. Take the time to experience that opportunity and live out something your parent always wanted to do. This will help you feel close to your parent and give you a feeling of joy that their wishes live on.
With that said, it is most important to keep your parent’s memories alive. Keepsakes, valuables, pictures, and stories are all good ways to do just that. Telling stories of your parents to your children will continue their life and add value to their life even after death. Don’t ever be afraid that you are telling too much. It is helpful during the grieving process to talk of your parent and to find joy in a time of sorrow. Remember, your parent will want you to move on and continue with your life, and in doing so, keep their love close to your heart at all times."
216,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/cost-of-caregiving/,"Many of us are caregivers – for our parents, brothers or sisters, or other relatives – and don’t even think about the financial demands it places on us. Maybe you are a caregiver who provides “hands on” care right now, but may be called upon to provide financial assistance for your care recipient in the future. In addition to the emotional demands placed on caregivers, it’s important to consider the financial consequences.
If it’s possible to plan ahead, this helps to avoid some costly mistakes so you don’t get yourself in a financial bind. If you’re taking care of a parent, for instance, what is their
income and assets? Can you spread any financial expenses around to other family
members? Is there any aid they can take advantage of such as the Aid and Assistance Allowance from the Veteran’s Administration?
Here’s some caregiving expenses you need to think about:
- Travel expenses.
- Food and meals.
- Transportation or gas in driving to medical appointments & errands.
- Time away from work or eventually having to quit
your job or change your status to part-time to take care of someone full-time.
- Medical expenses above what health insurance, Medicaid or supplemental health insurance will pay including prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, incontinence supplies, etc.
- Housecleaning services.
- Personal care or respite care.
- Medical assistance devices such as MedAlert, wheelchairs, walkers, mobility aids, etc.
- Home modifications such as ramps and handlebars or handicap accommodations.
According to the Family Caregiver Alliance, long term caregiving has significant financial
consequences for caregivers: informal caregivers personally lose about $659,139 over a lifetime: $25,494 in Social Security benefits; $67,202 in pension benefits; and $566,443 in forgone wages.
To pay for the added expense of caring for another person, families often cut back on their own vacation or leisure time activities, take on additional jobs or a loan, reduce annual contributions to savings plans or IRAs and delay their home improvement projects.
Wouldn’t it be great if more financial help was available to family caregivers? Although there have been recent attempts by Congress to pass tax legislation giving caregivers some relief from long-term care expenses, it’s never been a high priority. Yet is should be. A federal investment in family caregiver support is needed now more than ever.
Wouldn’t you agree?"
217,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/couple-infuses-business-with-passion/,"Growing up in the suburbs of Atlanta, John Tolbert spent a great deal of time with his grandmother when his parents were at work. While she helped raise him for many years, she unfortunately fell sick when John was a teenager. That’s when the family enlisted the help of a caregiver. Unlike a nursing home, they felt as though an in-home caregiver would give her the personal attention she required. And they were right. The experience had such a great impact on John that he and his wife, Shea, opened FirstLight Home Care this September. As the first FirstLight franchise in the Atlanta market, the Tolberts’ business will service Alpharetta, Roswell, Sandy Spring, Buckhead, Dunwoody, Smyrna and Vinings.
This week, John was featured on Atlanta Business Radio. He discussed his career transition into the rapidly growing home care industry, the reasons for its growth and why consumers are continuing to choose in-home care.
As a former medical assistant, Shea is excited to get back to her roots after staying at home to raise her children for the past seven years. John, on the other hand, previously served as a multi-unit franchisee for WorldWide Express. In 2004, however, he decided to sell his franchises along the East Coast and move back to Alpharetta to care for his aging parents. He will continue to act as a caregiver towards his parents as he grows his FirstLight business."
218,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/creating-a-plan-for-the-future/,"I am often struck by the difficulty people have when it comes to discussing financial planning issues with family members. But looking ahead to how you can ensure the best possible care for someone who is no longer able to live on their own will be one of the smartest decisions you make. Often times it’s a fall, accident or diagnosis that may trigger the discussion—which may prove to be too little too late. Consider these suggestions when looking ahead to future care.
• Consider the needs of a loved one: How does the senior in your life want to spend their later years? In-home care, like the services provided by FirstLight Home Care, are a viable option for those looking to age in their homes. Other options, such as assisted living facilities or retirement communities, can skew much higher in cost—something family members will have to consider as a loved one ages.
• Invest in long-term care insurance: Start early. Coverage for a healthy 50-year-old can cost just over $1,300 a year while someone in his or her 70s can pay nearly $6,500 per year. Planning ahead saves everyone money in the long run.
• Options for creating a will: Having a will is a basic start, but a living trust has also become an increasingly popular option because it gives a person more control over the managing of assets. These documents can all be passed along to a spouse, children or other heirs to avoid attorney fees.
• Reverse the mortgage: Instead of making payments to a lender, let the lender make direct payments to the person or family responsible for care through a reverse mortgage. The practice is increasingly popular, especially for those requiring home care.
While starting the conversation may not be easy, planning can be—with enough foresight. In the meantime, I hope everyone has a safe and happy Labor Day weekend!"
219,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/creating-a-safe-space-for-adults-living-with-dementia/,"If your aging senior is living with dementia, Alzheimer’s or other cognitive disorder, you know what a challenge it can be to make them feel safe and comfortable as these conditions can make understanding the world around them a difficult and confusing experience.
In fact, your loved one may see the place they call home in a completely different way than you do. Fortunately, researchers have dug deep into what makes homes safe and more livable for those living with dementia.
How do People with Dementia See the World?
For people living with dementia, visual stimuli aren’t received in the same way as they are in neurotypical brains. For instance, logic tells us that a mirror is just a reflective glass, and the reflection in the mirror is just a reflection of us. But dementia can scramble that logic, telling an aging adult with the disease that the person in the mirror is a stranger. This can be a stressful and scary experience.
Shadows and other dark surfaces on the floor can appear as holes. If you notice your loved one avoiding rugs or dark spots on the floor, this may be why. Crowded and cluttered spaces can be similarly disorienting, as these can contribute to the visual noise that makes a room difficult to understand.
Because memory works differently in adults living with dementia, changes in decor or misplaced furniture can make them feel like they’re somewhere else entirely. When creating spaces or adapting the home to help our loved one’s age in place, it’s important to base design decisions on how they see and experience the world.
Creating Comfortable Spaces for Adults with Dementia
When family caregivers begin creating spaces for their seniors to age in place, they should consider reducing clutter and removing confusing items. Furniture should be sparse and uncluttered too. Overall, these spaces should create a sense of calm and not provide excessive stimuli.
- Walls, floors, and décor items should be light, calming colors. This can help reduce shadows and dark spots.
- Avoid using loud, bright colors, busy patterns or lots of decoration.
- Spaces should be well-lit, and the lighting should be arranged to reduce dark areas. This helps to avoid trips and falls and minimize shadow hallucinations.
- Glass windows and staircases should be clearly marked to avoid injury.
Making Sure the Home is Safe
For adults with dementia, homes can be filled with dangerous things. Locks on bedrooms and bathrooms can be hazardous, faucets and tubs can cause scalds, and liquid on hard flooring can lead to broken bones and other serious injuries. To address these issues, install grab bars, large non-slip mats and temperature controls in the bathroom, and consider replacing doorknobs with non-locking ones so they can be opened in the event of a fall or other emergency.
Hazards can extend outside the home as well. Wet leaves, roots, branches and steppingstones can be dangerous and should be cleared or removed. It’s also a good idea to make sure the outside of the home is well-lit to avoid shadows and dark shapes at night.
Finally, consider adding web-connected door and window alarms, as well as cameras, around the home. Adults with dementia may attempt to find places from their past and can easily get lost once they leave their homes. These devices can alert you if they wander off.
Keeping Loved Ones Safe Requires Patience and Persistence
Helping those with dementia age in place requires ongoing care, frequent check-ins and a watchful eye, but it’s not impossible. In addition to making spaces safer and more comfortable for them, there are a few other things you can do to keep them from becoming ill or sustaining an injury.
- Check the pantry and fridge for expired or spoiled food
- Keep things like pet food and car keys out of sight
- Keep the home clean and clear of objects that may be disorienting
- Check faucets, electrical devices and cooking equipment to make sure they haven’t been left on.
If these tasks become too stressful, a professional home care service can provide extra support and peace of mind."
220,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/cruisin-in-the-fast-lane/,"A recent video news clip from Philadelphia’s NBC affiliate shows a 68-year old woman driving the wrong way down a major express way—putting her life as well as many others on the road at stake. Unfortunately, this scenario and other related accidents occur daily as many seniors encounter driving difficulties as they age. According to AAA, 86 percent of respondents to a recent survey said they were “concerned” about their elderly parent’s ability to drive.
Assessing an older adult’s driving skills and deciding whether or not to take the keys away is a very hard decision. There are many factors related to aging that affect a senior’s driving skills; vision, hearing, quick decision making, reaction time and medication all impact how well a senior can navigate on the road.
AAASeniors.com is an informative and resourceful site for people who are worried about their elderly driver. The site includes great tips on the following: early planning tips, communication advice for when to have the conversation about giving up the keys, how to assess a senior’s skills on the road, choosing the right vehicle for your elderly loved one and how to know when to take the keys away for good.
Remember, although it may be hard to take away your parent’s or elderly family members’ drivers license, it is much better than the alternative of having someone get hurt."
221,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/customers-come-first/,"Many of you may not know that much of FirstLight’s focus on client satisfaction comes from my son’s experience working at the Ritz Carlton in Atlanta.
Devin, 27, worked at the hotel for three years before coming on board at FirstLight. The training he received at the Ritz taught him that customers come first; a happy customer means a happy business owner. And that’s a philosophy that can be easily transferred to elderly care.
Our mission at FirstLight is helping seniors stay in the comfort and security of their own home. I’ve learned over the years—through various jobs and caring for my late mother-in-law—that the smallest gestures can make a world of difference. For instance, services like meal preparation, house cleaning and grocery shopping can help the loved one in your life more than you realize.
Last week, the Cincinnati Inquirer wrote a great piece on the company culture at FirstLight. I spoke with the reporter about the superior customer service my son learned at the Ritz. We also discussed how the franchise finds the best franchisees and trains them to hire the most capable and caring people—something we also implement at FirstLight. Our ideal franchisees are those that have a heart for serving others.
We can only hope that this dedication to customer service comes through in the local communities we serve. If you’d like to read the full article on what we look for in franchisees and how we help them succeed, please click HERE."
222,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/dealing-with-loneliness-in-the-elderly/,"Loneliness is something we can help elderly family and friends overcome. Depending upon when you spot loneliness behavior in your elderly parent will determine how they react to your attempt to bring them into a more activities. They may well be in a depressive state if they are isolated and one of the symptoms of this is a lack of desire to socialize. Consequently they may not be keen to make the effort, but you have to recognize the importance of breaking them out of this vicious circle. Here are some tips to help you and your elderly family members facing loneliness:
- Phone Calls. It sounds obvious, but in our own busy life it’s easy to neglect a very simple action. A daily phone call if you live far away from your parent can make the world of difference.
- Local Groups. There are groups in most communities which he or she could join. There might be day centers, lunch clubs, book groups, hobby clubs such as knitting or historical interest, or groups which provide outings for the elderly.
- Pets. If your parent is able to look after a pet this can provide a much-loved companion as well as a sense of responsibility which can help your parent feel more positive and in control.
- Get involved. Work with local senior care businesses to develop “check-in” or weekly events/activities that your aging parents to participate in.
- The Internet. Getting your parent online can be a great way of beating isolation as well as providing excellent mental stimulation. Find discussion boards relating to hobbies and passions and they’ll soon be interacting with other people who share their interests.
- Letter writing (yes, we said letter writing). Corresponding through a pen pal or in the name of worthy causes such as Amnesty International can break isolation and develop a sense of usefulness.
- Adult Education. You’re never too old to learn something new! Not only does adult education provide intellectual activity, it also offers a great opportunity for social interaction.
Loneliness is something our aging parents and elderly community members can overcome. We can help them by simply talking to them and determining the best type of social interaction that best fits their needs. And remember, loneliness is when you are unhappy to be alone. Solitude is when you are happy to be alone. There is nothing wrong with solitude, wanting to, or enjoying being alone. Alone time can be useful and enjoyable."
223,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/dealing-with-the-guilt-of-a-parent-living-far-away/,"Caring for loved ones from far away isn’t always an easy task. Many times, they need stay-at-home care that can’t be given from miles away. Sometimes you can feel helpless not being able to provide personal home care for those in your life who need it the most. Know that these feelings are valid, and you are not alone. In fact, there are about 7 million Americans providing long-distance home care to their loved ones. Like you, they are in charge of arranging doctor appointments, coordinating all the healthcare and insurance, working full time and taking care of their own families.
Although hiring a caregiver can help lighten the load and provide much-needed assistance at your loved one’s home, negative thoughts and feelings of guilt over not being there yourself can creep in from time to time. But remember – you are enough. Your sacrifices help make a positive impact on the lives of your loved ones.
Whenever you’re feeling doubt about the impact you’re making on your loved one’s home care, remember these tips to make the situation as a long-distance caregiver a little easier:
- Keep in daily contact. For the technologically savvy, there are multiple ways to be seen and heard (facetime, Zoom, etc). Be there as a sounding board, so your loved ones can talk about their feelings. You’ll feel more emotionally attached knowing what’s going on.
- Visit as often as you can. It may not be easy, but any chance you can find to visit will create better memories for everyone.
- Stay in touch with their physicians. If possible, find a physician or dentist who can come to them.
- Hire a caregiver to be your eyes and ears. Caregivers take care of all the important duties at home including cooking, cleaning, driving to appointments, etc. They can be a lifeline to your loved one when you need it the most. FirstLight at-home caregivers do more by building meaningful relationships.
- Establish an emergency system. Always have a suitcase packed and line of communication to those in contact with your loved one, including a physician or caregiver.
- Call in hospice. Hospice doesn’t mean it’s the end. Hospice caregivers provide additional home care for your loved one, including medications and providing support at a time when you need it most.
Although being a long-distance caregiver can be exhausting at times, you have a community of support with FirstLight that can help you realize what’s most important: you’re doing a great job. If you do find yourself overwhelmed or needing help, we’ll be there to take care of you and your loved one."
224,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/dear-mom/,"Mother’s Day is Sunday, May 10, 2015. To celebrate the day, FirstLight Home Care pulled together some wonderful ways to celebrate and honor your mom.
1. Write Her A Letter. Yes, we’re saying go “old school”. The art of letter writing is dying and we want to revive it. Find a great card, sit down and memorialize what you love about your mom. Mail it to her and it will be a surprise in her mailbox when it is delivered.
2. Take A Stroll. Spring has sprung and if you both can, take a stroll. Head out to a local park or garden and enjoy the outdoors. People watch, visit, or just spend a quiet moment together. Afterwards, grab a coffee or lunch.
3. Plant An Indoor Flower Arrangement. Pick up your mom’s favorite flowers, or herbs, potting soil, and two pots. We recommend two so that you both can have one and after the plants are potted you both can take one and have something wonderful to look at when you’re not together.
4. Cook Her Dinner – All Week. Pull your favorite recipes and make 4 or 5 meals to help her with lunch and dinners throughout the week. Check out our blog post on simple meal planning to get ideas and tips to simplify the meal time.
5. Get Creative. For the mom with a creative spirit, sign up both of you for a painting or art class. There are many fun organizations (like Canvas and Cocktails) that offer entertaining day and evening painting classes. Whether you are artistic or not, the helpful instructors and the positive painting environment make it a fun mom-date time.
From all of us at FirstLight Home Care, Happy Mother’s Day!"
225,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/defining-your-resources-in-a-crisis/,"Guest blogger Joni Aldrich addresses the importance of being able to ask for help when you need it. Here are her tips on how to ask for and accept help and on how to identify who is best for each situation.
As you go through any type of life crisis, you may need support from people who care. As you seek help, consider it a delegation process—not a burden.
Many of us are too proud to ask for help from others, even if we realize that people care and want to offer support. Get past that, and accept help with heartfelt gratitude. Sooner rather than later, make a “third cousin Dave twice removed on my mother’s side” list. These are people that you know who can help. With this list, you can start organizing and defining resources. Is Aunt Sally available to cook? Is Tom available to provide transportation to and from appointments? There may be many even more critical needs in the days and weeks ahead.
Try to include multiple people for each task on your “to do” list. You don’t want helping to become a long-term burden or depend on someone to the point that they burn out. Availability may be a concern. While people can’t take time away from work or school, they will usually be glad to help during their free time. Others may have health problems. Your life may be progressing differently, but the lives of others will be ongoing. You’ll have to work around these concerns.
On your list, make a column for strengths, constraints, and contact information. Start notifying key people. Explain what you’re going through, discuss the need that you feel they can help with, and then ask if you can count on their support. Make note of any concerns that come up in the conversation.
Your resource list should include but not be limited to the following categories:
Medical—These are people such as doctors (even if their field is podiatry), nurses, pharmacists, and therapists. If you have contacts in the medical field, they can help you to sort through your treatment information, offer advice on medical decisions, and explain the lingo. See if they can be available to go with you to your appointments during critical visits.
Family obligations—Include people who are available to help with elderly parents, children, or pets. This can be a sensitive area because you need complete confidence and trust in your resources to help in this area.
Personal—Many of my friends received calls late at night and listened patiently while I cried out my pain and fears. My friend Becky was there to help me when I received bad news about my husband’s cancer from the doctor while I was at work. True friends have a significant role when life’s dramas threaten to overwhelm you.
Technical—You may need help from people with computer savvy. If medical treatment requires that you must be away from home for long periods of time, you will need a computer, preferably a laptop. Convert to e-bills so that bills can be received through the Web no matter where you are. Also, e-mail is a great tool to update friends and family. Many treatment facilities have free wireless service.
Mental—These are resources such as social workers, counselors, and support groups. Your hospital or treatment center will have personnel available to help you through your mental exhaustion and the overwhelming stress involved in getting through any crisis.
Spiritual—Include on your list churches and other spiritual support groups. Faith and prayer are especially important to people going through traumatic life events. It can be soothing to the patient and caregiver to receive visits from ministers, rabbis or priests.
Organizations—Are you a veteran? The VFW (Veterans of Foreign Wars) is a potential resource. Are you a member of the Elks Club, Rotary Club, Shriner’s or Lions Club? Is there a local branch of any of these charitable organizations in your community? It doesn’t cost anything to ask for assistance.
General home front—These are the people who can help you with things such as watching your house, yard work, and collecting mail, if you have to be away from home for a long period of time.
Financial—Who can help you with bill payments, cutting expenses, and providing tax assistance? Seek helpers to work with you to streamline your bills. During tax season, I recommend a good tax accountant. This is one burden you definitely don’t need, especially when your head is full of more critical stuff. They can also help determine the proper filing of your medical expenses.
Information—If people aren’t supplied with an accurate update, the rumors can run rampant. You won’t, however, have time to call or write everyone. Set up an informed spokesperson for each of these groups: family, friends, work, church, neighbors and organizations. Provide each spokesperson with a list of people to notify by e-mail or phone as your situation changes.

226,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/dementia-and-money/,"Alzheimer’s is a debilitating illness that afflicts millions of Americans. As the population of seniors continues to grow, so too will the numbers of people with one of the seven types of dementia. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, an estimated 5.2 million American currently have the illness, which is 11% of people ages 65 and older. There is an additional 200,000 people who have younger-onset dementia.
The numbers get scarier as the age increases. One third of the population ages 85 and older have Alzheimer’s disease.
There are many facets of the illness families have to cope with, but here we are going to talk about one: financial. Not only do you have to worry about the cost of future care, but you need to recognize the signs early on that a person with dementia should no longer be in charge of the family’s finances.
How Finances Should Work
Ideally, both people in a relationship should be aware of all money matters and investments, regardless of dementia. This is just sound financial planning. Gone are the days when the husband was the breadwinner and was in charge of all financial decision. Here is the information every couple should know:
Financial
- Checking account and savings account numbers
- All investment information including stock or certificates
- Any 401K, IRAs or pensions
- When bills need to be paid
- Gathering tax information
- Insurance policies including health, car, life, homeowner’s, etc.
- Social Security information
Legal
- Location of all deeds, mortgages, car titles
- Wills & living wills
- Legal power of attorney
- Medical power of attorney
It is important that you get financial and care plans in place before the illness progresses. Depending on the size of your estate, you may want to get a financial planner or estate planner involved to protect your assets in the future and give you both a sense of security. Every state has different laws when it comes to financial and legal matters, so it is best to be informed about certain consequences. If you can’t afford an attorney, contact the Alzheimer’s Association for a list of pro bono attorneys in your area.
When Is Late Too Late?
An alarming study was conducted by economists Joanne W. Hsu of the Federal Reserve Board and Robert Willis of the University of Michigan. They studied Americans over 50 and their spouses between 1998 through 2008. What they found was that 80% of spouses who were already in the throes of dementia were still managing the family’s finances.
This could have life-altering consequences for some couples. The person with dementia could be making serious mistakes without even knowing it. And if you wait too long for the person with cognitive impairment to explain everything, he/she may lack the awareness to explain everything correctly.
Additionally, the study found that people with dementia could be more susceptible to fraud. Older victims of financial fraud already lose $2.9 billion annually, according to a 2011 MetLife study.
This could result in squandering money you don’t have and putting your financial future at risk.
Therefore to protect everyone from financial disaster, here are 5 suggestions by Forbes magazine:
- Both people in a relationship should know everything that needs to be known about finances.
- Each couple should have a financial power of attorney drawn up giving each other decision making power in the event of an unexpected injury or illness. At a minimum, name a proxy or a trusted adviser.
- If you notice your spouse starting to slip from dementia, assume responsibility for the finances. At first he/she may be opposed and hurt, but it’s important to secure your future.
- Develop a plan – emotionally, financially and physically so every one’s wishes are known.
If you need help with dementia care, FirstLight Home Care provides in-home dementia care to help sufferers and their family cope with the anxiety, depression, confusion and isolation the illness often brings."
227,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/dementia-care-important/,"According to the Alzheimer’s Association, more than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease, which is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States. 1 in 3 seniors dies with Alzheimer’s or another dementia disease and of the 5.4 million Americans with Alzheimer’s, an estimated 5.2 million of these are aged 65 and older.
At FirstLight Home Care, we have developed dementia care plans to help people who are suffering from dementia or Alzheimer’s cope with the anxiety, depression, confusion and isolation that is often associated with the disease. Our unique programs for dementia care services at home help not only the dementia sufferer, but the family as a whole.
To assist Alzheimer’s disease sufferers and their families, FirstLight Home Care has developed a unique Dementia Program to build dementia care services around the individual, not the disease. This process allows our caregivers to incorporate who the disease sufferers were, not who they are today. This unique personalized and engaging dementia home care approach has the goal of making sure that those who are affected by the disease live the rest of their lives with purpose.
Many people with dementia want care at home, to keep at least their surroundings familiar in a world suddenly filled with uncertainties. To assist with this, the caregivers and coordinators at FirstLight Home Care provide a “Who I Am” booklet that contains much more than a basic history. We want to understand the intangible things that make your mom or dad who they are. We ask questions like:
- What makes you happy?
- What makes you laugh?
- What makes you feel accomplished?
- What distresses or frustrates you?
Our long-term dementia caregivers and coordinators use this information to build specific and individualized dementia care plans for daily care. To help you throughout the process, we make you a part of our rigorous caregiver selection process and one-on-one consultations. In addition, to ensure that our dementia care services are always evolving to provide the best possible family experiences, we continually evaluate its effectiveness with client satisfaction surveys, client and caregiver focus groups, and advisory councils.
As caregivers, we understand the difficulties that present themselves for not only those who are suffering from Alzheimer’s or dementia, but for family members who are dealing with the repercussions of this terrible disease. If you have a family member that is dealing with Alzheimer’s or dementia, the caregivers and coordinators at FirstLight Home Care will work with your family and loved ones to create personalized care that can offer peace of mind and comfort for everyone."
228,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/dental-care-tips-for-older-adults/,"As you get older, new oral challenges can impact the health of your teeth and gums.
Aging presents new oral challenges, therefore maintaining good oral hygiene is critically important as we age. When problems occur in the mouth, they can cause difficulty chewing, swallowing, speaking and smiling — basic functions which can affect both physical and social well-being.
There are several dental conditions associated with aging, including:
Dry mouth: Dry mouth can result from physical changes within the body as it ages but can also be caused by medications. According to the American Dental Association, more than 400 commonly used medications can contribute to dry mouth, and dry mouth can increase the risk for oral disease. In fact, 30 percent of all tooth decay in older adults is caused by dry mouth, according to the Oral Cancer Foundation.
Attrition: Otherwise known as simple wear and tear. Many years of chewing and grinding can take a toll on an aging set of teeth, and as enamel wears down, the risk for cavities increases.
Gum disease: Gum disease is another major oral health issue faced by older people — and it’s presently the leading cause of tooth loss in adults. The disease is caused by plaque bacteria, which thrive in the sticky biofilm that clings to the surface of teeth when they aren’t properly cleaned. Poor-fitting dentures can make the problem worse, as can the presence of certain diseases, such as diabetes or cancer.
Mouth cancer: Oral cancer is a concern at any age, but it’s seven times more likely to show up in a person over the age of 65 — and it causes more deaths in older Americans than skin cancer.
Root decay: Often accompanied by gum disease, the roots of your teeth may become exposed as your gums recede, leading to an increased rate of decay as you age.
Maintaining a Healthy Mouth as You Age
As you age, it becomes even more important to take care of your teeth and practice good dental hygiene. One common misconception is that losing your teeth is inevitable. This is not true. If cared for properly, your teeth can last a lifetime. The American Dental Association recommends the following:
- Add fluoride: Switch to a fluoride toothpaste or incorporate a fluoride rinse into your daily routine.
- Avoid tobacco: Tobacco in any form has been linked to an increased risk of mouth and throat cancer, not to mention heart disease and other serious conditions. Chewing tobacco can even lead to more decay, as many tobacco formulations contain sugar.
- Drink more water: To decrease dry mouth, ask your doctor if you can substitute your medication for one that doesn’t produce dry mouth. If this is not a possible solution, then drink plenty of water, chew a sugar-free gum and avoid alcohol, which tends to dehydrate your body.
- Use mouthwash: When used with brushing and flossing, an antibacterial mouthwash can reduce the buildup of plaque.
FirstLight can support seniors during Dental Hygiene Month by providing caregivers to help with things such as:
- Keeping clients and families updated on regular dental check-ups, cleanings and oral exams

229,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/depression-and-aging/,"Depression is not a normal part of aging. However, older adults are at an increased risk for depression. Research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention note that 80% of older adults have a least one chronic health condition, and 50% have two or more. Depression is more common in people who have other illnesses or whose function becomes limited. It also increases in those who require home healthcare and older hospital patients.
Unsure if a family member is suffering from depression? Here are some signs from CDC that might help you confirm your concerns:
Signs of Depression
- Feelings of hopelessness
- Feelings of guilt, worthlessness and/or helplessness
- Irritability, restlessness
- Loss of interest in activities or hobbies once pleasurable
- Fatigue and decreased energy
- Difficulty concentrating, remembering details and making decisions
- Insomnia, early-morning wakefulness, or excessive sleeping
- Overeating or appetite loss
- Thoughts of suicide, suicide attempts
- Persistent aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems that do not get better, even with treatment
Depression is a true and treatable medical condition, but for some older adults this can be misdiagnosed and/or go under treated. If you are concerned that a family member is suffering with depression offer to go with them to a health provider to seek care. To learn more about depression visit WebMd."
230,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/depression-in-seniors/,"Depression is common amongst aging parents. As parents begin to age, they also begin to recognize the realities of their mortality through physical and mental limitations. Signs of depression should never be taken lightly-there are a number of important issues in regards to depression amongst the elderly. Please make sure to address these issues with those around you, all care takers, and your parents. Depression is not something that is easily spoken of but imperative that it be for the health and safety of your parents.
- Know the warning signs of depression. Take the time to be aware of the warning
signs of depression. Everyone goes through a feeling of “down in the dumps” as they age. However, if this is temporary, you should be able to regain some emotional balance. Those with clinical depression will not be able to bounce back. Knowing when depression has become this grave of an issue is difficult in the aging since the variables are more widespread. However, the warning signs are all the same, and become more worrisome the longer they stay. Some signs include, lack of sleep, crying, not eating, being irritable, no desire to involve themselves in daily activities, and discussion or attempt of suicide.
- Be aware of violence. Depression in aging can cause your parents to lash out, and if dementia has set in, them being upset may turn into violence. Learn supportive ways to work with your parents if this becomes a problem. Do not fight back, yet learn to manage such situations with relative calmness and understanding of their situation.
- Medicine is a beneficial treatment. Those aging with depression seem to respond
well to depression medicines. There are many excellent medications that can help with mood and daily activities. Most doctors will start with the most conservative dose of antidepressants and go from there in coordination with your parents’ needs. It is wise to have them involved in therapy alongside their medication, so they have someone to talk to.
- Research Respite Care in your area. Respite Care consists of adult services that
gives you, the caretaker, some time away, but also enables your parents to have
time to work on themselves and to better their health as they age. There are many respite care services that focus on depression issues and work with the aging on this matter.
Remember, depression as your parents age can become more prevalent, and prevalent is the key word. Aging isn’t always fun, and many feel down when they begin to be limited
in their daily physical and mental activities. However, this doesn’t always mean clinical depression. Either way, it is important that your parents receive the care they need either temporarily while they are having sad thoughts or long term if the issue of depression seems more permanent."
231,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/diabetes-alert-day-coming-risk/,"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 29 million Americans have diabetes, and one in four of them doesn’t even know it. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the disease and can be managed through diet, physical activity and appropriate use of insulin and oral medications to lower blood sugar levels. American Diabetes Association Alert Day® is next Tuesday, March 28. It’s observed to help sound the alarm about the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in American adults by asking people to take the “Type 2 Diabetes Risk Test.”
The Importance of Detection
Diabetes is a problem with your body that causes blood glucose (sugar) to rise to higher-than-normal levels – also called hyperglycemia. Normally, your pancreas releases insulin to help your body store and use the sugar and fat from the food you eat. Diabetes occurs when the pancreas produces little or no insulin, or the body doesn’t respond appropriately to the insulin (a condition called “insulin resistance”).
When glucose builds up in the blood instead of going into cells, it can cause two problems:
- In the short term, your cells may be starved for energy.
- Over time, high blood glucose levels may hurt your eyes, kidneys, nerves or heart.
Type 2 diabetes usually gets worse over time – even if you don’t need medications at first, you may need them as the disease progresses. There is no cure for diabetes, but it can be managed. And many people with the disease live long and healthful lives.
Take the Test
The warning signs of diabetes can be so mild that you don’t even notice them, or the symptoms may develop very gradually over time. They include:
- Increased thirst
- Increased hunger (especially after eating)
- Dry mouth
- Frequent urination
- Unexplained weight loss (even if you’re eating and feeling hungry)
- Fatigue (weak, tired feeling)
- Blurred vision
- Slow-healing sores
If left undiagnosed or untreated, diabetes can cause significant health problems. See your doctor if you experience any combination of these symptoms.
The American Diabetes Association offers a free, anonymous risk test that can help you learn, in just 60 seconds, if you’re at risk for type 2 diabetes. Knowing your risk is the first step toward a healthier life. Take the test today.
Lower Your Risk
There are some things that affect your risk for diabetes that you can’t change, such as age, race, gender and family history. Diabetes occurs more often in Hispanic/Latino Americans, African-Americans, Native Americans, Asian-Americans, Pacific Islanders and Alaska natives. Men are also more likely to be at risk than women, and your risk increases if you have a parent or sibling with the disease.
Those factors aside, the keys to preventing or delaying type 2 diabetes are in your control: Stay at a healthy weight, eat well and be active. Research shows that you can lower your risk for type 2 diabetes by 58 percent by:
- Losing 7 percent of your body weight (or 14 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds)
- Exercising moderately (such as brisk walking) 30 minutes a day, five days a week
The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases offers a game plan for reducing your chances of developing type 2 diabetes, including a list of 50 tips you can try today.
Living with Diabetes
If you’re diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, it’s important to take the disease very seriously. But it’s also important to know that you can live a healthful life if you take steps to proactively manage the disease. You’ll likely need to change some things about your daily routine, such as:
- Planning what you eat and following a balanced meal plan
- Exercising regularly
- Taking medicine, if prescribed, and closely following the guidelines for how and when to take it
- Monitoring your blood sugar and blood pressure levels at home
- Keeping your appointments with your healthcare providers and completing laboratory tests, as ordered by your doctor
The American Diabetes Association offers a healthy living guide that can help you manage your condition and avoid or delay complications. You can download the guide or even request that a copy be mailed to your home.

232,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/diabetes-awareness-month/,"November is Diabetes Awareness Month. Diabetes is one of the leading causes of disability and death in the United States. Nearly 30 million children and adults in the United States have diabetes. Another 86 million Americans have prediabetes and are at risk for developing type 2 diabetes. The American Diabetes Association estimates that the total national cost of diagnosed diabetes in the United States is $245 billion. Staggering!
If you are overweight, have high blood pressure, or are age 45 or older, you are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The good news is that making healthy changes can greatly lower your risk. To help prevent type 2 diabetes:
- Watch your weight
- Eat healthy
- Get more physical activity

233,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/diabetic-care-five-ways-to-avoid-complications-2/,"Diabetics and those caring for diabetics know and understand the severity of this disease. When living with diabetes it is important to also understand the care needed to prevent any complications. Diabetes has the ability to wear down our bodies over time; this chronic illness requires constant awareness. Here are five ways to avoid complications with diabetes:
- Stay up to date with diabetes information. Become an expert of the topic, medications, interventions, symptoms, complications, and new research and treatment.
- Maintain blood pressure and cholesterol levels since both can aid in blood vessel deterioration. A healthy diet and exercise can help.
- Continue yearly physicals and eye exams. Your doctors will look for signs of diabetic complications such as kidney disease, nerve damage, retinal damage, and other problems to the eye and body caused by diabetes.
- Take care of your teeth and watch your feet. Diabetes can cause gum infections as well as infections to the feet. High blood sugar can damage nerves in the feet as well as reduce blood flow.
- Say no to smoking and stress. Both much easier said than done. Make sure your support group is on board. Your doctors should be able to advise you on ways to quit smoking. Try to involve yourself in a hobby or exercise that can relieve stress from your day to day life.
According to the American Diabetes Association, 25.8 million children and adults are diabetic. Diabetes can cause a number of complications including heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, blindness, nerve damage, and amputations. There is no reason to feel as if you suffer from diabetes when the chance to live with diabetes is possible. Keeping yourself up to date and having a constant awareness of this chronic illness is imperative."
234,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/difficult-discussions-aging-parent/,"Have you noticed lately that your aging parent may need more help?
Perhaps you’ve seen expired food in their refrigerator? Or a mysterious new dent in the front of their car? Or perhaps they’ve started missing doses of their medication.
Having difficult discussions with your aging parent can be tough, especially if your parent is having trouble accepting the fact that they may need assistance. Your goal is to make sure they stay safe and healthy, but they may not see it that way. Having difficult discussions with your aging parent can be easier if you know how to approach the topic.
Some of these hard, but necessary, conversations include:
- Their finances
- Giving up the car keys
- Keeping the house clean and uncluttered
- Keeping fresh, nutritious food in the house
- Taking their medications properly
- Moving to a care facility
- Making advance health care plans
- End of life matters
So, how do you have these tough, sometimes uncomfortable conversations?
The best time to start “the talk” is before the first sign of a problem. It’s best if your parent is still in good health, independent and active. If problems have already begun, it could lead to certain health issues, which may require an immediate change in their lifestyle. So, it’s best to step in as early as possible. Make sure your parent understands you are taking the initiative so that they can maintain the best quality of life possible.
Do your homework
Formulate your thoughts in advance and have a basic idea of what you are going to say. Prepare some notes so that you won’t forget the important points you want to make. Remember, offering multiple solutions will give your loved one peace of mind and allow them to feel like they have a say in what’s best for them. Also, know what potential resources exist in your community so that you can provide the best options.
Decide who will be involved
If you have siblings or other family members who need to be part of the conversation, include everyone in the family who should be there. Set aside plenty of time, and make sure all family members can be present to focus on the conversation at hand.
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Put yourself in your parent’s shoes. Listen to them. Speak to them with respect and dignity, and treat them like adults. Give your parents some control, offer as many options as possible and explain the benefits of assistance. You are doing this because you care!
Show concern and sympathy
It’s not easy to talk to your parents about what you think is best for them. It can be hard to suddenly be in the dual roles of both child and caregiver. Focus the conversation around the most important concerns you have: health, safety, freedom, peace of mind. Discuss what you’ve observed and be honest about your worries.
When someone you love can’t take care of themselves like they used to, you worry about their health and safety and their quality of life. And you wonder about how they will feel when you bring up these concerns. But having these important conversations early and often may reduce anxiety and prevent a crisis down the road.
Additional resources
If you are worried about a parent’s driving, consider driving safety classes for older adults. AAA offers driver improvement courses to help senior drivers improve their skills and stay safe behind the wheel.
If you need to have difficult discussions with your aging parent about long-term care, this guide for families provides numerous tips on how to make this sometimes challenging conversation – and decision – easier.

235,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/disaster-preparedness-for-older-adults/,"As nature is hitting us with all forces across the nation; hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, and floods, a key resource for eldercare is an emergency supply kit.
Each older adult’s needs and abilities are unique, but every older adult can take important steps to prepare for all kinds of emergencies and put plans in place, even when residing in retirement community. Start by evaluating personal needs when making an emergency plan. A commitment to planning today will help prepare the older adult for any emergency situation. Consider how a disaster might affect your individual needs.
• Plan to make it on your own, at least for a period of time. It’s possible that you will not have access to a medical facility or even a drugstore.
• Identify what kind of resources you use on a daily basis and what you might do if they are limited or not available
• Get an emergency supply kit
• If you must evacuate and you have pets, take your pets with you. However, if you are going to a public shelter, it is important to understand that animals may not be allowed inside.
• Plan in advance for shelter alternatives that will work for both you and your pets; consider loved ones or friends outside of your immediate area who would be willing to host you and your pets in an emergency.
When preparing for a possible emergency situation, it’s best to think first about the basics of survival: fresh water, food, clean air, and warmth.
Recommended Items to Include in a Basic Emergency Supply Kit:
• Water, one gallon of water per person per day for at least three days, for drinking and sanitation
• Food, at least a three-day supply of non-perishable food
• Battery-powered or hand crank radio and a NOAA Weather Radio with tone alert and extra batteries for both
• Flashlight and extra batteries
• First aid kit
• Whistle to signal for help
• Dust mask, to help filter contaminated air and plastic sheeting and duct tape to shelter-in-place
• Moist towelettes, garbage bags, and plastic ties for personal sanitation
• Wrench or pliers to turn off utilities
• Can opener for food (if kit contains canned food)
• Local maps more information
Medications and Medical Supplies
If you take medicine or use a medical treatment on a daily basis, be sure you have what you need to make it on your own for at least a week, maybe longer.
• Make a list of prescription medicines including dosage, treatment, and allergy information.
• Talk to your pharmacist or doctor about what else you need to prepare.
• If you undergo routine treatments administered by a clinic or hospital or if you receive regular services such as home health care, treatment, or transportation, talk to your service provider about their emergency plans. Work with them to identify back-up service providers and incorporate them into your personal support network.
• Consider other personal needs such as eyeglasses, hearing aids and hearing aid batteries, wheelchair batteries, and oxygen.
• Include copies of important documents in your emergency supply kits such as family records, medical records, wills, deeds, social security number, charge and bank accounts information, and tax records.

236,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/do-caregivers-deserve-overtime-we-think-so/,"Many people, including the elderly, caregivers and home care agencies, are wondering how the Dept. of Labor’s proposed changes to the companionship and live-in worker regulations will affect the in-home care industry.
In 1974, these regulations originally created a limited exemption from both minimum wage and overtime pay requirements to domestic service workers (i.e. casual babysitters, home companions, maids/home help). Although the regulations have gone unchanged, the in-home care industry has changed dramatically and grown substantially. Yet, the earnings of in-home care employees remain among the lowest in the service industry—the caregivers that are now employed by in-home care agencies are not the same as what Congress envisioned when it enacted the exemption but nevertheless, agencies continue to take advantage of these exemptions. Here are the proposed changes to the regulations (as stated on the Dept. of Labor website):
– To more clearly define the tasks that may be performed by an exempt companion
– To limit the companionship exemption to companions employed only by the family or household using the services. Third party employers, such as in-home care staffing agencies, could not claim the exemption, even if the employee is jointly employed by the third party and the family or household.
This change in the ruling simply closes an “exemption” on a federal level which was never intended for the home care industry. It’s a positive ruling in the sense it provides for the fair treatment of all overtime worked and paid as a new standard in our industry. It truly legitimizes our industry to insure business practices are standardized across the board for caregivers and all employees who earn hourly compensation. The increasing demand for non-medical care services is being fueled by many demographic, societal, economic and cultural factors and this change in the DOL ruling was expected to occur eventually. It is unfortunate that many of the companies in our industry have chosen to operate using this exemption as a standard practice for many years, but now cry foul as if an entitlement has been taken away.
One belief among those in the home care industry is that this ruling will raise healthcare costs while lowering the quality of care received. For those companies in our industry who do not closely manage caregivers and hours worked, this will create a major challenge to their continued margins and will likely affect their cost structure leading to a potential decline in the quality of care. However, for those who have maintained fair practices of paying overtime from the start, the quality of care should not be affected at all. Pricing for services may be adjusted upward for live-in clients who choose this level of care only, but this is also not a large contingent of clientele. There are service and care options which clients can freely choose that enable care to be maintained without sacrificing quality.
The lobbying and protesting of this ruling of many prominent home care agencies only serves to keep our industry in a small, exemption-driven position when it is truly one of the fastest-growing segments of healthcare, and, serves to divide providing companies in our industry instead of uniting all companies under the proper employment practices to value our caregivers as they deserve."

238,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/does-fear-lead-to-falls/,"According to a new study, the answer is yes.
Research released this week by Sydney, Australia-based medical publisher BMJ indicated that older adults who have a fear of falling are at an increased risk for future falls, regardless of physical risk assessment. The study included 500 people, aged 70 to 90, who underwent extensive medical and psychological tests that estimated the participants’ actual and perceived fall risks. Those with a high level of anxiety about falling were mostly like to endure a spill.
The risk of falling can always be minimized with the aid of an in-home care giver, regardless of physical limitations or mental anxieties. As a caregiver, it’s important to assuage the fears that may be causing a loved one uneasiness. FirstLight Home Care strives to help all of our clients by not only being aware of their fears but providing them the kind of compassionate support that will allow them to continue their lives to fullest.

Keepers
Their marriage was good, their dreams focused. their best friends lived barely a wave away. I can see them now, Dad in trousers, tee shirt and a hat and Mom in a house dress; lawn mower in his hand, and dish-towel in hers. It was the time for fixing things … A curtain rod, the kitchen radio, screen door, the oven door, the hem in a dress. Things we keep.
It was a way of life, and sometimes it made me crazy. All that re-fixing, eating, renewing, I wanted just once to be wasteful … Waste meant affluence. Throwing things away meant you knew there would always be more.
But then my mother died, and on that clear summer’s night, in the warmth of the hospital room, I was struck with the pain of learning that sometimes there isn’t any more. Sometimes, what we care about most gets all used up and goes away……never to return. So … While we have it … It’s best we love it … And care for it … And fix it when it’s broken … And heal it when it’s sick.
This is true … For marriage … And old cars … And children with bad report cards … Dogs and cats with bad hips … And aging parents … And grandparents, aunts and uncles and friends. We keep them because they are worth it, because we are worth it.
Some things we keep. Like a best friend who moved away or a classmate we grew up with. There are just some things that make life important, like people we know who are special. And so, we keep them close in heart and mind and spirit.
I received this from someone who thinks I am a “keeper,” so I’ve sent it to the people I think of in the same way.
Now it’s your turn to send this to those people who are “keepers” in your life. Send it back to the person that sent it to you if they too are a keeper.
Good friends are like stars…
You don’t always see them,
but you know they are always there."
239,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/donating-blood/,"January is National Blood Donor Month. If you have donated blood to an organization like the American Red Cross, thank you. If you’ve never donated blood but are interested, here are a few reasons why you should donate this month and in future months.
Blood is essential for life: it carries oxygen and nutrients throughout the body, fights infections, and helps heal wounds. And everyone has this self-generating resource that can be generously given to others—when and where it is needed most.
- Your donation will save lives. Every time you donate you can save the lives of as many as 3 people in need.
- You make a big impact in little time. Donating blood takes about one hour. Within 10 days, your blood will have already reached someone in need.
- More than 4.5 million patients need blood transfusions each year in the U.S. and Canada (Blood Centers of the Pacific).
- Blood contains many life-saving components that can help to treat different illnesses and injuries. For many people, blood donors are their life-line.
- Donating blood reduces the chances of ischemic heart diseases (beginning of heart problems) as frequent donations reduce the accumulated and unwanted iron load from the body.
If you’ve never given blood, you might be nervous doing so. It’s actually a fairly straight forward process. Click here to learn more."
240,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/driving-and-dementia/,"The American Academy of Neurology issued a new guideline to help doctors and families determine when someone diagnosed with dementia is no longer able to safely drive. Unfortunately, the release was a bit softer than many would hope. Their findings were that many of those who have dementia will eventually have to quit driving due to their symptoms, but not that everyone who has dementia should stop driving immediately, or when they should stop at all.
The biggest problem is that symptoms are hard to gauge, and there’s no real way of setting a standard. Though many people might say they feel they’re able to drive, they might not be able to pass a driving exam.
No matter how you look at it, it’s never easy to give up your keys. After all, you’re giving up a part of your independence, and I don’t know anyone who can say they’re ever happy to do that. What makes it even harder is that many seniors rely on their cars to pick up valuable things, such as groceries and medications, and for that matter, keep active in their social lives.
It’s because of reasons like these that we’re so passionate about transportation services, such as the ones we offer at FirstLight Home Care. These services allow people to continue enjoying their lives, while easing the worries of their loved ones.
Caregivers can take people anywhere they need to go, from meeting up with friends to getting groceries, while making sure that their passengers get in and out of the car safely. Most importantly, you’ll know that the person behind the wheel is able to react to any driving hazard."
241,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/early-signs-of-alzheimers/,"June is Alzheimer’s and Brain Awareness Month.
Alzheimer’s is a brain disease that causes a slow decline in memory, thinking, and reasoning skills. Currently, worldwide, 50 million people are living with Alzheimer’s and other related dementias.
As more people face a future with this disease, it is important that we focus on early diagnosis. The earlier the detection, the earlier you can take advantage of the various treatment opportunities and support services available to live a quality life.
There are 10 early warning signs and symptoms of Alzheimer’s. If you notice any of these in your loved one, it may be time to seek additional care.
- Memory loss that disrupts daily life is one of the most common early warning signs of Alzheimer’s. As we age, we can become forgetful – that alone does not mean Alzheimer’s. But memory loss related to recently learned information, as well as asking the same questions over and over could be an early sign.
- Daily situations dealing with numbers or solving problems become difficult. Things like balancing a checkbook, following a recipe, or keeping track of monthly bills may become frustrating to complete.
- People with Alzheimer’s often find it hard to complete simple daily tasks like driving to a familiar location, remembering the rules of a favorite game or organizing their day.
- Conversations become difficult. Finding the right words or needing more time to stop and gather thoughts when in conversations with others may be an initial sign of Alzheimer’s.
- Losing track of dates, seasons and the passing of time, or getting confused about where they are or how they got there become more common.
- Vision problems such as having trouble understanding visual images, judging distancing, and determining color or contrast is an early sign of Alzheimer’s.
- Difficulty in speaking or writing. Struggling with vocabulary, having trouble naming an object or use the wrong name for something could be a red flag.
- Misplacing things and losing the ability to retrace steps to find them again becomes difficult.
- Experiencing changes in judgment or poor decision-making is a concern, especially when it comes to dealing with money, personal hygiene, etc.
- Mood and personality changes are also a sign. Someone living with Alzheimer’s may become confused, suspicious, depressed, fearful or anxious.
If you or a loved one is experiencing one or more these symptoms, make an appointment to discuss concerns with your doctor. Early detection matters. What you may be experiencing could be early signs of Alzheimer’s, or something else. It is important to act and figure out what is going on as soon as possible.
FirstLight HomeCare is proud to CHAMPION the family caregiver, offering empathy, advice, and support for those who provide countless hours of care to their loved ones living with Alzheimer’s. We want to provide a helping hand, relieve some of the stress that comes with caregiving and give you back a few hours in your overwhelmingly busy day.

242,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/early-signs-of-parkinsons-disease/,"April is Parkinson’s Awareness Month, and FirstLight® Home Care is honored to support the needs of those affected by Parkinson’s disease.
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system that impacts more than 10 million people worldwide. The neurological disorder affects movement, and it typically develops gradually. For example, it may start with a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand.
In early stages of the disease, your face may show little or no expression, or your arms may not swing when you walk. Your speech may become soft or slurred. And, unfortunately, Parkinson’s disease symptoms worsen as your condition progresses over time.
Parkinson’s can’t be cured, but medical advancements have improved symptoms. Some signs and symptoms of the disease may include:
- Tremors. Tremors are the most recognizable sign of Parkinson’s disease. A tremor, or shaking, usually begins in a limb, often your hand or fingers when relaxed or at rest. Some people also may experience a back-and-forth rubbing of the thumb and forefinger, known as a pill-rolling tremor.
- Stiffness and slowed movement. Over time, Parkinson’s disease may reduce your ability to move. Slowness in your movement will make simple tasks, like getting out of a chair, difficult and time-consuming.
- Loss of smell. Trouble smelling foods like bananas, dill pickles or licorice can be an early sign of the disease.
- Trouble moving or walking. Stiffness or pain in your body, arms, and legs that do not go away as you move can be an early sign.
- Voice changes. The disease affects movement in different ways, including how you speak. Slurred speech is common in advanced stages of Parkinson’s. Less dramatic voice changes can occur in early stages of the disease. Enunciation may remain crystal clear, but what you might experience is unintentionally speaking more quietly. People in early stages of Parkinson’s often speak in low tones, a hoarse voice, or with little inflection.
- Impaired posture and balance. Your posture may become stooped, or you may have balance problems.
- Writing changes. It may become hard to write, and your writing may appear small.
Because Parkinson’s disease is progressive, and symptoms worsen over time, many people living with Parkinson’s seek long-term assistance to help manage day-to-day activities. FirstLight caregivers can help these individuals maintain independence and protect their quality of life by providing:
- Assistance with daily activities, such as bathing, hygiene and meal preparation
- Help with walking and mobility, as well as transfer and posture
- Medication reminders to continue the treatment regimens that are critical to managing physical symptoms of the disease
- Transportation to and from doctor’s appointment, social engagements, and other activities
- Household help, such as light housekeeping and laundry
- Companionship to help battle the anxiety and depression that often come with the disease
- Respite care to provide relief to family caregivers who are essential to the ongoing support of those living with the disease

243,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/earth-day-can-benefit-life/,"Welcome to April 22, otherwise known around the world as Earth Day. First celebrated 46 years ago, this annual event is a day where people from California to Sydney are encouraged to come together and channel energy to help the environment become even more beautiful and sustainable.
For your entire family and all the loved ones you care for, Earth Day is a great opportunity to celebrate your surroundings and improve your health at the same time. So, if you’re looking for ways to celebrate this global day of goodwill, here are some top tips from our team of caregivers:
- Plant a tree: For 2016, the Earth Day Network is encouraging everyone to help the foundation by planting trees. From now until the 50th anniversary in 2020, the goal is to plant 7.8 million trees to help our planet recover from pollution faster. When planting yours, we recommend involving your entire family, from old to young, so everyone can contribute. You can even make it a friendly competition between family members to see who can plant the most.
- Clean up and recycle: Clutter, junk mail, old technology and various plastics tend to build up in and around your loved one’s homes, leading to billions of tons of litter in our oceans and landfills. By taking the time to go through your and your loved one’s belongings, and recycle what can be recycled, you can help in a universal effort to reduce our unusable garbage.
- Buy local: For busy families and elderly individuals, grocery stores are convenient solutions for produce and other perishable goods. However, by the time they’ve reached the store, foods have typically lost nearly 45 percent of their original nutrients, and the energy needed to ship it produces damaging CO2 emissions. By shopping local for your produce, you’re not only getting more nutritious food, you’re helping reduce the lost energy needed to bring produce to grocery stores. Too busy to handle this for your loved ones on your own? Senior companion care services can help with local groceries so your loved ones can celebrate Earth Day with tasty and sustainable produce.
- Garden and compost: Gardening has been proven to help adults age better, but did you know adding composting to the activity can help you and the planet at the same time? Each year, billions of pounds of food are simply thrown away, this equates to one third of all food produced for the entire human population. Composting with food scraps, leaves and grass can not only help your garden grow, it can help the planet reduce its overall landfill spread.
While these tips can help, we encourage you and your entire family to find fun and interactive ways to embrace Earth Day now and for the rest of the year. While getting everyone involved, including the older individuals in your life, may seem tough, it doesn’t have to be. Every day, we connect with people just like you to help them overcome the challenges of acting as a caregiver. To get the help you’re looking for, make sure to “Just Ask FirstLight” for questions relating to home care, illness, and even activities for seniors."
244,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/easter-holiday-offers-chance-to-connect-with-elderly-loved-ones/,"Another holiday has arrived and for many people, holidays equal family, food and fun. This can be especially exciting for seniors who don’t have the opportunity to spend a lot of quality time with friends and loved ones. Regardless of the religious beliefs of the seniors involved, Easter is a good opportunity to welcome the spring season and engage in Easter-related activities. If you’re planning a get-together this weekend, here are a few fun activities that will surely put a smile on your senior’s face.
Prep time
If you’re hosting the shindig, invite your elderly family members or friends over to help decorate, prepare place settings for guests or put the finishing touches on food offerings or dessert. They’ll appreciate the gesture and be pleased they get to lend a hand in planning something for the family.
Get crafty
Dyeing eggs and decorating Easter baskets is a fun pastime for many families. These are great, hands-on craft projects for seniors to partake in because there are no sharp tools involved and they are simple and easy. Helping organize an Easter egg hunt for the younger family members is another way seniors can contribute to the party. It also allows them to spend quality time with grandchildren, who they might not have the chance to see often.
Go to church
Many seniors may be interested in going to a local church service. If you’re not able to attend a church service, see if there are any senior services or music at a local community senior center. A day of singing and music can make the holiday special for your elderly loved one.
Even if you aren’t able to visit your elderly loved one in person, make it a point this Easter holiday to give them a call to catch up or pop a nice card in the mail to let them know they’re in your thoughts."
245,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/eat-more-fruits-and-veggies/,"In the past five years, fruit and vegetable intake among Americans has fallen – especially in regard to older individuals. A 2015 survey conducted by the Produce for Better Health Foundation discovered a 7 percent per capita decline, but for people 45 and older, the drop is even more significant.
Even though adults 65 and older tend to be the highest consumers of fruits and vegetables, some senior adults may not understand the importance of eating these vibrant and healthful foods. As senior caregivers, we understand how essential fruits and veggies are, but we also understand how easy it can be to avoid them in favor of pre-packed snacks and fast food. If you want to add a little more color to your diet, here’s how to eat more fruits and vegetables and actually like them!
- Foods for vitamins: If you take a pill for vitamin A and C to help your immunity, bone development and eye health, try sourcing these nutrients through food instead. By ditching the pill, you’ll be obligated to eat more colorful vegetables such as carrots, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, and red peppers. Leafy greens such as spinach, collards and turnip greens are a great source of vitamin A and C, while sweet fruits like kiwi, strawberries and cantaloupe can help your body get the vitamin C it deserves.
- Put your fruit on display: If you see colorful fruits, you’re more likely to actually eat them. Take some time to create a center piece for your kitchen table and fill it with decorative offerings like apples, oranges, bananas, grapefruit, cantaloupe and kiwi. After you eat the fruits, you’ll be inclined to buy more so that your new decoration always looks full and inviting.
- Challenge yourself: Because everyone likes a victory, set a personal challenge to help keep your fruit and veggie intake up. Whether it’s mastering a new recipe with fruits and vegetables, hitting a daily quota, or trying new foods, putting a goal for a number of fruits and vegetables to eat a day will help keep you motivated to improve your diet and your health.
As we age, staying healthy means being mindful of what we eat. By encouraging yourself and your loved ones to consume more fruits and vegetables, you’re encouraging a better way of life.

246,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/elder-neglect-how-to-identify-the-signs-and-help/,"As our country’s population continues to age, elder neglect is becoming a growing concern among families and health and human rights activists. Though instances of it are on the rise, it’s an issue that often goes underreported. This is simply because victims are typically frail, ill or dealing with conditions, like dementia.
To protect an elderly loved one from neglect, it’s vital to understand what it is and to recognize common signs and symptoms.
What is Elder Neglect?
Elder neglect falls under the category of elder abuse as defined by the National Center on Elder Abuse. It occurs when a caregiver refuses or fails to fulfill their obligations or duties to an elderly person. For instance, a caregiver might not give an individual the food, water or medicine they need to stay healthy. In a medical setting, such as a nursing home, it includes:
- Not administering medications when needed or giving incorrect doses
- Giving conflicting medications or those with excessive side effects
- Not moving those with mobility issues as often as needed, increasing their risk for bed sores
- Not reporting signs of illness or infection
- Not properly caring for those with health problems like diabetes or dementia
- Excessively using physical or medical restraints
Who Commits Elder Neglect?
Neglect can come from many sources. Adult children are the most common perpetrators of elder neglect, followed by spouses and other family members. It can also happen at the hands of a professional caregiver in the home or at a medical facility or even by the senior themselves.
What are the Risk Factors?
According to the American Psychological Association, most victims of elder abuse are female, while most perpetrators are male. In addition, specific health conditions and other circumstances put certain groups at a higher risk for elder neglect. These include:
- Older Seniors: Those over 80 are more likely to suffer from elder abuse, according to a medical study from Northwestern University and Rush University researchers.
- More Vulnerable Seniors: Seniors with poor cognitive function and greater physical dependability are also at an increased risk for neglect. The more reliant a senior is on help with everyday tasks, the more susceptible they are to the potential for neglect or abuse.
- Isolated Seniors: Those living alone are at a higher risk for neglect and abuse, according to the National Council on Aging. This typically affects widows, seniors without family and other elderly adults aging alone.
What Are the Common Signs of Elder Neglect?
Elder neglect can be difficult to spot since seniors are more prone to falls, accidents, changes in behavior and memory issues. However, if you’re concerned, there are some red flags to be aware of, including:
- Poor Appearance and Hygiene: Your loved one may appear dirty, smell like urine or feces or wear unwashed or seasonally inappropriate clothing.
- A Sudden Physical Decline: Some indications include weight loss, missed medications or doctors appointments, regular illness or infection, skin issues or a sudden decline in energy. Other signs include bruises, lacerations, broken bones and other unexplained injuries.
- Personality Changes: Neglect can also be the source if your loved one appears confused or depressed for no reason, withdraws socially or has an unexpected negative reaction to physical touch.
- Dirty Living Conditions: If your loved one’s living conditions are unusually messy or dirty or not kept at an appropriate temperature for the season, neglect could be the cause.
What Should You Do if You Suspect Elder Neglect?
If you’re noticing potential signs of elder neglect, take detailed notes and photographs, so you can document the situation. This is particularly important if there are injuries of any kind. Also make sure you write down any different behaviors or issues you’ve noticed and the dates. If your loved one is in a medical facility, start checking in more regularly with in-person visits. Be on the lookout for any of the common signs and talk to your loved one about their experience there.
If you’re concerned a family member is the source of the neglect, address the topic calmly and directly with them. Don’t make accusations. Your family member will be more likely to open up and share what’s going on. If you have witnessed elder neglect or suspect it, then you need to report it. If you believe your loved one is in immediate danger, call 9-1-1.
For less urgent situations, you can call the National Center for Elder Abuse, Adult Protective Services, or the Long-Term Care Ombudsman in your local area. The Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program advocates for residents of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, board and care homes and similar adult care homes.
If you’re concerned about issues like elder neglect and would like to hire a professional, responsive and compassionate caregiver for your loved one, contact your local FirstLight® Home Care today. We can ensure your loved one is safe, happy and comfortable, wherever they call home."
247,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/elderl-law/,"China recently passed the “Elderly Rights Law” legally obligating children to visit their parents who are 60 years and older “frequently” and provide for their “financial and spiritual needs.” Failure to comply with this law can result in fines, lawsuits or jail time. Although there is no time limit on how often a child must visit his aging parents, the law was in response to the growing number of elderly neglected by their children.
“I hope this type of legislation will never be necessary in the United States now or the future,” says Jeff Bevis, CEO of FirstLight Home Care, a leading provider of in-home care. “The need for compassionate, considerate, quality care on a non-medical basis is growing dramatically all across the US. We provide a much-needed service, especially for seniors, no matter whether their immediate or extended families are nearby or across the country. There are a host of demographic, societal, cultural and economic reasons our services are seeing growing demand. For us taking care of the elderly who want to stay in their own homes is not an obligation, it’s a passion.”
What The Statistics Show
According to the Administration on Aging, there were 39.6M Americans ages 65 and over in 2009. By 2030, there will be approximately 72.1 million older persons, more than twice their number in 2000. In fact, it is predicted that the U.S. elderly population will grow by nearly 80 percent in the next 25 years — a “graying” trend that’s only more pronounced in other developed countries. In fact, the United States has more people aged 80 and over and is second only to China in that category.
The Associated Press reports that in China, there are currently 185 million people over the age of 60. By 2053, that number will skyrocket to 485 million, or 35 percent of the population.
Without a doubt, both countries face challenges in how to care for the growing population of elderly. It used to be a part of Chinese culture for parents to live with their kids. However, both the one-child policy and “three decades of economic reforms have accelerated the decline of the traditional extended family.” And unfortunately, more than 1/5 of the elderly live below the poverty line.
“The traditional family support system is eroding for many reasons and I think the government would like to slow this process down,” said Albert Park, the director of the Emerging Markets Institute at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
The law also states that children should pay a monthly allowance to their parents if they refuse to take care of them and conversely, parents can sue their children for negligence. In fact, shortly after the law went into effect, a woman in Wuxi was ordered by a local court to see her 77-year-old mother twice a month and provide financial support.
In fact, less than two weeks after the law was passed, more than 100 new online elderly care providers sprang up on Taobao.com, one of China’s biggest shopping sites.
Putting A Price on Family Love and Loyalty
Adults sons and daughters in the United States have many of their own dilemmas. How do you juggle working full-time, your own family and still have time to emotionally and physically support your parents? How do you take care of your parents if they live far away? How do you provide financial support to your parents when you can’t fulfill your own obligations?
“Without a doubt there are many pressures on families today to provide for their aging parents,” says Bevis. “That is why our services and the entire ‘new industry’ of non-medical care providers are a good solution for providing personal and companion care to the elderly whose loved ones simply can’t be there for a myriad of reasons.”
“However, I think putting a price tag on time or legislation for financial support could do more to erode the family, than help it,” concluded Bevis."
248,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/elderl-prescription-drug-safety/,"Persons aged 65 years and older comprise only 13 percent of the population, yet account for more than one-third of total outpatient spending on prescription medications in the United States*.
If you are older, or the caregiver for someone that currently takes multiple prescription medications simultaneously to treat different conditions and symptoms, mismanagement of any medication can be harmful and could lead to hospitalization or even death.
In 2016, the American Family Physician publication reported that one in six hospital admissions of older adults is because of a medication error, a proportion that is four times that of younger people. For adults over 75 years, hospital admissions because of medication mismanagement increased even further to one in three.*
What can you do to prevent a medication mismanagement with an elderly family member or as a caregiver to an elderly person? Here is some advice to keep in mind:
- Create and maintain an up-to-date medication list, including Providers: Keep an accurate list of both prescription and over-the-counter medication and herbal supplements being taken. Include the dosages, dosing frequency, reason for taking the drug, and potential side effects. Keep the list up-to-date and placed in a location that is easily accessible to the patient or other caregivers that are supporting the elderly person.
- Properly store medication: Make sure the daily pills are stored in a secure, dry location away from light. Refrigerate medications if necessary.
- Stay true to one pharmacy: To better manage a person’s medication and prescription renewal, use only one pharmacy to obtain drugs.
- Educate: Confirm that the person taking the medication and the caregiver helping an older patient with his or her medication understands what they are taking, including the name, purpose, effects and potential adverse effects and interactions of each mediation.
- Dispose of old medications properly and avoid sharing medication.
- Doctor Visits: When going to a doctor’s appointment, take your medication list, or bring your medication and supplements with you to help your doctor or pharmacist understand what you are taking. This will help them to identify if there are any potential adverse effects you should know.
- Ask questions: If you have questions about what medication you are taking, side effects that you are having, or any other concerns, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
- Use tools to help monitor the dosage and dosing frequency: Taking medication several times a day can be confusing. To help an elderly person or the caregiver to manage medication intake, use tools such as a medication reminder chart, check list or a pill organizer box. Keep all medications in one place. Set a schedule for taking medications and if necessary, set an alarm to help you remember.
If you, or someone you care for is taking several different medications each day, it can be overwhelming. But if you understand the medication, follow the doctor’s instructions, stay on schedule, and ask questions to your doctor or pharmacist if don’t understand a medication or notice new symptoms/issues when taking your medication, you can prevent medicine mismanagement.

*Reducing the Risk of Adverse Drug Events in Older Adults, American Family Physician, March 2013"
249,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/elderly-fall-prevention-tips-senior-home-care/,"According to the National Council on Aging (NCOA), falls are the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal injuries for older Americans. One in four older Americans experience a fall annually. At FirstLight®, our goal is to provide senior home care that makes your loved ones feel safe. Elderly fall prevention is just one way we care for your loved ones as if they were our own. Read on to learn more about fall prevention for seniors.
What Are The Dangers Of Seniors Falling?
Falls threaten seniors’ safety and independence. They are a substantial medical risk that can result in hip fractures, cuts and sometimes life-threatening head and brain injuries. Oftentimes, a fall is so scary that seniors may avoid certain activities because they are worried that they’ll fall again. So, how important is senior fall prevention?
Elderly fall prevention can greatly improve the quality of life in our seniors. The data is startling. Sixty and Me, an online community of 500,000 women over 60, provided some very helpful information that explores basic statistics related to falls in older Americans. For example, “more than one in every three falls involving older adults either requires medical assistance, such as going to a regular doctor’s appointment or a trip to the emergency room, or results in activity limitations for a day or more.” Falls are too common. We need to work together to learn about fall prevention to keep our aging family and friends healthy.
If you are a family caregiver, the following quick guide to elderly fall prevention can help keep your aging loved one safe inside the place they call home and provide you with comfort and peace of mind.
Most Common Fall Risks For Elderly
- Carrying excessive amounts of weight.
- Having poor balance.
- Wearing impractical shoes.
- Having pathways in the home filled with clutter or objects.
- Standing up to dress or undress.
- Slipping in the shower or tub.
- Lighting is not bright enough in rooms.
- Having poor vision.
- Being on medication with side effects such as drowsiness or dizziness.
- Getting feet caught in wheelchair feet supports.
Senior Fall Prevention Strategies
Although falls are not a normal part of aging, most of us lose some coordination, flexibility and balance as we age. This can increase our potential to fall. Elderly fall prevention is the best way to counteract the negative effects of a fall before it happens. Here are some ways to help prevent falls in your elderly loved one.
Remove clutter.
The simplest way to promote fall prevention is to remove clutter from floors, hallways, staircases and sidewalks around your loved one’s home. Unnecessary clutter can be a tripping hazard. Plus, your loved one is at risk of losing their balance and falling when they bend down to pick up the clutter.
Fix trip hazards.
Walk through every room of the house and identify potential trip hazards. Fix, remove, or repair items such as loose carpets, throw rugs, uneven flooring, electrical cords or unnecessary furniture, as well as things like old newspapers and magazines that may be piled up. Patterned rugs, especially, can cause a tripping hazard because they affect depth perception.
Keep necessary items within reach.
Limiting overreaching can be a great form of fall prevention. The potential of falling is minimized by not placing anything on shelves that are too high or need to be reached using a chair or ladder. In their bedroom specifically, your loved one’s bed should be a comfortable height, stable and firm enough to get in and out of easily. A telephone and lamp should be reachable on the bedside table. Eyeglasses, canes and walkers should also be easily accessible.
Keep the bathroom safe.
Buying rubberized slip-resistant mats both inside and outside of the shower or tub helps prevent slipping. A raised toilet seat makes it easier and safer for someone who is weak or has balance problems.
Install grab bars and handrails.
Hire a handyman or have a family member install grab bars by toilets and bathtubs and handrails in stairways and hallways. Most seniors have lived in their homes for such a long time they may have never thought about making simple home modifications that could make aging in place a viable and safer option.
Install proper lighting.
Poor lighting is another hazard that can cause falls. Install brighter light bulbs in each room for everyday use. Add night lights in bedrooms and bathrooms for better guidance at night. Light switches should be accessible at room entrances and at the beginning of any dark area. Automatic touch lights that turn on when you touch the base of the lamp are helpful for those with arthritis or painful joints. Adapters are available to convert existing lamps into touch-sensitive lamps.
Encourage shoes, even in the home.
Preventing falls at home can be as simple as wearing sensible shoes. Socks might be more comfortable, but they can also be slippery. Encourage your loved one to wear shoes, even inside the house. Shoes should have low heels and good tread.
Make sure to keep shoelaces tied or Velcro firmly fastened. If your loved one chooses to wear slippers, they should have rubber soles and should not be worn outside.
Remember outdoor safety.
Step edges should be marked with reflective tape that is designed for outdoor use. Traction tape on stair treads will minimize the chance of falls when the stairs are wet. Using a contrasting color adhesive strip along the edge of the threshold will make it more visible. Leaves, moss, snow and ice can cause serious falls. Paths and sidewalks that are raised and cracked create a hazard.
Promote balance.
Get a shower bench or chair for someone if they are unsteady on their feet. Balance can be easily thrown off by trying to carry heavy objects and having vision obscured.
Look into medication information.
Review all medications with your loved one’s the physician or pharmacist to see if there is an increased risk for falls. Some drugs that contribute to falls are diuretics, blood pressure medicine and medications given for psychological reasons.
Review walker and wheelchair safety.
When using a walker, both hands must be free to grasp the handles on either side. Avoid carrying heavy objects, which could cause a loss of balance or overload a wheelchair. Wheelchairs should be checked periodically to make sure they are in good working condition.
Urge your older adult to slow down.
Teaching aging adults that they are not as agile as they used to be is a helpful way to promote senior fall prevention. Many falls at home are caused by your elderly loved one moving too quickly while getting in or out of a seated position. Advise them to pause before sitting or standing to make sure they are steady before moving.
Emergency alarm systems provide peace of mind.
Personal Emergency Response Systems (PERS) provide emergency help at the press of a button, 24 hours a day. While not a form of fall prevention, if you are not able to have an actual person in the home with your loved one, these devices are an effective way to alert others of a fall. The response button is worn around the neck, on the belt or on the wrist of your loved one. These systems help alleviate the fear of being alone during an emergency such as a fall.

250,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/elderly-parents-living-alone/,"Elderly parents want to remain living independently, but it can be a struggle as they decline in physical or mental abilities. But when they are determined to do so, what do you do?
AARP reported earlier this year that 80 to 90 percent of aging people, including our elderly parents, would choose to reside in their own homes for as long as possible, as opposed to choosing to live in a nursing home or independent care facility. This desire by your elderly parents to live independently can make it challenging for the adult child/children who is caring for them. .
Many adult children also prefer that their elderly parents or loved ones stay in their own home so that they maintain their independence and active lifestyle. However, this situation can often become very stressful for the family because leaving an aging parent home alone can create additional worry. What if they slip and fall with no one around to help? What if they are unable to follow hospital discharge regimens or daily routines on their own?
Should you and your elderly family member decide that aging at home is the best living situation, here are a few important items to consider:
- Home Preparedness: If your elderly parents are going to remain in their home, you should work with them to ensure the home is safe by removing potential hazards both indoors and out. Remove trip hazards like throw rugs, clutter, light cords and other items on the floor. Install handrails in the shower or bathtub to avoid any falls. Add adequate outdoor lighting and handrails around the outside of the home as well. Check our August 2016 blog post: “Essential Safety Tips for Seniors Living Alone” for additional home improvements to help seniors remain safe at home.
- Health Care Plan: Many older adults take medications daily. Develop a plan to ensure they are following the directions of their doctor. Start by making a list of the medicines the doctor has prescribed, as well as any over-the-counter products (vitamins and herbal supplements) they are taking. Go to your parent’s next doctor’s appointment to better understand their medical needs, and work with the doctor and/or pharmacist to understand dosage amount and daily schedule. Find the right pillbox or dispenser that would work best for them. There are basic day-of-the-week cups to four-times-a-day expanded versions. There are also electronic versions and even talking pillboxes that can be helpful for family members with vision loss.
- Healthy Meal Preparation: Eating properly each day is essential for physical and emotional well-being. If your elderly parents are unable or don’t want the stress of driving themselves to the store to grocery shop, they need a support system in place. Solutions like Meals on Wheels, where volunteers deliver meals to home-bound family members, or online grocery shopping with local home delivery, are options. FirstLight Home Care provides Companion Care services where our caregivers work with your aging parents to determine the grocery list and help them with their grocery shopping. They can also help with meal preparation and other personal assistance.
- Emotional Needs: It is important for your elderly parents to have connections and activities outside of the home. Maintaining engagement within the community can support an elderly person’s feeling of connection with the world beyond his/her family. It is important that they don’t spend every day alone. FirstLight Home Care can provide in-home visits or help them get to doctor appointments, errands, or lunch with friends.
Caring for an aging parent who is living independently can be challenging if you cannot be there 24/7.

251,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/email-etiquette-for-seniors/,"It’s a well-known fact that technology is present in many aspects of our everyday lives. For those of us who have been raised alongside the advancements in the tech industry, simple things like email have become second nature. Seniors, however, may not be as adept when it comes to using computers, let along communicating via email. Here are simple steps and tips you can do to help your elderly loved one get more comfortable with their inbox.
• If they don’t already have an email account, help them set one up on a free, easy-to-use platform such as Gmail or Yahoo!. Be sure to write down usernames and passwords in a secure place.
• Make sure to check their spam settings and explain the prevalence of email scammers that try to take advantage of elderly users.
• Explain the importance and danger of attachments. Often times, attachments contain the bulk of the information associated with the email. However, attachments can also be a source of detrimental computer viruses when sent from an unknown source or if they are downloaded improperly.
• Review the difference between an informal and a formal email. Informal emails are meant for family and friends, often containing pictures and stories. These emails are intended to be causal, reflecting the author’s personality and sense of humor! On the other hand, formal emails are reserved for more neutral audiences, such as community organizations. Formal emails should contain proper language and be void of any emoticons.
Learning email etiquette, or even email in general, can be tricky for anyone! The most important thing is to remain positive. Email can be a great resource for seniors, keeping them in touch with friends and family.

Unless you plan on heading south for the next 5 months to avoid the cold, you need to get prepared. Winter can be a challenge, so you need to find the bright side. We’ve put together a list of things you can do to embrace old man winter and make the most of it.
- Make a bird/squirrel feeder. Snow, frozen ground, and lack of vegetation makes it hard for wildlife to find food. Make simple feeders out of peanut butter and seed to hang from the trees. Place it near a window where you can watch them enjoy the feeder you made.
- Plan a game night. Winter’s cold nights keep us indoors. Invite your family, friends, or neighbors to come over and sit around the table and do something together that is fun.
- Cook something new. Go through all the recipes you told yourself “you’re going to make one day” and make one of them. Plan to do this each week and invite someone new each time to join you in the fun. Make enough for the meal that night, but also for meals later in the week.
- Movie night. Go to your local library and pick out a few movies that you’ve always wanted to see – or even those that you’ve seen many times. Get the blankets out, find the best spot on the couch, and watch your movies.
- Write a letter. Get out your paper and pen and write a letter to or call someone you have not been in touch with for a while. Let them know what you miss about them or share a precious memory.
- Get outdoors. Check out what’s happening at your local museum, art center, senior center, or concert hall and plan to attend. Dress warm and sensible, including non-skid boots and you’ll be set for any local outing.

253,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/emergency-preparedness-for-seniors/,"Thursday’s string of natural disasters, which caused destruction and tragedy in Japan, Hawaii and on the Western coast of the U.S., have raised prominent questions and concerns for friends, family members and caregivers of the elderly. How can we keep our elderly loved ones safe when natural disasters occur? Here are some tips on preparing the elderly for emergencies:
Natural disasters
Although some disasters can be difficult to prepare for, it’s important to have a plan in place to escape to safety where your senior can notify you of what is happening. Knowing the steps to take in the event of flooding, tornadoes, hurricanes, brush fires or earthquakes offers some piece of mind and will give your elderly loved one a sense of purpose during a time when they might otherwise not know what to do.
House fire
First and foremost, an escape route from every room in the house needs to be established and practiced routinely. Check all exits frequently for repair and ensure they remain valid escape routes and devoid of clutter. A course of action to take after the fire also needs to be planned in advance. This includes having him or her get in touch with you and emergency response services as well as having a plan to put into place to deal with insurance and the aftermath of a fire.
Burglaries
While this is a very scary situation, it can happen to anyone at any time no matter how safe a neighborhood might be. Consider installing an alarm system in your senior’s home. Once installed, it’s important that he or she knows how to activate and deactivate the alarm and makes sure to set it regularly. Your senior should also have a plan for what to do if a break-in occurs while he or she is at home.
Having a plan for when disaster strikes seems like common sense but where seconds can make a life-changing difference, it’s important for seniors to have a well-rehearsed course of action. Contact your local FirstLight Home Care office to learn more the steps you can take to ensure your elderly loved one’s well-being in an emergency."
254,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/empowering-older-adult-tips-taking-control-health/,"October isn’t just about falling leaves, candy corn and jack-o-lanterns. It’s also Health Literacy Month, Organize Your Medical Information Month and Talk About Your Medicines Month. Are all of these observances trying to tell us something?
Numerous studies have shown that people who are engaged in their health have better health outcomes. That’s why October is a good time to resolve to be informed, get organized and start a conversation. Following are tips to help older adults – and their family caregivers – take control of their health during October, and every month throughout the year.
Be informed during Health Literacy Month
In days gone by, people were predisposed to simply following doctor’s orders, without asking questions or seeking to understand their roles in their own health. Today, with access to better information and more collaborative medical professionals, we can all be more involved in the process.
That involvement relies on better understanding of diagnoses, prevention and treatment. But according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, nearly 9 out of 10 adults may lack the skills needed to manage their health and prevent disease.
Health literacy is “the degree to which individuals are able to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.” Adults with low health literacy tend to have higher rates of hospitalization, less frequent use of preventive services and, ultimately, higher healthcare costs.
How can you improve your health literacy? Follow these tips to get started:
- Ask questions. Don’t be afraid to ask your doctor for clarification. And keep asking until you understand.
- Attend a class. Many healthcare organizations provide classes about health conditions. Ask your doctor for a schedule.
- Make sure you understand any action you need to take. Consider repeating instructions back to your provider to confirm you’re on the same page.
- Take advantage of health educators or patient navigators. Many hospitals and physician practices now offer professionals to help you navigate diagnosis and treatment.
- Plan for your doctor’s visits. Consider keeping a notebook to document questions and record what you learn during your appointments.
- Team up. Another set of ears can help enhance health literacy. If you’re a family caregiver, consider accompanying your loved one to appointments to ask questions and serve as an advocate.
- Seek out user-friendly information. There’s no shortage of online information to help manage your health. But not all sites were designed to improve health literacy. You can find reliable, current, easy-to-understand information at www.healthfinder.gov.
Get organized during Organize Your Medical Information Month
If you had a medical emergency, would your loved ones know where to find your medical information? Would responders know who to contact? Would a doctor treating you have access to your medical history or information about current health conditions and medication?
Data show that organization of medical information can lead to fewer medical errors, shorter hospital stays and better outcomes. Here are some tips to help you get organized:
- Document important health information. Make lists of current physicians, medications, immunizations and insurance policies. Assemble your family history. Be sure to document diagnoses, hospitalizations and other important health details.
- Create a healthcare binder. Use it to organize and keep track of health and insurance information, all in one place.
- Identify an emergency contact. List this individual on all medical and legal documents. And consider storing their contact information on your mobile device.
- Make it legal. If you ever become unable to make your own healthcare decisions, two legal documents can help ensure your wishes are followed: a Living Will and Health Care Power of Attorney.
- Designate a place in your home for storing your healthcare binder and all related materials. Share the location with loved ones who may be involved in your care.
- Create a portable health record. Emergency responders are trained to look for important information about a patient, such as emergency contacts, allergies and health history. The most common places they look? Wallets if you’re not in your home, and the front of refrigerators if you are. Create a card with this information and keep copies accessible.
Start a conversation during Talk About Your Medicines Month
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 700,000 emergency department visits and 120,000 hospitalizations annually are linked to adverse drug events – health situations that are the result of medication.
Such events can be more common in older adults, who often take multiple medications to treat chronic illnesses. The American Medical Association found that nearly 40 percent of people 65 and older now use five or more medications.
Understanding and talking about your medications – both prescription and over-the-counter – can help prevent adverse drug events. Follow these tips:
- Share your medications list. Make sure your loved ones and healthcare providers have a copy of your list. This is especially important when you have multiple providers prescribing medications.
- Read the label. Be sure you understand the correct dosing and schedule, how to take the medicine, side effects and potential drug interactions, as well as the proper storage of all medications.
- Use a single pharmacy to fill prescriptions. This can help prevent dangerous drug interactions. And always be sure to check prescriptions before leaving the pharmacy to confirm they’re correct.
- Ask questions. Make sure you understand what you’re taking, when and how much, as well as the type of side effects you may experience. And ask about warning signs of adverse reaction to medication.
You can find more information to help with medication discussions from the National Council on Patient Information and Education.

255,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/enjoy-fresh-air-sunlight-12-springtime-activities-older-adults/,"After months of colder weather and gray skies in many parts of the country, springtime is a welcomed season. It can be especially refreshing for older adults who have spent the winter cooped-up indoors. Fresh air, warmth and sunshine can play an important role in renewing the spirit and enhancing quality of life.
The Benefits of Fresh Air and Sunshine
Exposure to sunlight and fresh air offers many health benefits – greater energy, reduced stress and improved sleep, to name a few. Fresh air cleans the lungs and helps bring more oxygen to the cells. This increased oxygen in the body translates to greater energy and mental clarity.
Spending time in the sun can give a boost of vitamin D through skin absorption – necessary for the brain, bones and muscle function. Sleep schedules can be better regulated by getting some sunlight each morning, which helps the body shut off the snooze-inducing chemical melatonin. And sunlight is thought to help ward off depression, because the “happy” chemical serotonin is higher in the brain during the time of year when days are longer.
12 Ways to Take Advantage of the Season
To help older adults welcome spring, we’ve compiled a dozen ideas for outdoor activities that can help rejuvenate mind, body and soul.
- Take a walk. Studies have shown that even 10 minutes of walking each day can help older adults maintain strength and agility. Many local parks and nature trails have options for people with varying levels of mobility. Or a simple stroll around the neighborhood to take in the scenery can be just the right change of pace.
- Visit a farmers market. There’s so much to see and sample at a farmer’s market, and the vibrant colors of the produce and smell of fresh flowers are appealing to the senses. Plus, you can take home some fresh veggies for a healthy meal. Check out the National Farmers Market Directory for a location near you.
- Partake in spring cleaning. A little spring cleaning can create a healthy and comfortable living environment. Open the windows and let the fresh air in! It’s also a perfect opportunity to go through keepsakes and revisit special memories.
- Go fishing. Dust off your rod and reel and head to your favorite fishing spot. Whether you fish for pure enjoyment and simply “catch-and-release,” or try to reel in some keepers for dinner, fishing is an enjoyable, relaxing pastime.
- Visit tourist attractions. Be a tourist in your own town! Spring offers the perfect weather for traveling to local landmarks, historical sites and museums. Check with your local visitor center to see what’s happening in your town, and be sure to take advantage of senior discounts.
- Go on a picnic. A little creativity can turn even the most routine activities into adventures. Try turning your next meal into a picnic. Grab a blanket and head to your favorite park. Bring a book to read or, better yet, bring a friend and share a meal together in the fresh air.
- Eat outdoors at your favorite restaurant. If a picnic in the park doesn’t appeal to you, how about dinner at a nice restaurant that offers outdoor seating? You’ll get all the perks of dining al fresco, with none of the cooking or cleanup. Add good company, delicious food and ambiance, and you’ve got the recipe for a lovely night out.
- Install a bird feeder. Once the birds start chirping, you know spring has arrived. An abundant food source will help attract these feathered friends to your yard. Buy a bird feeder (or if you’re handy, build one) and install it near a window.
- Plant a garden: If you like to get your hands dirty, consider planting a garden. Spring is the right time to start cultivating the earth for herbs, vegetables and flowers. Aside from being able to reap what you sow, gardening is a great form of exercise and can reduce stress.
- Feel like a kid again: Head outside and do the activities you used to love as a kid! Fly a kite, search for four-leaf clovers or blow bubbles. These are great activities to do with your grandchildren, so invite them over for a playdate and some fun in the sun!
- Enjoy a sporting event. Whether it’s catching a Major League Baseball game or a grandchild’s soccer match, a sporting event can energize anyone. Attending a game also means time to socialize, which is great for older adults whose social calendars have been limited by ice and snow.
- Get some exercise. Staying physically active can boost your energy levels, help you maintain your independence and even combat symptoms of illnesses. Exercise doesn’t have to be strenuous; low-impact activities like walking, yoga, swimming and water aerobics can help with flexibility, balance and strength. The National Institute on Aging offers a guide that can help you get started.

256,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/essential-exercises-for-seniors/,"For seniors, physical activity is essential. A regular exercise routine can help to boost your energy, relieve stress and manage symptoms of illness and pain. Being inactive can be extremely risky, making it hard to do even the simplest task. Your exercise doesn’t have to be a hassle—you don’t need to join a gym or buy any special equipment, everything you need to exercise can be found around the house.
There are four main areas of exercise that seniors should focus on to stay healthy:
1. Cardio and Endurance For seniors, the best cardio and endurance exercises are swimming, walking and cycling. These activities are relatively low-impact, but still provide the opportunity to get your heart rate up, making your heart stronger and decreasing your risk of heart disease. If you would like access to exercise machines, look in to senior fitness centers in your community.
2. Strength and Resistance There’s no need for seniors to go out and buy weights to work on their strength. Just use household items like a gallon of milk (about 10 lbs.), a large bottle of water (about 2 lbs.) or even a bag of dry beans (about 1 lb.). It’s not about lifting heavy weights—it’s about keeping your joints moving!
3. Stretching and Flexibility Seniors should make it a point to stretch before and after any sort of physical activity. Not only does it relieve muscle tension, but it also helps to eliminate the possibility of developing muscle cramps. Stretching can also be done with household items, like a towel. Using a towel to stretch allows you to get a full stretch without causing discomfort. Your stretch should consist of nice, easy movements.
4. Balance Each year, approximately 2.3 million older Americans fall. Some great exercises to prevent your risk of falling include standing on one foot, walking heel to toe and leg raises. Also, strengthening your core will help you to maintain your balance.
One of the easiest times to exercise is while you are watching TV. Exercise during the commercials in your favorite show. This allows you to catch your breath between exercises and makes exercising fun!
Remember, it is important to listen to your body while exercising. If you begin to feel any discomfort, stop exercising. Don’t push it. Before starting any type of exercise routine, seniors should consult with their doctor.

257,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/exercise-and-aging/,"Exercise is important. Regardless of your age, getting out and getting exercise into your daily regime will help you live a healthier life. There are many benefits for elderly people to exercise. Here are a few of our favorites:
Manage Stress and Improve Mood: Regular, moderate physical activity can help manage stress and improve your mood. And, being active on a regular basis may help reduce feelings of depression. Studies also suggest that exercise can improve or maintain some aspects of cognitive function, such as your ability to shift quickly between tasks, plan an activity, and ignore irrelevant information.
Prevent or Delay Disease: Scientists have found that staying physically active and exercising regularly can help prevent or delay many diseases and disabilities. In some cases, exercise is an effective treatment for many chronic conditions. For example, studies show that people with arthritis, heart disease, or diabetes benefit from regular exercise. Exercise also helps people with high blood pressure, balance problems, or difficulty walking.
Exercise improves your sleep. Poor sleep is not an inevitable consequence of aging and quality sleep is important for your overall health. Exercise often improves sleep, helping you fall asleep more quickly and sleep more deeply.
Strength Training Can Prevent Age-Related Functional Impairment: Aging is linked to a decline is muscle mass, which can contribute to problems in motor movements Seniors who add intensive resistance training have been shown to increase gait speed and overall physical performance (aging.com 2014)
Exercising helps you keep on your toes…and on your feet: Exercise is a key to remaining steady on your feet as you get older, which is of incredible importance because not only are falls responsible for most fractures and traumatic brain injuries among the elderly, but those who fall can also develop an intense fear of falling again, which leads them to limit their activities and in turn increases their risk of falling even more.
Exercise helps older adults maintain or lose weight. As metabolism naturally slows with age, maintaining a healthy weight is a challenge. Exercise helps increase metabolism and builds muscle mass, helping to burn more calories. When your body reaches a healthy weight, your overall wellness will improve.
You are never too old to start exercising,.but before you start, make sure you check with your doctor and work together to find the right exercising plan to fit your needs. Get a medical clearance, start slow, commit to a realistic exercise schedule and stay motivated by focusing on short-term goals."
258,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/eye-care-for-aging-eyes/,"A look at some common age-related eye health problems and several healthy eye care tips that can help protect your vision as you age.
Changes in vision can occur in your later years. As you reach the age of 60 and beyond, you can develop eye diseases and age-related eye health problems that could lead to vision loss. Sometimes these diseases present no symptoms and you may not even realize that you are experiencing changes in your vision until it’s too late.
By getting regular eye exams and maintaining healthy habits for aging eyes, you have a better chance of not only detecting certain eye diseases early on but you’ll also help safeguard your vision as you age.
Age-related eye problems
There are several common age-related eye problems to be mindful of:
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), an eye disease that affects the macula – the center of the light-sensitive retina at the back of the eye which allows us to see fine detail and colors. AMD can cause central vision loss, so activities like reading, driving, watching TV and recognizing faces can all be affected. However, with macular degeneration, peripheral vision remains unaffected.
Cataracts are cloudy areas in the typically clear lens of the eye. Depending on their size and location, they can affect normal vision. Most age-related cataracts develop gradually, so you may not notice changes in your vision in the early stages of this disease.
Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases characterized by damage to the optic nerve. Individuals with a family history of glaucoma, African Americans and older adults have a greater risk of developing the disease. Glaucoma is often painless with no symptoms, but it can eventually result in vision loss. It is the leading cause of irreversible blindness.
Diabetic retinopathy is a retinal disorder that occurs in people with diabetes. It is due to gradual damage to the tiny blood vessels that sustain the retina. These damaged blood vessels leak blood and other fluids that cause retinal tissue to swell and cloud vision. In some cases, this condition can cause blindness.
Retinal detachment is a separation of the retina from the underlying tissue. It usually occurs unexpectedly due to changes in the fluid that fills the back of the eye. Other causes include trauma to the eye or head, health problems like advanced diabetes, and inflammatory eye disorders. If not treated right away, it can cause permanent loss of vision.
Dry eye is a less severe but often chronic condition in which the eyes produce too few tears. Tears are vital because they help keep the front surface of the eye healthy and they provide clear vision. Dry eye is common in older adults.
5 Healthy Habits
The following habits aren’t just for aging eyes. No matter how old you are, there are several lifestyle choices you can make to maintain healthy eyes.
Shield eyes from UV rays. Always wear sunglasses with the best UV protection no matter what the season. A hat that shields your eyes from the sun can provide additional protection.
Think nutrition. Your diet can affect your overall eye health. Good nutrition includes leafy greens, whole grains, nuts, fruits, vegetables…and lots of water. Also, remember to keep sugar intake in check.
Don’t smoke. Smoking significantly increases your risk of developing disorders like cataracts and age-related macular degeneration. It also can increase your chance of developing optical nerve damage.
Get enough sleep. One of the easiest ways to maintain eye health is by getting enough ZZZs. A healthy sleep routine not only contributes to general well-being, but it also helps keep your eyes from straining.
Get regular eye exams. Preventative eye care is critical for detecting problems early. Adults over the age of 40 should get annual eye exams to help identify age-related eye diseases such as macular degeneration or glaucoma.
It’s never too early to start protecting your eyes. Healthy eye care habits and regular exams can help maintain good eye health now and as you age.
If you are a family caregiver and need assistance with your aging senior, such as getting them to and from their eye check-ups, FirstLight offers a number of Senior Care Services.

259,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/eye-health-protecting-your-parents-vision/,"In honor of Glaucoma Awareness Month, we went through our blog library and found a few of our most popular posts related to eye health.
January is Glaucoma Awareness Month, an important time to raise awareness of this growing disease, as well as other eye health problems. If you are caring for an aging parent or other loved one, it’s important that they get an eye exam every year, especially if they are over the age of 65. These exams are even more critical if they have high blood pressure, diabetes or a family history of eye disease.
Many eye diseases have no physical symptoms. Therefore, regular eye examinations can help detect issues early on, which can protect your parent’s vision as they age.
The Leading Cause of Irreversible Blindness
Glaucoma is a disease that damages the eye’s optic nerve. It typically happens when fluid builds up in the front part of the eye. That extra fluid increases eye pressure, damaging the optic nerve. It also can result in partial to complete loss of vision. Here are some symptoms of glaucoma to be aware of, as well as treatment options and prevention.
Age-Related Eye Health Problems
Changes in vision can occur in the later years of life. The risk of developing eye diseases and age-related eye health problems that lead to vision loss can increase after the age of 65. Ensuring your parents get regular eye exams and maintain healthy habits gives you a better chance of detecting certain eye diseases before it’s too late. Here is a look at some common age-related eye health problems and several healthy eye care tips that can help protect their vision as they age.
Regular Eye Exams Are Key
January is a great time to schedule an annual eye exam. If your parents have not had their eyes checked in years, perhaps these reasons can help convince them how important it is.
We understand how demanding family caregiving can be. We help so many people who are caring for an aging parent while also working a full-time job and taking care of their own children. FirstLight can provide companion care services to help get your loved one to their eye doctor appointment, sit with them during the exam and make sure they follow any care plans provided by their healthcare professional.

260,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/fall-prevention-for-seniors/,"Falling is an all too common problem with seniors that often lead to injuries and future health complications (due to a decline in bone mass throughout aging, falls can be the first step to decreasing health.) In fact, the majority of accidents that occur in retirement facilities are falls. The bright side is that falls can be easily prevented since they usually are caused by simple mistakes. In order to help avoid future health complications and maintain independence, our team of caregivers at FirstLight Home Care have developed some tips to prevent falls for seniors.
Keep a Well Lit Living Area
A well lit home is one of the easiest and most effective solutions to preventing falls. Make sure the home is bright enough to illuminate possible tripping hazards like electrical cords, throw rugs, and slippery, wet floors. Properly lit rooms will help eliminate falls that can be easily avoided and will create a safer environment to walk in.
Wear the Right Shoes
Another easy solution to preventing falls is wearing the right shoes. Avoid slippers or any shoes without good traction. Non-slip, sturdy shoes will help seniors maintain traction and balance in situations where they might fall. Also be sure to avoid shoes with thick soles since they can be more difficult to walk and balance in. By wearing thinner soled shoes, seniors will also be able to feel what is beneath them and better react to hazardous situations.
Remove Unnecessary Home Hazards
Homes are filled with tripping hazards. Even the most agile of people will find a way to trip on one thing or another throughout their homes. For seniors, this is all the more so. Make sure the home is cleared of any unnecessary tripping hazards, including wires and cords, throw rugs, and uneven floors.
Use Assistive Devices
There are tons of great assistive devices that can help aid seniors in their homes, including handrails, shower seats, and not-slip stairs. Each of these devices help improve a senior’s balance in situations where they might fall and help maintain their independence. Find areas throughout the home that are problematic and consider devices that will help maintain balance and prevent falls.
However, not all assistive devices are good. One item to avoid is bed guard rails. Guard rails do more harm than good since they can cause serious injury. In fact, most hospitals and retirement facilities prohibit restraints for this very reason. Instead, consider an electric bed and position it in its lowest horizontal position during times of rest to avoid further injuries if falls do occur. Electric beds are great for individuals that are in high-risk of falling because they can aid in entering and exiting the bed, as well as in maintaining a lower position while sleeping. You can also place a cushioned mat alongside the bed to soften the floor around them.
Stay Active
A healthy, active body is better equipped to avoid tripping hazards throughout the home as well as to recover from near-fall experiences. Seniors should keep an active lifestyle, at least walking each day to keep limber. Make sure to consult a doctor when beginning any form of exercise to ensure that the proper safety precautions are being used.
Rearrange sleeping quarters
The bedroom is a high-use room that often isn’t in the most ideal location in a home for a senior. If a senior’s bedroom is on the second floor of their home, consider moving it to the main floor. This will not only decrease the possibility of falling on stairs, but it will also limit the need for unnecessary travel throughout the house. This will also help maintain independence since they will not require as much aid before and after rest.
Consult a Physician About Medications
Some medications can cause dizziness, lack of vision, and weakness. Make sure to consult a doctor to know the risks that certain medications pose and to take the necessary precautions throughout the home to prevent falling. By discussing these factors with a doctor, seniors will be better prepared for preventing falls throughout their home."
261,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/fall-signals-time-for-seniors-to-stay-active/,"Now that the temperatures are cooling, there has never been a more optimal time to get outdoors and get active! And with the heat of summer a near memory, we encourage the elderly to enjoy the less humid temperatures. How can you help them make the most of the fresh air while it lasts? Consider these helpful tips to better keep your loved one active, alive and invigorated by fall’s cool rush:
First Things First: Before starting an exercise program, consult a doctor. This is especially important when working with an in-home care provider service, such as FirstLight Home Care. If you suspect that an elderly individual you are working with has limitations, make sure he or she consults a doctor before engaging in any routine that includes an extended amount of physical activity.
Play Seasonal Games: With football season upon us, outdoor recreational games are getting big play. Consider involving your loved one in seasonal traditions, such as a bean bag toss game (also commonly called, “bags”). The total point values are gained in three tosses. Bean bags is an easy game that provides companionship, interactivity and above all else: Low impact physical activity.
Walk it Out: Establishing a walking routine this fall is a fine way to not only stay active but also view the trees’ beautiful color changes. As a caregiver, you can serve as a regular “walking buddy.” Try using a pedometer to help track steps—it can also serve as an excellent motivator for your loved one. Keep track of your walks via a calendar. Also, consider scheduling the walk at the same time each day to ensure a more stable routine.
Great Big Bake-offs: Nothing says fall more than homemade apple pie—and sometimes, a pie can taste better when the apples come straight from the trees. Organizing an apple picking outing at a local orchard is a fine way for a senior citizen to enjoy the true essence of the season. Then, spend some time together baking while the smell of fresh apples fills the home. What better way to usher in the year’s shortest, sweetest season?

One who takes care of a member of his or her family, often a senior parent or disabled relative; someone who is responsible for attending to the daily needs of another person.
According to an AAPR Public Policy Institute study, the average U.S. family caregiver is a 49-year-old woman who provides unpaid care of nearly 20 hours per week to her mother for nearly five years.
The life of working family caregivers can be difficult. Caring for a loved one while also working a paying job is time-consuming and it’s physically and emotionally demanding. The many challenges and distractions of caregiving also can reduce worker productivity and oftentimes impact one’s health. All of this can impact employers.
- More than 40 million American workers are caring for loved ones over the age of 65.
- Six in 10 are balancing these caregiving responsibilities with full- or part-time jobs.
Home care services can be a valuable solution. Hiring a professional caregiver can allow family caregivers to retain their paying job and remain productive while on the job. Obviously, this also helps employers because it can reduce the chance of an employee missing work, and it can help ensure employees maintain good mental and physical health.
According to the Home Care Association of America, there are several ways in which the many senior care responsibilities of family caregivers can impact worker productivity and increase costs for employers.
Work suffers. More than 60 percent of family caregivers report making work accommodations due to family caregiving responsibilities, including taking a leave of absence, arriving late, passing up a promotion or retiring early.
Health suffers. Less than 50 percent of family caregivers report being in very good health, while one in five feel their health has gotten worse because of caregiving. Among caregivers that provide more than 21 hours of care per week, 46 percent report high emotional stress. This can result in increased health care costs for employers. Employees who are family caregivers drive up employers’ health care costs by 8 percent on average, potentially costing U.S. businesses more than $13 billion.
Productivity falls off and employers pay. In a recent study, 25 percent of working family caregivers reported missing an average of 6.1 hours of work the previous week due to caregiving responsibilities. Estimated productivity loss while at work due to caregiving responsibilities surpassed 18 percent. Costs associated with caregiving – including the need to replace employees, absenteeism, workday distractions and reductions in hours – all impact employers.
Hiring professional home care can help.

265,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/family-caregivers-need-vacations/,"We talk about it all the time – the tremendous responsibilities that fall on family caregivers. Caring for an elderly parent can be emotionally and physically draining. And for primary caregivers, it is often a 24/7, 365-day-a-year job. Taking any kind of break – let alone a planned vacation – seems impossible. Then when you begin to think about all the planning and preparation that is involved, you wonder if it’s even worth doing.
The thought of taking time off from your caregiving duties also brings much worry. What if Mom falls? What if she forgets to take her medication? What if she needs to get to important doctor appointments?
These are all valid questions and concerns. However, family caregivers need vacations too. It is essential that you take some time off to rejuvenate and re-energize yourself, as well as attempt to avert caregiver burnout, stress, and even poor health.
With advanced preparation, family caregivers can take vacations too!
Plan ahead. Make your plans in advance, even if you are just going away for a long weekend. Give your elderly parent ample notice that you will be gone and for how long. You don’t want to surprise them.
Determine what kind of assistance your parent will need and who will help while you’re away. If your parent is somewhat independent and doesn’t require constant care, you might only need someone to check in on them during the day, prepare a few meals or provide transportation. A sibling, friend or neighbor might be able to step in and manage this while you’re gone.
If your parent needs more care and can’t be alone overnight, ask a relative – or several family members who can share the responsibilities – to stay with them overnight.
Consider in-home care. Depending on what kind of care your parent needs, paid caregivers can assist with activities of daily living, such as bathing, dressing, mobility, meal preparation, light housekeeping or transportation. They are trained to provide constant quality care in a variety of situations.
In addition to Companion Care and Personal Care services, FirstLight also offers 24-hour home care by providing a selection of personal emergency response system (PERS) devices along with our secure, Web-based care monitoring tool called Client Care Access. Our in-home caregivers are available at any hour, and together with our technology, we provide round-the-clock peace of mind to clients and their families.
If you plan to hire a caregiver, be sure that he or she is a good match for your parent and his or her needs. Spend time allowing your loved one and the caregiver to get to know each other and become comfortable with one another. At FIrstLight, we know that we are caring for families in sometimes challenging situations. Our respite care services can offer much-needed time off.
Organize important information. Compile all important information into one folder or binder so that the person who is providing care has everything they need while you are away. This should include:
- All possible emergency contacts
- A list of your parent’s health care providers, including phone numbers and addresses
- Your parent’s preferred hospital and their pharmacy
- Their medical, dental and vision insurance cards
- A list of all medications and the schedule in which they are to be taken.
- Important documents, including power of attorney, living will, advance directives, and Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders.
Let go of the guilt. It’s natural to feel guilty about taking respite, and it’s normal to think that no one else could take care of your parent the way you can. Additionally, your loved one might not like the idea of you taking a vacation at all, which can make it even harder for you to get away.
But family caregivers need vacations. Taking a break from caregiving duties is a necessity, especially for your own health and well-being. And, getting the right help can provide the peace of mind you need. For winter vacation inspiration, check out this list of Best Places to Visit in January.

266,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/family-caregivers-respite-care/,"Caring for a parent, family members or loved one day in and day out can take its toll on the caregiver. It’s a tough job and sometimes caregivers need a sanity break and take time for themselves and to rejuvenate their own body, mind and soul.
At FirstLight Home Care, we are caregivers and we know what caregivers go through. We support these family members and over the years we have found these 4 tips to be very helpful in keeping your sanity in check.
1. Have a Life: Yes caregiving can be a 24/7 job but you need to set time aside each month for you. Go to lunch with friends, attend a community event, get a massage, go for daily walks – do something. This will break up your day or week and allow you time to step away from your responsibilities and come back with a new outlook on your daily tasks.
2. Set goals: Goal setting is very important. Find something you want to achieve and set a goal to reach it. Learn a new language, take an art class, or learn how to sew are just a few examples. Make the goal something you’d enjoy achieving and set a realistic timeline to achieve it. Create milestones and celebrate each one that are achieved. Identifying a goal and working through the process of achieving the goal will be mentally stimulating.
3. Build your support system: Grow your network. Reach out to family, friends and others that are in the same situation as you. Join support groups (whether in person or online) so that you can share situations and get advice from others who know what you’re going through. Call on your family to help. Ask siblings and extended family for support so that you can take an afternoon (or even a weekend) off to get personal things done, to rest and take the break you deserve.
4. Take a break: No one can work 24/7. You need a break. You need to get your mind off care giving to help you keep going with your care. This is where FirstLightHomeCare can help. We offer respite care services so that you can take a break and know that your loved one you are caring for is in good, professional and caring hands. For more information on FirstLight Home Care, click here.
Remember that being a caregiver is something we are, not something we do. It can be overwhelming and all-consuming so taking a break is good for you. It may be hard for you to do, but you need to do activities outside of caring for someone else so that you can nurture yourself too."
267,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/family-caregivers-should-practice-self-care/,"The COVID-19 pandemic has made caring for a loved one even more difficult. Family members caring for a loved one in their home are faced with so many more concerns during this time. But family caregivers should practice self-care.
Simple tasks like shopping for groceries or picking up medication have an added layer of complication and worry. Senior isolation may be a concern. Even making sure your loved one is getting proper nutrition and enough sleep can be a challenge.
Some family caregivers may be without respite care or the help of other family members, making the task of self-care more difficult than it already was. But we know how important it is for family caregivers to practice self-care, especially during a pandemic.

268,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/family-caregiving-101/,"Our Nurse Gina receives a lot of questions from families that recently started caring for aging family members. Their questions and concerns tend to focus on the best tools they can apply to their situation to help ease the role of caregiver. Here are some of our answers.
Ask Questions: To give your loved one the best care, you have to understand her needs. Set aside time to talk. Find out how she feels and what she wants you to do for her.
Don’t argue or insist your own opinion is best. Offer ideas, but listen to what she has to say. Show that you’ve heard by repeating back key points, like, “I understand that you want to do more for yourself.”
Create a Schedule: When you care for someone at home, days can feel long and unfocused. Give the person you’re caring for structure by making a schedule. Set times for meals, personal care, household chores, exercise, activities, and relaxation. Also set sleep and wake times to make sure both of you get enough rest.
When you make the schedule, think about your loved one’s needs. Consider how she organizes her day before you got involved.
Get Organized: Paperwork can pile up. To keep things running smoothly, put prescriptions, insurance info, doctor contacts, and health history in one place, like a multi-pocket folder. Keep track of appointments in a paper, computer, or smartphone calendar.
Set an alarm to remind you twice: a day or two, and a few hours ahead of time. Add your own appointments to the calendar to avoid schedule conflicts, and plan for days when you won’t be around to help.
Keep Track of Medicines: More than a third of older adults take five or more drugs to treat different conditions. All those meds can lead to mix-ups and mistakes. Go over the list with your loved one’s doctor and pharmacist to make sure every medication and dose is correct.
Store all medicines in one place for easy access. Use a pillbox to keep organized by day and time. Do an inventory every few months, and throw out any expired pills.
Simplify Meals: It takes time to prepare three meals a day. Planning ahead can help. Do all the week’s grocery shopping in one trip. Cook a big batch of meals and freeze them. Ask friends and family members to chip in. Set up a rotating schedule where each person shops for groceries, or brings over a whole cooked meal. When you cook, adapt dishes to your loved one’s taste as well as calorie and dietary needs, like low salt or extra B vitamins.
Make the Home Safe: We talk about this all the time. To avoid falls and injuries, there a few changes around the house that you can make to help your aging parents. Install grab bars and handrails in the bathroom to help prevent shower and tub slips. Add lights along hallways and stairways to lighten nighttime bathroom trips. Secure rugs with tape and pick up clutter. Store often-used items within reach so your loved one doesn’t have to stretch or climb. Buy a fall monitor to alert you, and call 911 if she does take a spill.
Recruit a Team: If you can’t handle all the care on your own, put together an on-call group of family members and friends who can step in and help. Give each person one or more tasks. They can help prepare meals or run errands. You can also hire someone to cook, clean, or handle daily personal and medical tasks, like helping your loved one dress, bathe, and take medicine. Your local agency on aging can help you find the right helper for each type of task. Utilize local companies, like FirstLight Home Care. They can lend you the necessary support you need for day-to-day care.
Encourage Self-Care: Help keep your loved one’s age, illness, or disability from taking a toll on her self-esteem. You can restore her feeling of control by letting her take as active a part as possible in her own care. Encourage her to make decisions and do tasks she can manage — like dressing or using the toilet. Let her help choose and plan activities. It will give her a sense of purpose, and make your job easier.

269,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/family-discussion-long-distance-caregiving/,"Caregiving from a distance is no easy task. It can be stressful because you can’t be there at a moment’s notice when your parents need you. To help reduce some of the stress and to help you organize the process for care when your loved ones do not live near you, we have put together some helpful tips we’ve gathered from Nurse Gina.
Create a Contact List: Assemble and organize a contact list that includes addresses, phone numbers and emails of friends, neighbors, doctors, faith leaders and others in regular contact with your parents who you can be reached in the event of an emergency. Next time you are in town visiting your folks, make a point to introduce yourself to those on the contact list so that you feel more comfortable reaching out to them. In fact, take them out for dinner as a way to get to know them and say thanks for watching over your parents.
This list should also include other pertinent contact information, such as your parent’s local pharmacy, senior center, senior transportation services, and other businesses that you may need support from.
Gather and Copy Important Documents: Collect and make a copy of important medical, insurance, legal, financial, and even utilities’ documents and contact information and have them in an easy to reach place in case of an unexpected illness or accident. Having important documents in one place will simplify everything.
Productive Family Visits: Next time you are in town, you should spend time assessing their changing needs. In advance, schedule any necessary appointments your parents may need so that you can be there to discuss any changes with their doctor. Walk around their home to make sure things are in order and that their living environment is safe. Evaluate how they’re doing – are they keeping up with housekeeping, are they eating properly, paying bills and balancing their bank accounts, and socializing? You may find out during your visit that they may need more help to keep their independence at home.
Gather Local Information: You may find they need additional support in the months ahead. Identify community organizations that can work with you from afar and you could call when necessary. These local organizations may want to see you in advance. Your trip to visit your parents would be a great opportunity to make the connection, prepare the necessary documents and questions that you would like to have answered.
Get Help with Managing the Care: Most communities have professionals, like FirstLight Home Care, that can work alongside you to gauge your loved one’s abilities and needs and set up a plan for care. These organizations can be a great asset for your parent who may need day-to-day or occasional care. To learn more about the local services our FirstLight Home Care offices offer, check out our services.
Living far away from your parents is something many adult children face. By getting organized now, you will be prepared in case of an emergency and help you to reduce your stress. You need peace of mind in knowing how they are doing. If you have more questions or concerns about caring for your loved ones from afar, you can always ask our Nurse Gina. She is a great resource that is just a click away.

271,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/family-traveling-with-your-aging-parents/,"Summer travel is in full swing. If you are like any families across the United States, your traveling and your trip mate might include traveling with a senior. They may not be as mobile without a wheelchair, or they may have a specific health condition such as Alzheimer’s disease or heart problems that may require you take the lead, not only as the tour guide, but as the caregiver. This may make your vacation much more complex, regardless of whether you’re traveling by plane, cruise ship or your own family car.
We spoke with Nurse Gina and she put together some travel tips that she recommends from our Travel Companion Program that will help make the most out of your next family trip.
Before you head out, consult with your parent’s primary care doctor for travel approval. Our loved one needs to be cleared for travel by his or her primary care doctor, especially if you’re accommodating a health condition such as Alzheimer’s disease. Make sure the chosen destination is appropriate to your parent’s limitations, and ask the doctor for specific travel tips as well as any necessary vaccinations or extra medications.
Arrange Special Services Ahead of Time: If your loved one needs a wheelchair at the airport, advance boarding of the airplane or train, or special seating in a disabled row or near a restroom, get in touch with the airline personnel or travel company to make sure these are available upon arrival. Remember the TSA security checkpoints, too: be aware of any surgical implants that might set off metal detectors, and wear easy-to-remove shoes. Contact the airline in advance to arrange for special screening if your loved one has disabilities or special needs, and contact hotels to check on things like shower bars and handicapped accessible rooms.
Research Medical Facilities at Your Destination: Make sure you know where the nearest hospitals and care centers are, in case of emergency. Bring contact details for your own doctors, too, and any necessary insurance information.
Organize All Necessary Documentation and Identification: Have your travel documentation in order: passports, if needed, as well as driver’s license, travel tickets and itineraries—and make multiple copies. Pack medical documentation: Medicare and insurance cards (and photocopies) should be in your carry on (not checked baggage) as well as any prescriptions or physician’s statements.
Make It Easy To Keep In Contact: Provide your loved one with a calling card or a prepaid cell phone, if they don’t already have one. This is an ideal way to make sure they can get in touch with you at all times. Program all important phone numbers into the cell phone ahead of time.
Pack Essentials in a Travel Bag that is Easily Accessible: Keep the essentials close at hand: an ample supply of necessary medication, important documents and phone numbers, favorite snacks or drinks, a deck of cards or other entertainment, a light sweater, a hat, sunscreen and a travel pillow. These should be kept in a carry-on bag, or a tote that’s readily available inside the car rather than locked away in the trunk.
Pack Light: As the caregiver, less is more. By traveling light you will have less to juggle and can give more attention and focus on your loved one. After all, you don’t want to throw your back out, particularly when someone is depending on you!
Plan for Breaks and Downtime in the Schedule: There’s nothing less relaxing during a vacation than having to rush from place to place, and quiet time is even more important if you’re a caregiver to your travel mate.

272,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/family-volunteering-the-best-gift-of-all/,"This weekend, many families will have the rare opportunity to gather together to celebrate the holidays and wrap-up another great year. The challenge is finding activities that the whole family can enjoy. While you are looking for ways to spend time together, including activities kids and seniors alike will be able to participate in, consider volunteering a little of your time to a less fortunate family or local community organization.
No matter where you will be spending your holiday, there are many ways to volunteer. What better gift during the holiday season for someone less fortunate then a little of your time and holiday cheer? Here are some ideas that your whole family can participate in:
• Adopt a family. Many individuals are either unable to visit family members or have no one to spend the holidays with. Local churches and schools offer programs that allow families to support these people. Your help could provide them with a meal, gifts or even holiday decorations to brighten their season. Your kids might enjoy picking out gifts for a family with young children while your senior family members might find joy in preparing a meal.
• Collect children’s supplies for local hospitals and children’s centers. This could include school supplies, coloring books, craft ideas or toys. Picking out these items would be fun for the entire family and you know after dropping them off that many children will find joy in even the smallest donation.
• Spread some cheer in your own neighborhood! You never know how many of your closest neighbors may need assistance or even a thoughtful gesture around the holidays. Consider making some holiday cookies for the people on your street or delivering handmade holiday cards.
There are many ways to volunteer with your family this weekend. Whether it is visiting a local shelter or community center and finding out ways to help a neighbor in need, even the smallest donations of time or goods can brighten someone’s day and share the holiday spirit with your family.

275,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/feeling-old/,"Without a doubt, our society is obsessed with being younger. More than $114 billion will be spent on anti-aging products by 2015. We’re always after the “fountain of youth”, a way to turn back the clock and eradicate the wrinkles on our face and maintain our youthful vigor.
I remember when I was young and my Mom was 50. I thought that was ancient! Now that I am in my 50s, even 80 seems young. Your perspective totally changes. When my kids call me an “old lady”, I am offended by the reference.
Wonder why our aging parents are always talking about their health and aching joints? Too often we push aside their complaints without offering much sympathy. However, we really don’t realize what they are going through.
That’s why I find this story so fascinating. Amy Patel, a 50-year-old from the United Kingdom was given an “aging suit” that added 30 – 40 years to the way she felt. Both of her parents are in their 80s and she wanted to emulate their experience.
A Glimpse into the Future
The concept was developed by the dementia unit at the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust to help those who care for the elderly to better understand their patients’ needs and fears. Patel wore dark glasses to mimic cataracts, leaving her with tunnel vision and blurred peripheral sight. She wore ear defenders to simulate hearing loss, a neck brace to limit her mobility and a weighted vest that made her stoop. Additionally, weights were strapped on to her feet to imitate arthritis and vibrating gloves reproduced the feelings of Parkinson’s.
The result was not pretty, but realistic.
Patel couldn’t see, bend down, hear or hardly move. As she described it, it took ten minutes to transform her from a vibrant 5 feet 7 inch tall woman into a “bowed down old lady, my back aching, unable to do more than shuffle along with the aid of a walking stick.” She felt isolated confused, and frightened. As she said, small tasks like making coffee or a meal became a major project.
And the worse part? Not only did the aging suit change her physically, but mentally as well. Her loneliness, embarrassment and feelings of defenselessness left her depressed. After only an hour and a half in the suit, she was physically and emotionally drained.
And she wasn’t the only one. A physically fit 19-year-old rugby player who tried on the suit couldn’t even walk 100 yards in it.
Be Compassionate To The Elderly
So if your parents have problems getting in and out of the car, maneuvering stairs or forgetfulness, it’s important to be compassionate not critical. Don’t hurry them. Under the circumstances, they are probably going as fast as they can.
Don’t honk at elderly drivers. Chances are, they probably shouldn’t be driving, but they don’t want to give up their independence. Hold the door open for the elderly if they are walking into a building. Gently repeat things of they can’t hear you well and don’t get annoyed at them. Have you ever tried hearing aids yourself? It’s not as easy as you think – sometimes, they make it harder to hear! If they have good hearing in one ear, always try and talk toward that side.
At FirstLight Home Care, we don’t need to be reminded to be kind to the elderly, because it’s both our job and our passion. We take care of aging parents and loved ones who may be temporarily or permanently have a hard time taking care of themselves. We respect our client’s physical and mental limitations and have developed a dementia care plan that keeps the elderly safe and active.
As Patel concludes: “I have walked in the shoes of the elderly and infirm, and it was the most disconcerting, humbling experience I’ve ever had. Walk a mile in someone else’s shoes before you judge them.”
If you know a loved one who needs help with dementia or the activities of daily living, contact FirstLight Home Care today.

276,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/fight-kidney-disease-with-these-tips/,"Kidney disease affects around 37 million people in the U.S., or 15% of the adult population. However, most people who have it don’t even know it. In fact, the National Kidney Foundation estimates that only 10% of those with chronic kidney disease are diagnosed. Left unchecked, it can cause serious health problems.
As we enter National Kidney Month, it’s a good time to learn about what the condition is and ways to prevent it.
What is Kidney Disease?
People are born with two kidneys on either side of their spine. These organs act as filters, getting rid of waste and toxic substances, such as medications or chemicals, in the body. They also return essentials, like vitamins, glucose, hormones and amino acids, back to the bloodstream, maintaining a healthy balance of water and minerals.
Kidney disease affects how these organs function and diminishes their ability to cleanse the blood and filter out extra water. This, in turn, can cause issues like erratic blood pressure, anemia and a build up of wastes and fluids in the body. It can also lead to other health problems, including weak bones, nerve damage and malnutrition.
Kidney disease can be caused by a number of factors. Those with diabetes, high blood pressure and other chronic conditions, such as auto-immune disorders like lupus, are at a higher risk for it. Traumatic injuries with blood loss, long-term dehydration, birth defects and long-term use of certain medications can impact the kidneys as well.
If kidney disease goes undetected, the organs may stop working completely. As a result, dialysis is eventually required to help the kidneys function properly. While dialysis can’t cure the disease, it can prolong the life of the patient. If dialysis stops working, a kidney transplant is the next step.
What are the Signs of Kidney Disease?
Kidney disease progresses slowly over time. These organs are very adaptable and can often compensate when there’s a problem. However, as damage worsens, it slowly uncovers symptoms, such as:
- A change in urination, including pain and a shift to a darker color
- Swelling in the feet and ankles
- Nausea and vomiting
- A lack of appetite
- A general sense of fatigue and weakness
- Problems sleeping
- Persistent itching that won’t go away
- Muscle twitches or cramps
- Mental fogginess or trouble thinking
- Chest pains and / or shortness of breath
- High blood pressure that is difficult to control
Since many of these symptoms can also indicate other conditions, it’s important to speak to your doctor, or your loved one’s physician, if you have concerns.
Tips for Maintaining Kidney Health
If you or a loved one develops kidney disease, it’s critical to take steps to control the condition and limit the damage. Some ways to do that include:
- Be cautious about medications. Take all the prescribed medications recommended for lowering blood pressure and managing kidney disease. However, when it comes to over-the-counter medications, be cautious. Nonprescription pain relievers, like aspirin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen can cause damage to the kidneys if not taken properly. Talk to a doctor about managing pain and which medications are safe.
- Maintain a healthy weight. If you or your loved one are overweight or obsese, your kidneys are going to have to work harder to function. It’s why losing even just a few pounds can go a long way in helping to improve blood pressure and kidney health. Aim to increase physical activity and encourage your loved ones to do the same.
Nutrition is also a key component to maintaining kidney health with a diet consisting of vegetables, fruits, lean meats and other heart-healthy options. If you or your loved one requires more support, talk to a doctor or nutritionist about diet strategies that can specifically help with kidney disease.
- Quit smoking. Cigarettes will harm the kidneys and make any existing damage worse. If it’s a struggle to quit smoking, talk to a healthcare provider about different options for medications to help you stop. There are also many support groups and even counseling that can help to manage cravings.
- Sleep well. Kidney function is actually regulated by the sleep-wake cycle. In fact, people who sleep less usually have faster kidney function decline. Healthy sleep habits are especially important for those with kidney disease. Aim for around seven to eight hours each night.
- Keep stress in check. Stress and uncontrolled reactions to stress can also lead to kidney damage. It’s why healthy coping techniques are essential. These will look different for everyone. For some, it might be solitude and reading a book. For others, it might be spending time with friends playing a game. Just make sure to have fun, relaxing activities scheduled into your week.
If your elderly loved one needs help managing day-to-day activities, contact your local FirstLight® Home Care today. Our experienced caregivers are trained to support and care for seniors and other at-risk adults with a range of diseases, wherever they call home.

277,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/fighting-holiday-stress-a-caregivers-guide/,"We all know the feeling; the anxiety that creeps around in November and builds up as the year end approaches. If you’re a family caregiver, you know this stress all too well. Holiday parties, events, shopping and vacation planning are all top of mind for many people but for family caregivers, the added stress of making sure elderly friends and family are provided for can compound and intensify these feelings.
It’s a well known fact that caregiver stress, if not managed, takes a heavy toll on a person’s mental and physical health. Added to the stress that naturally arises around the holidays, and it’s a recipe for illness. At FirstLight, we know our caregivers’ health is just as important as the health and wellbeing of our clients. Here are a few tips from our caregivers on how they manage stress around the holidays.
• Figure out what is most important to you over the holidays and make time to do it. Is it trimming the tree? Planning parties with family and friends? Sending holiday greeting cards? Or maybe you prefer making gifts for loved ones or preparing special holiday treats. Whatever activities are most important to you are the ones you should make time to participate in. Doing something you love and find enjoyment from can help ease the stress. Here is an awesome chart from Caregiver.com that can help you assess what is most important to you.
• Give yourself a break. Take the opportunity to enjoy the festivities by having another family member or a professional caregiver help with care. FirstLight now offers gift certificates for caregiving services that can be used year-round and are perfect for getting a little respite care.
• Remember that your physical health is just as important as your mental state. Many busy caregivers run on coffee and unhealthy snacks to get them through a long day. Keep colds away by staying hydrated, washing your hands frequently and eating balanced meals throughout the day. If you haven’t gotten a flu shot yet, it’s never too late!
Most importantly, take a breath and remember that you’re not alone in your situation. To learn about support groups or find someone to talk to who understands, check out the Family Caregiver Alliance website to find a resource near you.
The team at FirstLight wishes you a safe and happy holiday season!"
278,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/fighting-off-the-flu/,"With flu season starting this weekend, doctors and health officials are reminding everyone to get the flu shot—especially seniors.
Some organizations are even offering free flu shots today. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, for example, will offer free flu shots for senior citizens on Medicare or enrolled in Medicare Advantage programs through Nov. 20. The shots will only cost $15 for others.
Luckily this season, a new high-dose flu shot is available for senior citizens. The vaccine contains Antigen, which produces a stronger immune response than the standard flu shot.
Seniors should also beware of H1N1. After last year’s pandemic, health workers say people need to be extra cautious this year, reported WJBF-TV today. Symptoms include temperatures as high as 104 degrees, severe body aches and a hacking cough."
279,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/finding-balance-tips-for-the-sandwiched-caregiver/,"The sandwich generation is a generation of people who care for their aging parents while bringing up their own children.
A recent Pew Study said that nearly 40 percent of those in the sandwich generation also provide emotional and financial support to both their aging parents, as well as their grown children.
The sandwich generation caregiver gets squeezed between caring for two different groups of family members, and it can get a bit stressful. Here are six practical tips for caregivers living in the sandwich generation.
Prioritize What Matters: Make a list of all the things you think must be done. Then prioritize them. What can you cut out? How can you minimize your workload each day? What support or personal care can you hire out?
Share the Load: You may be responsible to handle most of the caregiving duties, but that doesn’t mean you have to do everything yourself. Start delegating some of the duties that others in your family can do. Have your family help with chores around the house or at your parent’s home. Ask your siblings to help with your parents on certain days or on the weekends. If the family can’t help, then find outside resources, like the non-medical home cares services of FirstLight Home Care, to help you.
Take Care of Yourself: If you don’t take care of yourself, you won’t be able to properly take care of others. Plain and simple. It’s easy to put yourself last when every hour of your day is packed caring for others. It’s important to take time for self-care. You need to get exercise, eat properly, and have time for your personal appointments and errands. Caregiving is a demanding job. Respite care services from FirstLight Home Care allow you to take some time off from your responsibilities as a primary caregiver so that you can focus on yourself for a while.
Find Time for Sleep: The more sleep you can get, the more you will be effective and emotionally fit. Sleep is your best ally during these stressful times. Take naps when needed.
Ask for and Accept Help: Asking for help is not a negative thing. When caring for others, unexpected challenges will come up. You can’t anticipate or plan for all the obstacles that lie ahead. Children will get sick. Parents will have unexpected appointments. And the family caregiver will have personal engagements and errands to take care of. It’s okay to call for backup and ask for help from friends and family members. There are many ways to get some assistance:
- Join a carpool group for your kids to help them get to and from school and sports or extracurricular activities
- Find a home care agency that provides companion care or personal care to support your parents
- Use online delivery services – for example, grocery store delivery – to reduce the number of weekly errands on your “to do” list
- Be specific on the help you need when talking with family, friends and outside resources
- Stop by your local senior center to see what community support groups or services you or your parents could benefit from
Be Positive: A sandwiched caregiver can become overwhelmed, which can lead to a lack of enthusiasm and negativity. It’s important to see the good in your caregiving situation. Being positive will fuel your spirit and help you to avoid feeling bitter and burdened. Make sure to find time to be around people who are positive and supportive. Surround yourself with loved ones and support groups who make you feel good and don’t deplete you of energy.
Are you a member of the sandwich generation? If so, how do you find balance with all that you are responsible for? Feel free to comment below or join our “finding balance” conversation we’re having over on our Facebook page.

280,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/finding-comfort-in-caregiver-support/,"Most of us, at some point in our lives, will become a caregiver in some way. It could be helping an elderly parent, someone with a chronic illness or a disabled family member. In fact, family caregivers now encompass more than one in five Americans.
Many family caregivers don’t think of themselves in that way. They simply believe they are doing the right thing by being there for their loved one.
Caregiving can include many responsibilities, from grocery shopping, light housekeeping and laundry to transportation and medication management. Separately, these things might not seem demanding or daunting but trying to do everything for a loved one – on top of taking care of your own family – can be overwhelming. If you are feeling stressed, isolated or exhausted, take action to get caregiver support today.
- We know that each caregiving situation is unique. But we have also seen that many of the biggest challenges family caregivers face are similar. Being open and aware of these challenges may help you recognize the signs before you experience burnout.
- Respite care, or temporary relief from your caregiving tasks, is critical. As the demand for a loved one’s care increases, oftentimes family caregivers feel inundated with responsibilities, and sometimes they feel guilty for needing some time to themselves. A family caregiver can experience burnout from his or her duties, so taking time off must be a priority. Here is why respite care is essential for family caregivers.
- If you or the family caregiver in your life is dealing with compassion fatigue or caregiver burnout, here’s how to tell the difference between the two, along with advice on how caregiver support can help reduce these feelings.
- Taking care of someone you love is rewarding, but it does come with its own challenges. Read these six things you must ask yourself before becoming your parent’s caregiver.

281,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/finding-right-in-home-caregiver/,"In November, we celebrate National Home Care Month and National Family Caregivers Month, two observances that are core to FirstLight Home Care. Throughout the month, our FirstLight blog will focus on providing the tools, tips, resources and peace of mind so many family caregivers need. The first step is finding the right in-home caregiver. We invite you to comment and share the challenges and rewarding experiences you’ve encountered throughout your caregiving journey.
Home care can be a lifeline for seniors who are aging in place, as well as those living with a disability or recovering from an illness or injury. Finding the right in-home caregiver can seem like a daunting task. It can be difficult knowing where to begin and what to look for when it comes to choosing the right caregiving partner for you or your loved one.
Essential to any home care partnership is the caregiver. Here are some important factors to consider to ensure you hire the right in-home caregiver:
Expertise and credibility. It takes a special kind of person to be an exceptional caregiver – compassion, empathy, optimism, sincerity, trustworthiness. But the best caregivers also are qualified, experienced and reliable.
Find a provider that has years of experience in the home care industry.
Look for providers who have a thorough process for recruiting, selecting and retaining their caregivers.
Make sure all caregivers that are hired receive an in-depth background check and other appropriate employment screenings.
Your home care partner should also secure and uphold the appropriate state licensing to provide services.
Ongoing caregiver training. Select a partner that values ongoing and rigorous caregiver training and that has a well-defined process for managing quality of care. The right in-home caregiver will be trained in privacy issues to protect the confidentiality and safety of clients. The best caregivers are those who participate in continuing education.
Client-caregiver fit. Each person is unique. Look for a home care partner that is committed to matching the caregiver to the specific interests and needs of the unique individual being cared for. The most successful client-caregiver relationships are fostered when the caregiver is a good fit for the style, temperament, needs, interests and personality of the client.
Communication with the family. It’s common for individuals who need assistance to have a family member or other loved involved in their care. The right in-home caregiver will engage the family in the ongoing care plan of the individual. Transparency also is key. Families should have complete access to tools that monitor their loved ones’ schedule and communicate with caregivers daily.
Commitment to client satisfaction. The best home care providers are those that continually assess the quality of care their caregivers are delivering. This includes:
- Regular check-ins with clients to ensure safety and quality standards are being met.
- Resolving issues in a timely, thorough and caring manner.
- Offering clients the opportunity to participate in surveys and to provide feedback
If you believe that hiring a caregiver would provide a needed lifeline for you or a loved one, FirstLight Home Care offers a broad range of non-medical home care services. With locations in more than 150 markets across the United States, we can help you or your loved one achieve and maintain independence in whatever place you call home. And with an unmatched Culture of Care, we can also help enhance quality of life. Find a FirstLight location today to request a free consultation."
282,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/fireworks-safety-tips-for-summer-fun/,"It’s officially summer. Time for outdoor family fun, celebrations and of course fireworks.
If not handled properly, fireworks can cause burn and eye injuries in kids and adults. The best way to protect your family this summer from accidents is to not use them at home — period. Instead, attend public 4th of July celebrations, and leave the lighting to the professionals.
It’s important to note that lighting fireworks at home might not be legal in your community, so if you still want to use them, be sure to check with your local police department first. If they’re legal where you live, keep these safety tips from The National Council on Fireworks Safety in mind:
- Obey all local laws
- Know what you’re getting into before igniting – read the cautionary labels and performance descriptions
- A responsible adult SHOULD always be present and supervising
- Alcohol and fireworks do not mix. Save your alcohol for after the show
- Wear safety glasses
- Light one at a time and then quickly move away
- Ignite fireworks OUTDOORS in a clear area; away from buildings and vehicles
- Never relight a “dud” – wait 20 minutes and then soak it in a bucket of water
- Always have a bucket of water and a connected water hose nearby
- Never carry them in your POCKET or shoot them into METAL or GLASS containers
- Do not experiment with homemade displays
- After igniting, dispose by wetting them down and place in a metal trash can away from any building or combustible materials until the next day
- FAA regulations PROHIBIT the possession and transportation of fireworks in your checked baggage or carry-on luggage
- Report illegal explosives, like M-80s and quarter sticks, to the fire or police department
And let’s not forget the safety of our pets!
- Don’t bring your pets to fireworks display, even small local events
- Keep your pet in a safe, interior room to avoid exposure to the sound
- Make sure your pet has an identification tag, in case it runs off from the noise
- Never shoot off any fireworks near pets
There are many amazing community 4th of July displays across the country, where’s your favorite place to watch fireworks? Leave a comment below or join the conversation over on Facebook. From all of us at FirstLight Home Care we wish you and your family a safe and fabulous summer!"
283,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/first-time-blood-donor/,"Did you know that every time you donate blood, you could be saving three lives? That you can store your own blood for future needs?
There are many myths about blood donation and its safety after the initial scare in the 1990s when unsafe blood banking practices came to light due to people contracting HIV and hepatitis. However, the FDA put rigid guidelines into place to ensure sterile procedures and proper equipment disposal.
About 5 million people get blood transfusions every year. They are often necessary after surgery, an injury, cancer treatments, heart surgeries, organ transplants or for those with sickle cell anemia. For instance, one liver transplant can require up to 120 units of blood!
With January being Blood Donor Month, it’s important that we all realize that there’s never enough blood in the blood banks. The Red Cross, which represents virtually all U.S. blood banks, often faces shortages, so they need our help. The amount of blood needed to fill our blood banks is incredible … see these facts from The Red Cross:
- Every two seconds someone in the U.S. needs blood.
- More than 41,000 blood donations are needed every day.
- The blood type most often requested is Type O.
- Although an estimated 38% of the U.S. population is eligible to donate, less than 10% actually do.
About Blood Donation
Here’s some important information if you’re thinking about donating blood:
- Age. You must be at least 16 or 17 to donate blood (depending on your state).
- Weight. You must weigh at least 110 pounds and be in good health. Double red cell donors must meet different criteria.
- Time. Plan on spending approximately 1 ½ – 2 hours at your appointment (depending on your type of donation), although the donation itself takes only 8 – 10 minutes.
- Types of Donations.
- Whole Blood Donations
- Platelet Donations
- Plasma Donations
- Double Red Cell Donations
- Frequency.
- You can donate blood every eight weeks (for whole blood), every 7 days for platelets (up to 24 times/year), every 28 days for plasma (up to 13 times a year), and every 112 days (up to three times/year) for double red blood cell donations.
What Is Autologous Blood Banking?
Autologous blood banking or storing your own blood is the best way to make sure you don’t have an adverse reaction to incompatible donated blood during a medical procedure or that you never receive tainted blood. Although allergies to transfused blood are rare, it can occur even if you receive the right blood type.
If you are having an upcoming surgery, talk to your doctor in advance about storing your blood. Know that most hospital can only store it for 35 days unless they offer long-term frozen blood storage. There are some private facilities such as Idant Laboratories that can store blood for up to 10 years. These blood banks can send it to you at any time overnight and it will take less than 60 – 90 minutes to thaw. Under these circumstances, most people store two units of blood.
The Red Cross is always seeking sponsors for blood drives, blood donors and volunteers to work in the clinics. The importance of neighbors helping neighbors in need can’t be minimized. To find a local blood drive in your area, click here."

Truly extraordinary people who are providing exceptional care and to whom I am very proud to say I am on their team. We welcomed 65 franchisees, employees and caregivers to the event at The Ritz-Carlton in downtown Atlanta, Ga. The three day event incorporated panels and roundtable sessions on best tips and practices of successful networking, effective management, administration and training techniques, plus focus groups for recruiting, advertising, social media and care coordination. Special presentations from industry experts and guest speakers were also heard.
We took the opportunity to bestow top franchisees with prestigious awards in many categories including Client Satisfaction Leaders, Fast Start Office, Rookie of the Year and Franchisee of the Year. Congratulations to all recipients and all other franchisees that have all made positive contributions to the FirstLight team.
Special thanks to our sponsors: Hafenbrack Marketing, See Janet Work, Spectrum TeleTrack Services, SilverStone Group and Home Care Pulse who helped us orchestrate such a successful gathering."
286,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/firstlight-celebrates-success-with-first-annual-conference/,"Our first annual national conference last week was a huge success! A sincere thank you to each and every franchisee, employee and caregiver who made it to the conference at Big Cedar Resort—I firmly believe we have the best team in the industry.
The three day event incorporated panels and roundtable sessions on best tips and practices of successful networking, effective management, administration and training techniques, plus focus groups for recruiting, advertising, social media and care coordination. Special presentations from industry experts and guest speakers were also heard.
The event gave me the opportunity to bestow top franchisees and caregivers with prestigious awards. Among them, Lake Mary, Fla.-based owner Tammy Iuso was named Franchisee of the Year, based on her ability to exemplify FirstLight’s Culture of Care and its service-oriented operating system, maintain highest measurements of client satisfaction, and achieve highest revenues for the last 12 month period.
Over the past year, Tammy has shown extreme dedication to her business, earning the highest achievements as a single territory owner. It was a hard decision, with so many deserving owners, but Tammy proved herself and exceeded our expectations as a new franchisee.
Additionally, Maria Wichmann was named Caregiver of the Year, which acknowledges the highest level of service, care, compassion and resourcefulness in providing care to FirstLight clients. The Caregiver of the Year and Franchisee of the Year awards are reserved for exceptional performance and positive contribution to the system.
Maria demonstrates empathy and compassion toward those receiving care by her concern and commitment to professionalism. She is a leader to all caregivers by offering suggestions and encouragement to others and even her supervisors to reinforce our Culture of Care, which is already an industry leader in client satisfaction.
The outcome of the event was an accurate reflection of FirstLight’s continued efforts to provide the highest quality and professional care to seniors and their families. I’m already looking forward to next year’s conference! Keep up the fantastic work! Stay tuned for photos from the event."
287,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/firstlight-client-celebrates-105th-birthday-in-the-house-he-built-by-hand/,"Most people would consider living to your mid-90’s an accomplishment by itself, but what if you heard that a man just turned 105 years old, and is still living in the house that he built 65 years ago?
Well that actually happened last month when FirstLight client Bill Mohr, a World War II veteran of Hatboro, Pennsylvania, celebrated his 105th birthday with his wife, Jo, and the rest of their family. That same day, he and Jo shared their 70th wedding anniversary and he also received an honorary high school diploma from St. Joseph Preparatory School. He received a full scholarship to the school as an 8th grader but dropped out after two years to work to support his widowed mother and their family.
Most senior citizens at this age would be in nursing homes or hospice care, but Bill and Jo split their time between Florida and their Hatboro house. This can be attributed to the round-the-clock in home care provided by FirstLight Home Care of Bucks County, Pennsylvania.
“We have been really fortunate that my parents have been able to age in place. Most people their age would be in nursing homes,” said their daughter Jodie Hartshorne, age 63. “They thrive if they can stay in their own home and be taken care of. This is a critical issue in America, how to take care of the aging population.”
As a part of the celebration of their seven decades of marriage, Jo and Bill renewed their vows to each other. After the ceremony Bill said that he has always wanted to visit Ireland, so his daughter is currently working on putting that together.
Thanks to the care provided by FirstLight, the couple who have combined to live over two centuries, are still living independently in their own home with plans to travel the country, and aspirations for the world. Watch a video of Bill and Jo’s celebration on Mashable.com!"

FirstLight Home Care is a proud supporter of Legacy List with Matt Paxton, an Emmy-nominated series about the precious memories attached to the hidden treasures inside our homes.
Legacy List features families from across the country who are ready to downsize. The show explores the challenges between holding on to the past and embracing the future; it also stresses the importance of sharing family stories above keeping objects. Each episode follows one family’s emotional journey as Matt and his team help them sort through a house full of memories.
Matt Paxton is a leading downsizing and decluttering expert. He started after his father, stepfather and both grandfathers died in the same year, leaving him with several estates to settle all at once. Ever since, Matt and his network of experts have been working with families struggling with settling estates and cleanouts for almost 20 years. His expertise has been featured during 13 seasons of the hit A&E TV show HOARDERS. Matt also appears regularly as a public speaker, television and radio personality, helping families find the upside of downsizing.
FirstLight Home Care is proud to be a national underwriter of the show. Season 3 of Legacy List with Matt Paxton premiered this month on public television and on PBS.org (check local listings). The series is produced by MY Entertainment and Shipyard Entertainment in association with VPM, Virginia’s home for public media, and distributed by American Public Television (APT)."

292,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/firstlight-homecare-prevents-caregiver-burnout/,"If you are a family caregiver for a loved one, you know it can take an emotional, financial and physical toll on your own well being. Chances are you have a job, a family of your own, and are trying to juggle it all. You become your last priority.
The end result? Caregiver burnout and exhaustion.
Don’t people realize you are only one person and you can only accomplish so much? No.
What Are Some Symptoms of Caregiver Burnout?
Although caring for a loved one can be rewarding, it can also be extremely stressful. You may not see any light in your future because the person you are caring for has a chronic illness. You have to realize you put not only yourself at risk, but the person you are caring for as well. Do you see yourself in the following symptoms?
- Anxiety and depression
- Sleeping problems
- Irritation and anger
- Lethargy and lack of energy
- Snapping at minor problems
- Drinking or smoking too much to take the edge off
- Trouble concentrating
- Withdrawal from friends
- Neglecting your own problems and getting sick more often
- Feeling like your life is spiraling out of control
It’s time to give yourself a break. Literally. Taking time to rest and recharge is not a luxury. It’s a necessity.
Easing Your Stress
So what can you do to ease some of the burdens? Give yourself permission to take some time off on your own terms. If not, your poor health will eventually force you to at a time that might be highly inconvenient!
- Vent. Many times all you need is a sympathetic ear, someone to express your feelings to. You need an outlet for your frustrations. Your immediate family may be tired of hearing about it – find a girlfriend of co-worker to confide in. Just telling someone else what you are going through can be cathartic, even if the situation can’t change.
- Time for yourself. You will not be able to help anyone if you exhaust yourself or try and keep a frenetic pace for too long. Don’t say you have no options, because there are always options. Plan on spending at least 30 minutes a week on YOURSELF to pamper yourself. Treat yourself to a spa day or plan a date night out. Anything that makes you feel good about yourself is a good activity.
- Ask for help. People can’t read your mind and know what help you need. Many times friends or church friends want to help, but they don’t want to intrude. If they offer to help, never be too proud to accept! Start parcelling out responsibility, even to long-distance family members. People are always willing to run errands, cook meals or even clean the house. Set up a schedule so you don’t overwhelm any individual. Don’t micromanage or insist on doing things your way.
- Remember to laugh. Too often we get caught up on negativity. Try and find some humor in the situation, no matter how small. Laughter is a great way to reduce stress. Watch a funny movie or read a funny book. A positive attitude can go a long way in keeping you sane.
- Get training. Too often family caregivers are asked to help with healthcare needs but lack the training to provide the services. If you need guidance administering shots, IVs, or cleaning catheters, there are many social workers or state services that can send out a nurse practitioner to help.
- Don’t berate yourself. If you sometimes think bad things about the person you are caring for, don’t feel guilty. This is normal. Instead, try and turn it around and focus on the good things that have come about. Maybe you are able to get closer to your Mom or Dad. Or possibly, it created a new relationship with their grandkids.
Tried all these things but haven’t found any relief? Get outside help. At FirstLight Home Care Surprise, we offer respite help so caregivers can take a break. Maybe it’s once a week or once/month for a few hours. We offer professional caregivers who can act as a pinch hitter for you! The much needed break will allow you to re-focus and re-energize. You will be a better caregiver for it."
293,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/firstlight-homecare-salutes-the-american-red-cross/,"Did you know that the logo for the American Red Cross is one of the best recognized insignias in the world?
That the Red Cross has won more Nobel Peace Prizes than anyone?
And with good reason. After such natural disasters as Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy, their disaster relief team was one of the first on the scene, distributing much needed food and medical supplies, providing shelters to keep warm, and dispensing the necessities we often take for granted – a clean toothbrush, shampoo and deodorant. Although they respond to more than 70,000 natural disasters each year, many people do not realize how many individual families the Red Cross helps through everything from a single house fire to a critical blood donation.
In fact, every two seconds someone in the U.S. needs blood, adding up to 41,000 donations that are needed each day. The American Red Cross is the largest single supplier of blood and blood products in the U.S. A donation of one pint of blood can save up to three lives. With the temperatures dropping around the country this winter, the Red Cross is running in short supply. Might be time for all of us to get out there and donate.
The Red Cross is also integral in helping military families and their loved ones, whether they are stationed far away or in the U.S. If a family member has a crisis at home, the Red Cross provides emergency communications services to link service members with their families.
Or maybe if have taken a CPR course or First Aid, chances are it was sponsored by the American Red Cross. They provide swimming and babysitting courses, advanced childcare courses and emergency preparedness training. These are life skills we should all learn.
With March being American Red Cross Month, FirstLight Home Care would just like to say a hearty thank you to all the volunteers, blood donors and emergency personnel who help those in need."

We’re proud to announce that this conference was our biggest conference and most-well attended in FirstLight Home Care history to date! Our owners eagerly arrived in anticipation of the conference’s itinerary and events.
For this conference, we wanted to specifically focus on a few items; owner and/or manager networking, and it’s value, which we emphasized with extra, devoted time to allow our owners and managers to network with other managers and owners, sponsors, vendors, and speakers. We fully believe that one of the most powerful aspects of being a part of a franchise is the opportunity to network with other owners and provide support among each other. We also focused on the psychology behind referral sources and the decision process in choosing to refer certain home care agencies versus others, and why FirstLight Home Care is often at the top of referral sources’ lists. We feel it’s vital for our owners to understand the decision-making process, as well as the characteristics and qualities that are measured, compared, and evaluated among families and referral sources when choosing a home care agency, and how FirstLight Home Care ranks in importance among those attributes. All of our keynote speakers were highly regarded with strong, positive feedback from all of our owners, managers, and participants, and we hope to have them speak and inspire us again.
FirstLight Home Care, as an entire franchise system, was honored by one of our sponsors, Home Care Pulse, during conference with the award of “National Provider Best in Home Care.” We are incredibly excited, proud, and humbled to receive this award, and it is our goal to continually earn this title each year.
On our final night in Colorado we celebrated our owners’ accomplishments and hard work with several awards:
Caregiver of the Year Award: Congratulations Tammy Morgan! This award is given to a FirstLight Home Care caregiver each year nominated for providing above and beyond service, displaying a positive and enthusiastic attitude despite any circumstances.

This might surprise you – according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that more than a third of adults ages 65 and older fall each year. Statistics show that every 18 to 20 seconds an older adult ends up in the emergency room because of a fall, many of which happen in their own homes.
Most elderly people living at home do not take the appropriate safeguards within their home to reduce the risk of falling. This month is a great time to stop by the homes of aging parents, neighbors and others within our communities and do a home safety assessment.
Sheena Jaffer, CASP, CAPS, ASA Member and graduate of ASA’s 2012 Leadership Academy, is pursuing her lifelong calling to be an advocate for elders has 12 useful tips to help keep our aging parents and family members safe and living at their homes. While this list may not encompass every potential hazard, it will serve as a good, practical start.
- Keep a printed list of emergency and family phone numbers in large font. Inserted in a clear plastic sleeve close to the telephone, in the bedroom and-or kitchen.
- Place lamps and a cordless phone within easy reach of the bed or often-used chair.
- Ensure there is a clear pathway between the bedroom and bathroom.
- Set up nightlights in the bedroom and bathroom.
- Keep a flashlight close to the bedside and another in the kitchen in case of emergencies.
- Discard all throw rugs.
- Ensure suitable chair heights, including tub and toilet seats.
- Double check shoes for proper fit, preferably they are low heels and slippers with non-skid soles.
- Ensure there is a long-handled shoehorn to assist putting on footwear.
- Organize clothes and necessities so they are within easy reach.
- Maintain assistance devices, such as walkers, canes, wheelchairs and others in good working order.
- Explore the latest safety and security assistance technologies that might facilitate an optimal quality of life.

297,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/firstlight-homecare-takes-care-of-dads-even-if-they-are-cranky/,"My Dad is cranky. Okay, if I’m going to tell the truth, he has moments where he is downright mean. He gets easily agitated and has times of lucidity coupled with flashes where he doesn’t even know my name. It is frustrating, heartbreaking and exhausting, not only for myself – the adult daughter — but my whole family as well.
But it must be worse for him. Thirteen years ago, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and it turned his life and our lives upside down. Six years ago, right before my Mom died, I promised her I would never put him in an assisted living facility. She had kept him at home for five years prior and she was 75, so how hard could it be?
Unfortunately, the reality of the situation was other than childbirth and raising a recalcitrant teenager, it’s the hardest thing I have ever done.
In the Beginning
The early years were easier. When Dad came to live with us it was an adjustment, but he was able to adapt to our family routine and we adjusted to his idiosyncrasies. Really … cutting your toenails and flossing your teeth in front of the den TV?
Since both my husband and I work full-time and my two kids are very active, Dad came with us to tennis matches, softball games, and family outings. Since Dad loves to do woodwork, we set up a shop in our garage so it would feel more like home to him. We brought his favorite Lazy Boy and bedroom furniture over from his former home, so he would have something comfortable and familiar.
He was able to stay by himself all day, with a neighbor bringing him lunch.
A Turn for the Worse
At first the changes were subtle. He would take a walk around the block and get lost. He became agitated more quickly. Although he hadn’t driven in many years, he found the car keys, and tried to back the car out of the garage without lifting the garage door. Oi vai! We knew it was time to get help with home care.
We hired a neighbor’s friend to take care of him, but then she moved. We hired a homecare agency, but the caregivers were unable to tolerate his moods and tantrums. Then finally a close friend of mind recommended FirstLight Home Care and it was truly a blessing. A male caregiver (Tim) came in four days a week from 8 to 5PM. I adjusted my work schedule to have Fridays off. Because FirstLight Home Care has a dementia care program, they developed a dementia plan and a schedule we all stuck to. The routine was definitely easier on my Dad and provided peace of mind for me.
I’ll be honest. Full-time home care is not cheap. However, because my Dad was a veteran, we received some assistance. My parents had lived modestly, so between their savings, my Dad’s social security check, his VA benefits and our salaries, we made it work. It was definitely the best alternative to a difficult situation.
One Year Later
My Dad passed away on April 20, 2012. This will be my first Father’s Day without him and I miss him terribly, even with all the upheavals. While you’re helping a parent with Alzheimer’s, you sometimes forget to stop and enjoy the lighter moments … the laughter and the little things like when my Dad picked the dandelions out of the yard and made me a flower bouquet. I even miss Tim, the family caregiver, because he quickly became a member of our family. His enthusiasm and caring was a bright spot in some difficult days.
Soon it will be time to disassemble my Dad’s woodworking shop. Even though I had plenty of time to prepare for his death, the end is just so final it breaks your heart. Growing up, my Dad called me “Sugar”. I would give anything to see one last wink, feel one last bear hug, and hear “have a great day sugar!”"

Joni will share her insight and expertise on caregiving with a blog post on the 15th of each month. Understanding first-hand the challenges, anguish, and even rewards that are associated with caring for loved ones, Joni will offer advice and suggestions and share her own trials and tribulations. It was her extensive care for her late husband, mother, and now her boyfriend that inspired Joni to share her knowledge and support with fellow caregivers as well as current cancer fighters. With her, you will always have a friend to make sense of the medical jargon, a mentor to keep you updated on current medical research, and an ally within the cancer community. Joni wants others to understand that they are not alone.
Joni has established a strong following as an author of several influential books ranging in topics from her personal story as a caregiver in her book “The Saving of Gordon: Lifelines to W-I-N Against Cancer,” to guidance on creating lasting connections with your own loved ones in journals such as “Our Daily Connection.” She also offers helpful guides to aid in the process of recovery, such as a workbook to document doctor’s visits and a journal to reflect on the process.
Joni also spreads her knowledge and support as a national inspirational speaker on topics such as “Living to Give: What it Takes to be a Caregiver,” and “How to W-I-N Against Cancer: Finding the Right Treatment Facility and Oncologist.”

Gina Kaurich, FirstLight Home Care’s executive director of client care services, was recently interviewed by FamilyGoesStrong.com about things to consider when looking for a caregiver. One of Gina’s suggestions was to try a “share-care” with other family members. This is what she and her in-laws did with her mother-in-law Martha who suffers from Alzheimer’s.
According to Gina, you should ask yourself how much time you’re available to care for your family member—in her case, both her and her husband worked full-time and eventually enlisted in a FirstLight caregiver to help out with Martha.
Making the decision to hire a caregiver is never easy but to read more about Gina’s tips, check out the full article on FamilyGoesStrong.com."

As the premiere FirstLight franchise in the Omaha market, the Ockens’ business will service West Omaha, Fremont, Arlington, Bennington and Elkhorn.
“We have seen how everything has changed to accommodate the baby boomers, and one of the things that will change is home care is going to be more of an option for insurance companies [with regard to] paying for their aging clients,” Nancy told the Midlands Business Journal in an article that was published earlier this month. “They simply cannot afford to put everybody in a nursing home, and it’s not as good of an option or as economical for their clients.”
After more than 15 years spent growing a successful hardwood flooring company, the couple is excited to apply their entrepreneurial backgrounds to their new endeavor. They’ve already hired Joanne Bonifant, a former head of the Critical Care Unit at Methodist Hospital, as FirstLight’s care coordinator. They plan to build their business throughout West Omaha and eventually expand further into Omaha and Lincoln.
“Even though opening a business in a tough economy can be challenging, we are eager to build a successful operation that community members can rely on,” said Nancy. “We also know in these challenging times, people don’t have the luxury of staying home to care for their ailing parents; FirstLight provides a reliable solution.”

301,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/firstlight-offers-unique-approach-to-dementia-care/,"As the number of people suffering from Alzheimer’s continues to rise, so does the number of unpaid caregivers. According to a recent article in USA Today, nearly 15 million unpaid caregivers in the U.S. help someone with Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia. Any family member or caregiver can tell you that caring for a person with dementia is not an easy, glamorous job; it’s often filled with stress and exhaustion.
Although there is no cure for Alzheimer’s, increasing awareness and education of the disease, and planning for care in the early stages can help relieve much of the stress associated with it. FirstLight has recognized this need and realizes that not every dementia patient requires the same treatment. That’s why we’ve rolled out a unique Dementia Program that is specifically tailored around the individual—it’s a personalized, engaging approach to dementia care. Our care coordinators customize a daily care plan for your loved one based on their needs. We just unveiled a new webpage highlighting our dementia program, check it out here: www.firstlighthomecare.com/services/dementia-program
Our goal is to help those affected by dementia live the rest of their lives with purpose. It’s important to remember the great person they were and still are."

One of our favorite holiday traditions is to find a Saturday afternoon where we turn everything off (minus our Christmas lights), start a fire in the fireplace, grab a warm beverage, find the coziest blanket in the house and watch our favorite holiday movies. We have found this to be a great way to get re-energized and excited about the holiday season.
Join our tradition! Here are a few of our favorite holiday movies (not in any particular order mind you):
- It’s a Wonderful Life
- How the Grinch Stole Christmas (the 1966 animated version)
- Elf
- Home Alone
- Miracle on 34th Street (the 1947 black and white version)

305,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/five-tips-for-long-distance-caregiving/,"Caring for a loved one that lives locally can be stressful, yet caring for one that is long distance can extenuate the circumstances immensely. There are a number of responsibilities in both situations, and in a long distance situation it is imperative that you
feel comfortable delegating some of these responsibilities to others. With that said, it is necessary for you to embrace communication among the family and those that are able to help locally. Each family has unique situations, and something that works for one family may not work for others. We have provided five tips that may be helpful during the care giving process.
- Research your loved ones treatment. Locally or long distance, this is important. As distance becomes greater, it requires you to delegate out care for your loved one, make sure to understand the treatment they need so that it is reliably communicated to those helping locally.
- Plan for an emergency. It is one thing if you are a phone call away, but if this isn’t possible, make sure you have an emergency plan in place and that all involved know about it. Make sure to have a list of emergency numbers easily accessible to your loved one in need and provide step-by-step instructions. The more everyone knows, the better an emergency situation will end.
- Have confidence and trust in those helping. The best people to “take your place” are other loved ones around the person being cared for. Don’t be afraid to ask them for help. If it is necessary for you to seek out local care services, take time to find ones that fit their needs as well as yours, and that you feel comfortable with.
- Communication with your loved one is key. It would be wise to keep constant communication with your loved one whom you are caring for. A daily conversation, even if for a short minute, is safe, and a good way to keep informed as to how they are feeling and if their needs have changed.
- Do not take financial responsibility on by yourself. Make sure to find someone, most likely a financial advisor, who can help your loved one with his or her financial needs. Monetary arguments, too many times, can get in the middle of valued family relationships. Allow you to focus on their health and leave finances to experienced professionals."
306,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/five-tips-to-effectively-communicate-with-seniors/,"In his book How to Say It to Seniors, author David Solie, who specializes in geriatric issues, describes the developmental tasks that the elderly face, and explains how these
“tasks shape their behavior — whether they’re aware of it or not”. Solie describes the “crises of the elderly as a conflict between control and legacy issues. And while he writes in universal terms, it’s important to remember that every individual is different, and each person’s experience of aging will have a lot to do with personal and environmental factors, as well as developmental ones.”
While communication is extremely important with your parents, it can also be a difficult task. However, if you try and understand their experiences of aging and use these five tips, talking with your parents will hopefully become more pleasant of an activity.
- When speaking of concern, use “I” more than “You”. For example, “I am concerned about you driving at night.” instead of “You are too old to drive at night.” The latter causes a need to defend and the conversation can become ineffective quickly.
- Maintain eye contact. Eye contact is a polite gesture and continues to give them a sense of control. Make sure you look your parents in the eye when speaking to them. This will also help them understand your feelings of concern if they can see it in your eyes.
- Speak clearly. As your parents age, hearing diminishes. There is nothing more stressful than not being able to hear what you are saying. For their sake, and yours, speak up and clearly.
- One of the most difficult parts of aging is losing control. As dementia sets in, your parents’ ability to make decisions goes away. In this trying time, continue to provide your parents with a sense of control by giving them options. Options allow them to play a part in their care without requiring too much depth in thought. For example, “Would you like me to take you to the grocery store at noon or 3:00?” Its sounds so minimal, but that type of communication will go a long way.
- Communicate when enough is enough. It is important that you do not take over too much of the care-taking role. You want to continue a positive parent/child relationship, thus, it is very important to communicate with your parents this. Make sure to give them some time to process if new caretakers will be assisting in their needs."
307,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/five-ways-can-age-better-starting-today/,"It is a fact of life that we all age each day; however, there are ways that you and the seniors in your life can be proactive to help age “better” each and every day. From incorporating exercise into a daily routine or using mental quizzes to help stay sharp and focused, finding ways to age better can improve the quality of your life.
Aging better doesn’t have to mean that you or the seniors in your life have to change everything that is done on a daily basis, but incorporating small changes each day. As home care providers, we’ve worked with families in a variety of different ways to help seniors enhance their quality of life through these 5 ways to age better today.
- Get Exercise: Regardless of your age, engaging in some type of regular exercise can help you age better. Walking, biking, weight training—no matter what type of exercise you are interested in, having a regular exercise time each day can help slow down the aging process. A study in the New York Times showed that exercise makes our muscles work better with age, so find new ways to incorporate exercise each day!
- Sleep well: A lack of sleep can be detrimental to one’s well-being, contributing to depression, skin aging, and weight gain and a survey by the Better Sleep Council found that 48 percent of Americans say they don’t get enough sleep. Making sure that you find the time for great sleep by removing distractions and allowing yourself to rest and sleep well will assist you in getting higher quality sleep to age well!
- Take a brain teaser: As we age, our brains often have to work harder to remember information, so find ways to maintain your mental acuity by engaging in brain teasers or other cognitive thinking tasks that help keep your focus.
- Stay current: Another wonderful way to keep your mental edge is through reading; finding a great book to read can help you age better. If you have trouble reading small print, use a large print book or even listen to an audio book to help you stay engaged. In addition, staying current with the latest trends and information through magazines, websites and other information sources can help you feel more involved and current with the world around you.
- Socialize and engage: As we get older, we tend to limit our social interactions to a small circle of individuals and family; get out there and meet people! The old adage of “You are as old as you feel” can often be true, so break out of your comfort zone by socializing and engaging with others. Impart your wisdom with younger individuals and let them teach you about current ideologies to help you feel younger and age better.
Even though we are all aging every day, we can be proactive in finding ways to age better starting as early as today. Exercise, sleep well, keep your focus, stay current and socialize with others to help you feel younger and invigorated, regardless of what may be happening in your life. As caregivers, the team at FirstLight Home Care knows that a great attitude can help brighten your day, so get out there and find your own way to age better…today!"
308,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/for-caregivers-laughter-is-the-best-medicine/,"It’s no secret that caring for an aging family member can be a very stressful role. But that doesn’t mean that caregivers – and their loved ones – can’t spend a few moments of the day finding the humor in life. For caregivers, laughing can be a lifesaver.
According to research by the Mayo Clinic, data suggests that laughter really is some of the best medicine out there.
In the short term, laughter:
- Enhances your oxygen intake, which stimulates the heart, lungs and muscles
- Increases the production of endorphins, which helps relieve stress
- Soothes tensions by stimulating circulation and muscle relaxation, which reduces the physical symptoms of stress.
In the long term, laughing:
- Improves your immune system. Both positive and negative thoughts produce chemical reactions in the body. Replace that negative energy with the release of neuropeptides that fight stress and are released when the brain experiences positive energy, such as laughter.
- Relieves pain. As mentioned above, laughter releases endorphins. These hormones work as a natural pain reliever because they produce dopamine that helps us feel happy and stimulated.
- Improves your mood. Let’s face it – when you’re laughing, bad thoughts get pushed out of your mind. Not only does it help you cope with the situation at hand, but laughter also improves your self-esteem.
Medical research aside, anyone who has experienced prolonged laughter knows that it just feels good to giggle and joke with loved ones. To help you and your senior loved one manage the many activities involved in caregiving, here are some ways to introduce humor into your daily routine:
- Search for the funny. Whether you find funny anecdotes in articles to relate to your loved one, tell a joke or two, or watch comedies on television, set aside time during the day to simply enjoy one another’s company.
- Get online. There are endless appropriate videos of funny events on YouTube and other video streaming services that you and your senior can enjoy.
- Ask your loved one to tell you funny stories. Your senior probably has some funny stories from their youth they would be happy to tell. Most people don’t get through life without something hilarious happening along the way and reliving them can often be just as funny.
- Consider laughter yoga. Laughter yoga is a real practice where people laugh as a group. The laughter is forced, at first, but soon turns spontaneous. If you’ve heard the saying, “Laugh and the world laughs with you …” then you can understand the motivations behind laughter yoga.
- Laugh at daily life. Don’t be afraid to laugh when something funny happens during your daily routine. Caregiving can provide rich opportunities for the funny to simply happen and it’s not irreverent to laugh when it does. Just be careful to laugh with your loved one and not at them.
- Invite friends over. If you or your loved one has entertaining friends, feel free to have them over for lunch or dinner. Not only does having a new face break up the routine for a much-needed change but having a funny or entertaining exchange makes the visit that much more enjoyable.
- Get silly. Don’t be afraid to mix it up. Try on funny wigs and outfits, dance around the room laugh out loud. Acting somewhat silly can often break up the monotony of daily life. And if it gets the people around you to laugh as well, then the more the merrier.
For most caregivers, this chapter in their lives and in the lives of their senior is often the last moments in time they will be spending together. Joy can be found in simple things: a joke, a shared funny moment or time spent watching hilarious videos.
The act of caregiving can often make you feel overwhelmed, anxious or even depressed. Instead of focusing on the negative aspects that are too often a part of caregiving, a good laugh can push those negative thoughts out of your mind and help you find the simple joy in caregiving.

309,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/for-seniors-low-tech-market-yields-high-returns/,"From Blackberries to Droids to iPhones, the world of cell phone technology continues to outdo itself. But this week, I noticed that Tigard, Ore.-based phone company Consumer Cellular has opted to buck the trend and steer its mission in the opposite direction.
Recently, The Portland State Daily Vanguard ran an engaging piece on how Consumer Cellular is marketing its stripped down cell phone models to the senior citizens. Instead of touting oodles of multi-functionary applications, the company has designed phones with bigger buttons that are easier to see and push. And in addition to being hearing aid compatible, basic plans start at only $20 per month—a big perk for the budget conscious.
While the piece discusses the pros and cons of marketing exclusively to the senior sector, the overall mission of connecting older and younger generations demands applause. Last fall, I read about how the technology gap is threatening to turn our seniors into second class citizens. And while the claim may grossly exaggerate the truth (46 percent of seniors over the age of 65 already use cell phones, according to the story), it still draws attention to the need to better bridge the generations in an era where technology sets the pace. Seniors shouldn’t be left to fend on their own.
FirstLight Home Care has always made it its mission to create a culture of care around its in-home care businesses. It’s the interpersonal connection we establish that keeps seniors connected to the cross sector of generations who attend to their needs. And while that certainly doesn’t require a calling plan, we welcome any initiative that allows the elderly to stay active and healthy so they can go the (long) distance in all of our lives."

311,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/former-firstlight-executive-opens-own-location-in-north-dallas/,"Our former director of business development and team support, Kevin Stewart, recently retired from his position to open a FirstLight location in Richardson, Tx. Stewart has spent the past two years working with us at the corporate level, helping to build this company from the ground up. A certified franchise executive (CFE) with a career in the franchising industry that spans over 25 years, Stewart is an immeasurable asset to FirstLight and has contributed substantially to the success and growth of the brand and our franchisees. Now that the shoe is on the other foot, Stewart will have the opportunity to put the knowledge and advice he was once offering other franchisees to the test.
After a long career on the corporate end of franchising that required constant travel and long hours away from home, Stewart wanted to settle down and have more time to spend with his family. He first entered the home care industry seven years ago after experiencing first-hand the need for quality caregivers when he and his wife provided care for his own mother throughout her battle with cancer. Having witnessed the FirstLight concept take off and gain momentum over the past two years and recognizing the increasing demand for in-home care, Stewart was confident that he wanted to remain in the industry.
This is a great testament on behalf of the FirstLight brand and although we’ll miss Stewart on the corporate side, we are excited to see his franchise location flourish in North Dallas!"
312,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/four-effective-ways-to-ask-for-help-for-seniors/,"Taking care of an elderly parent or a person with a chronic illness can become too much. You have your own family, job and responsibilities, and can easily become overwhelmed. Don’t be too proud to ask for help – from other family members, friends, people in your church or community organizations. You’ll be amazed at how many people volunteer and will love helping seniors!
- Help with Meals. Too often, seniors neglect their nutrition and eat poorly. This can result in weight loss or serve as a precursor to illnesses such as diabetes. Round up a group of people to provide meals for one day/week each. They can make the meals in advance and freeze them so all the senior has to do is pop them in the microwave!
- Help With Health. Many times, doctors, mobile dentists and podiatrists will visit seniors in their home at no extra cost. This makes it much easier for seniors
to get the healthcare they need without having to leave the convenience of their home.
- Help With Finances. Depending on their situation, your parents may be eligible for financial assistance. Start by contacting the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) (the federal agency responsible for Medicare) and SHIP – the State Health Insurance Counseling & Assistance Program, which provides counseling to families on Medicare or Medicaid. Also research other benefits available to veterans.
- Help With Transportation. Many times seniors can no longer drive. Check out the local transportation companies that provide deep discounts to seniors who need to get to doctor appointments or run errands. Many are able to accommodate wheelchairs.
The main thing to realize is you are not alone. There are many resources available to help you and seniors who want to stay at home. There are organizations such as ours — FirstLight Home Care — that provide in home caregivers on an hourly or 24/7 basis. We can bring peace of mind to families who are struggling to help seniors maintain their
independence.
If you have a question related to seniors, FirstLight Home Care’s own Nurse Gina is a valuable resource. She is both an RN and geriatric care manager who can help provide information on senior care."
313,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/four-tips-to-improve-senior-sleep/,"A 2013 survey by the Better Sleep Council discovered that 48 percent of Americans say they don’t get enough sleep, but less than half don’t take action to improve their sleep habits. A lack of sleep can be detrimental to one’s well-being, contributing to depression, skin aging, and weight gain. Improve senior sleep with these tips on how to get the best possible rest for outstanding senior living!
For older individuals, there’s a common misconception that sleep needs decline; research indicates that sleep needs stay relatively constant throughout adulthood. Because May is Better Sleep Month, here are four tips you and your loved ones can use to improve your sleep:
- Replace your mattress: An Oklahoma State University study discovered a new mattress can improve one’s sleep comfort levels by 70.8 percent, sleep quality by 62 percent, and back pain relief by 55 percent. Mattresses typically have a lifespan of five to seven years and excess sagging and wear can cause a number of adverse side effects to one’s health.
- Reserve the bedroom for sleep: If you watch TV or surf the web in your bedroom, your body may not have the cues to associate the room solely with sleep. Often referred to as stimulus control, reserving the bedroom for just sleep can help your body reinforce associating rest with the room instead of being in a passively awake state.
- Exercise: A sedentary lifestyle can contribute to sleep problems, especially in older adults. Low impact, aerobic exercise during the day and at least three hours before bedtime can help your body find a natural resting point and assist you in falling asleep easier and faster.
- Diet: How we eat and drink can affect our sleep patterns and more often than not, it’s not for the better. Making small changes to your diet, such as limiting caffeine late in the day, keeping liquid intake low before bedtime, and avoiding big meals with spicy foods before going to bed can help. It’s important to try and not go to bed hungry either, so try a light snack prior to your bedtime.
When you improve your sleep, you improve your health and longevity. For older Americans who are working with caregivers, healthy sleep habits are especially important, so if you or a loved one is struggling to get rest, there are a multitude of resources available to assist you. If you have a question about improving senior sleep or other topics related to caregiving, contact our “Just Ask FirstLight” service today."
314,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/free-or-cheap-family-holiday-traditions/,"During the holidays, it’s a great time to gather up the family and start a simple, yet heartwarming, Christmas tradition. We’ve pulled together a list of free (or cheap) indoor and outdoor activities that would make great family holiday traditions.
For our FirstLight Home Care caregivers, these are some of their favorite things to do with clients and families to bond and create lasting memories over the holidays. These 12-holiday traditions are designed to be fun for everyone (and that includes your wallet).
- Take a holiday light tour: Pile everyone into the car, put on some Christmas tunes, and go find the Clark Griswold-like light displays around your community.
- Go caroling: Everyone sounds great when caroling. Yes, we said everyone. Gather family, neighbors, residents in your senior living community and go caroling in your local neighborhood…or right inside a senior living facility. Add an ugly Christmas sweater contest to the caroling adventure to spice things up!
- Do some wreath making: Take a quick walk around the neighborhood and gather evergreen branches and pine cones. You could even trim some from the bottom of your Christmas tree or, if all else fails, buy some at the store. Attach your greens to a foam or wire ring (a bent metal coat hanger works well too) and decorate with ribbon, holiday flare, family photos, or whatever you fancy.
- Binge on Christmas movies: One of our favorite traditions! Put on your warm and cozy pajamas and spend an afternoon or evening watching your favorite Christmas movies. Make if fun for everyone by letting each family member choose their own favorite holiday movie to make it the ultimate movie fest.
- Spend time in the kitchen: What’s Christmas without some cookie baking? Spend the afternoon baking cookies and then hold a cookie swap! Invite family, friends, neighbors, or bring the treats to a local senior center and share the love.
- Volunteer: This is something you and your family can do all year long, but it seems the need is greater during the holidays. Volunteer at a local hospital, senior center, or serve meals in a local shelter to help those in need. Spending time with people who could use some holiday cheer is a great way to connect to those in your community and make your season brighter.
- Donate to a charity: Have your family help another family in need. Find a local Toys for Tots or Angel Tree in your community and host a toy drive. You could also gather up canned goods and donate to a local food bank.
- Check out local Christmas festivals: Throughout the holidays you will find lots of local Christmas festivals, markets, tree lightings, free holiday concerts and more around your community. Take advantage of any free activities.
- Take a holiday hike: Find a local trail near you and get outdoors on a clear and crisp winter day. Take time to stop, look around and enjoy the peace and quiet that you can find when hiking.
- Pen notes of appreciation: Gather everyone around the dining room table and write Christmas notes to family, friends or to our service men and women who will not home for the holidays. This is a great opportunity for you to give and say thanks to others who are important in your life. Your Christmas notes will be a welcomed surprise during a time when family is most important.
- Spend time with the elderly: Especially those who are homebound or in assisted living communities. Help an elderly neighbor with Christmas decorations, grocery shopping, yard maintenance — or simply spend some time with them talking and being a companion. This will mean more to them than you will ever know.
- Lend a helping hand: Look around at the people in your lives. Do you have a family caregiver that could use some respite care? Do you know stressed or tired parents who could use a date night? Give your time to help them out. It could be the best gift they receive all year.

315,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/fun-in-the-fall/,"Michael P. LaVell, the owner of FirstLight Home Care servicing greater Oakland County in Michigan, was featured on The ElderCompass Blog this week.
He shares some great tips for seniors to stay active in the fall. With Halloween in sight, here is his idea on how to stay sociable and active while celebrating the holiday.
“Halloween is creeping around the corner and so are the trimmings that go with it, including hunting for the perfect jack-o’-lantern at your local pumpkin patch. This is an enjoyable group activity that promotes socialization. Seniors can also take part in the festivities by painting pumpkins which offers a much more colorful and safer alternative to carving with sharp, hard to handle tools and knives. After, bake a fresh batch of pumpkin seeds, which can provide the ideal seasonal snack.”

316,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/fun-things-to-do-for-labor-day/,"So, it’s almost here. The official end of summer is marked by the long Labor Day weekend. What exactly are we celebrating on Labor Day? The name seems to be pretty self-descriptive, but often times it’s easy to not really think about what the holiday is really about. Let’s be honest, most of us are just grateful for a day off of work.
According to Wikipedia, Labor Day is an American federal holiday observed on the first Monday in September that celebrates the economic and social contributions of workers. Labor Day pays tribute to the contributions and achievements of American workers. It also symbolizes the end of summer for many Americans, and is celebrated with parties, parades and athletic events.
So with that formal definition provided, no onto the fun stuff and what Labor Day is allabout…relaxing with family and friends!
Below is a list of some fun things you can do in any city or town across the country, but make sure to also check out your local paper or do an online search for what’s happening (as NBC’s Al Roker says) “in your neck of the woods.” And in case of rain, don’t forget about all of those board games in the back of your closet! J A game of Scrabble or good old Yahtzee can be more fun than you remember.
- Grab a fold-up chair and find a prime spot at your local Labor Day parade
- Make a picnic and take it to your local park (or beach if you’re close enough)
- Find a local walking/bike path, and get some fresh air and little exercise
- Squeeze in some end-of-summer camping (with s’mores of course!)
- Hop on your bicycles and go for a leisurely spin
- BBQ in the backyard with family and friends
- Fix a big batch of homemade potato salad
- Drop a few tea bags in a big jar and set in the sun = delicious sun tea!
Whatever you decide to do this Labor Day, FirstLight Home Care wishes you all a very safe and relaxing weekend!"
317,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/funny-things-seniors-say/,"We are blessed to work around elderly people every day with our in-Home Care services at FirstLight Home Care. Some days are better than others when you care for someone who isn’t feeling well or who is struggling with the challenges that come with aging. Truthfully, many days are just plain hilarious. Old people say funny and do things. Many of them are jokesters and can’t wait for us to show up so that they can do something that will make us laugh.
We completely understand and appreciate HIPPA laws…but these are just too darn funny not to share. And, if it makes you feel better, we’ve changed the names of the people who said these things to protect the jokesters…we mean elderly.
- When making breakfast for a client one morning they asked: “Why is this butter so runny?” I turned, and responded “That’s because it’s honey.”
- Driving to a doctor appointment with my 91-year-old client, I asked him “What do you think is the best thing about being 91?” he replied “No peer pressure”.
- I do companion care for a young 89-year-old woman and she didn’t need me for a few days because she had her daughters, son-in-laws, grandchildren and great grandchildren coming in for a family event over the weekend. It was going to be a full weekend with lots of food, noise, kids running around, and everything a grandmother would love. When I returned on Monday she was sitting in her chair by the window looking a bit melancholy. I looked at her as I entered and asked “How was your weekend Mary?” She said: “I was diagnosed with A.A.A.D.D. this weekend.” I turned quickly to her and she said, “Age Activated Attention Deficit Disorder.” We both started laughing until tears were running down our faces.
If you found these comments funny like we did, share it with your friends. Or share your stories with us."
318,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/gaming-for-health-and-happiness/,"Last weekend, it was announced—again—that a senior citizen bowled a perfect score on Nintendo’s Wii Bowling. But if you’ve been following your video gaming news, you know that Rhea Freeman, 85, of Houma, La. isn’t the first senior to perfect the game!
Earlier this year, Dayton, Ohio resident Jack Davis, 86, announced that he had rolled 40 perfect games out of the 4,300 games attempted.
“I bowled when I was younger, but not like this,” Davis told his local paper. “If I bowled like this when I was league bowling in 1963, then I’d be a millionaire.”
Well, he’s not a millionaire but he sure is a local celebrity.
In addition to improving hand-eye coordination and problem solving skills, TIME magazine reported a few years back that Wii games can lead to weight loss and generate a positive psychological impact. In fact, research has even indicated that video games such as the ones played on Wii can be successfully used to treat seniors with Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and other illnesses of a psychological or psychosocial nature.
Sounds like the perfect winter work-out, right? So, what other games are ideal for seniors? Here’s a run-down:
Tetris: This classic game is available online and for almost every system. Having been around for ages, the puzzle game requires quick thinking and problem solving skills. But be careful: It’s addicting!
Brain Age: It’s a competitive, mental exercise game available in two editions that measures your brain age. Watch out, looks can be deceiving.
Dancing with the Stars: Can’t get enough of the show? Check out the game on Nintendo Wii. Great fun and exercise.
Sports Champions: Use your PlayStation Move motion controller as a paddle in table tennis or as a ball in a game of bocce. And when your grandchildren come over, they can go all out with a gladiator dual.
Grandparent games: This website uses games, videos, pictures and voice connection to connect elderly to grandchildren, starting with infants. They also have iPhone and IPod Touch apps."

As we start to reminisce of the events of this year (and read every year-in-review piece of information we can), we also start to get a little excited for January and the renewed optimism for change, for a better life, for a better you that comes with the arrival of a new year. This fresh start gives us a chance to reinvent our lives, ourselves, our homes, and our outlook. It allows us to reinvigorate ourselves, to shed the baggage of the previous year and do anything. Anything is possible!
This year it’s not about making a resolution that honestly last year we broke about 10 days into the New Year. It’s about reinventing the way we live.
Here are five things we’re doing to get ready for 2015 and we thought that we’d share with you:
One: Let go.
This is going to be a tough one. Many times we are held back by the tangled web of previous failures, commitments, emotions, and barriers. Change is hard and we tend to love to hold on to things (right). We tell ourselves that we cannot change careers because we’re used to what we’re doing and it’s too hard to change. We make it super easy on ourselves to not find time to get healthy and fit because we have all these other things to do. And, sad to say we cannot find time for our loved ones because we have too many commitments.
This is all old baggage. A fresh start demands a clean slate. Let everything from the past go (easier said than done, I know). Let go of the old ways to what you’ve been doing for the past year, or years. Let go of failures that creep into your head. Let go of fears you’ve built up. Let go of your ideas about what your life has to be like, because that’s the way it’s evolved so far. Let go of long-held beliefs and habits.
You have a fresh start. Let go of last year, and start anew.
Two: Dial in on what matters to you.
Do not focus on goals for an entire year; instead, just focus on today (because that is all you have….right now, this moment, this day). Identify the things you are most passionate about. Determine what you get the most fulfillment from. What excites you? Figure that out (because you already know what that is) and bring that forward in what you are thinking about today. It might be a project that takes you the entire year to complete, but make it a priority and allocate time and your energy to see it through.
Three: Clean out the distractions and get focused.
A Zen Master told us to “clear away email and Facebook and Twitter and your favorite blogs and news websites and social forums, clear away the iPhone or Blackberry or Android or cell phone, clear away all the little nagging work and chores and errands that pull at your attention, clear away the clutter that surrounds you (sweep it off to the side to deal with later). In fact, if you can, shut off the Internet for a while.” (Zen Habits 2010) Once you have removed the distraction, it will be easier for you to find focus. Start with 15 or 20 minutes at first and build up to 30-60 minutes each day. Focus on the thing that matters most.
Four: Be happy.
Don’t look at happiness as something that will come when you’re done with this goal, or when you’ve attained a certain accomplishment or certain amount of wealth or material goods. Don’t look at happiness as a destination, something that you’ll get later. Happiness is possible right now. When you learn to be happy now, it’ll always be here.
Five: Make every day January 1.
Consider 2015 your own Ground Hog Day (the movie). Every morning when you jump out of bed you have the chance to reinvent yourself. A chance to make a difference. A chance to do the things that are passionate about. A chance to be focused. To be happy."
322,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/gettin-g-a-senior-through-airport-security/,"Getting through airport security is without a doubt a hassle. There are the long lines that snake around the area as you inch forward with all your baggage. Then, when you finally get to the airport screeners, you have to take off your shoes, jewelry and coat, and remove your computer and liquids from your bag.
Extremely essential, but nonetheless, it can be exhausting!
In response to growing complaints, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has eased the rules for many seniors. Seniors over 75 no longer have to remove their shoes or outerwear. And if they trigger a metal detector, they will be allowed to pass through the detector a second time before being required to undergo a pat-down.
Here’s some additional tips from FirstLight Home Care to make the airport screening process as stress-free as possible for seniors:
- Wheelchairs. Because TSA has found some unauthorized items in wheelchairs and other mobility devices, TSA requires all people – whether they have a scooter, wheelchair, walker or cane – to be screened in some fashion. It’s best to call your departure and arrival airport in advance to verify their specific procedures. Can he/she walk or stand? What is their arm movement? All bags or satchels attached to mobility devices must be removed and placed on the X-ray belt for inspection.
- Hearing Aids or exterior cochlear implants do not need to be removed.
- Artificial Hips or Surgical Implants. It is best to advise security officers in advance of any implanted devices, because they will inevitably set off metal detectors. Security personnel may opt for alternative screening methods. Ideally, have your doctor provide a medical card explaining the location of the implanted
device.
- Pacemakers. Seniors who have a pacemaker may or may not set off a metal detector. It is best to carry your device identification card. You can be asked to be cleared with a hand-held screening wand held away from a pacemaker. Prior to going through security, explain to security personnel that you have a pacemaker in order to have special arrangements made. The metal detector will not cause any damage to the pacemaker. If you have an implantable defibrillator, ask for a hand search, because the hand-held wand can cause a shock.
- Oxygen. Oxygen and other respiratory devices have to be screened prior to going through a security checkpoint. If the oxygen cannot be disconnected, tell the security officer who can arrange for an alternate inspection process.
- Medications. Pills and liquid medications should be clearly labeled, and if the quantity is greater than 3.4 ounces, it must be separated from other carry-on items and declared to a security officer as a medical necessity. If you have diabetes and are carrying vials, syringes, epipens or insulin pumps, you must also notify security personnel.
The TSA has a hotline to answer questions about the security process for passengers with
disabilities and medical issues called TSA Cares. The toll-free number is 1
(855) 787-2227. Be sure to call 72 hours before traveling so you have enough
time to make any changes before going through security."
323,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/getting-involved-and-giving-back/,"Lately, I’ve been noticing a trend amongst seniors in the news—they’re giving back to their local communities and helping in out-of-the-box ways.
A group of pro-active seniors in Burlington, Wash., for example, are helping fight crime with the town’s new Citizens On Patrol program.
“So far our volunteers have already spotted a house that was broken into,” Officer Tim Van Dyken, community resource officer for Burlington police told NWCN.com this week.
The help from seniors is especially important as it comes at a time when budget cuts are the norm.
Another story that sparked my attention this week is one out of Chillicothe, Ohio. During the Pickaway-Ross Career and Technology Center’s Fall Senior Citizens Day, senior citizens helped students hone their skills. Cosmetology students cut and styled hair and offered pedicures and manicures while automotive technology students performed oil changes at a discounted rate, reported the Chillicothe Gazette.
Jeff Phillips, director of communications and community relations at the school, said the biannual event benefits both the students and seniors.

324,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/getting-parks-recreation-month/,"July is Parks and Recreation Month in the United States and this is a great time to help the seniors in your life be able to enjoy time in the great outdoors. In Detroit, Michigan this week, there are a hundreds of senior soldiers that are taking part in the National Veterans Golden Age Games, offering sports and recreational competitive events for Veterans 55 years of age and older. Although some of our seniors may not be able to always enjoy everything that time in the outdoors has to offer, the caregivers at FirstLight Home Care are pleased to be able to offer ideas on how to maximize the benefits of exercise during this month.
The National Institute on Aging offers a wide variety of programs and resources designed to help seniors get more exercise. As home care providers, we are familiar with the unique challenges that seniors can face in getting the right amount of exercise and offer the following tips for taking advantage of the benefits of Parks and Recreation Month.
- Walk in a Park: No matter what type of pace you can manage, being able to walk in a park is a great way for seniors to enjoy time outdoors. Speed is not as important as being able to walk in a park, which can lead to even longer walks as time goes on. Make sure that the seniors in your life have comfortable shoes, wear light clothing and stay hydrated during their outdoor walks to keep themselves comfortable.
- Bike or Boat: If your local community has bike trails or a boating area, enjoy time in the great outdoors during July by taking a leisurely bike ride or hit the water in a boat with the seniors in your life. If you are going for a bike ride, make sure that you ride at a pace that is comfortable for everyone, wear protective gear like a helmet and take breaks as needed. If you have a senior that doesn’t feel comfortable riding a bike, a boat ride while wearing a life vest can be a relaxing way to enjoy time outdoors!
- Relax in a Park: If the seniors in your life aren’t able to be as mobile as they would like, you can still take advantage of Parks and Recreation Month by taking a drive to a local park and enjoying time with others. Having social interactions with caregivers or family members can help seniors feel a part of a social group, so make a day of it! Take a light lunch, spread a blanket out and enjoy time together in the natural beauty of a local park.
No matter the level of activity that the seniors in your life are comfortable with, you can still enjoy time together and the beauty of the great outdoors during Parks and Recreation month. If you have a question about helping the seniors in your life get ready for a day in the park during July, or other topics related to caregiving, contact our “Just Ask FirstLight” service today for more information!"

327,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/gift-giving-ideas-for-your-elderly-parents-who-have-everything/,"If you’ve still have holiday shopping to do and a few people on your list that are difficult to buy for, don’t panic, we’ve put together a list of some great gifts ideas that might surprise the person who has everything.
- Tech-savvy gifts. If your parents enjoy technology, some electronic gift ideas include an e-reader loaded with a few good books. Or the iRobot Vacuum that cleans your floors every day with a push of a button. And finally, the Photo Cube – iPhone photo printer. This is a perfect gift for your parents who love to take photos of their kids (and grandkids) on their Smartphone but don’t have time to order prints.
- Dinner delivery service. Check out HelloFresh.com and purchase a month (or more) of meals delivered to their home. These fresh ingredients and healthy recipes will arrive at their doorstep each week.
- Year subscription to something they use, love, or enjoy. Living on a limited income may mean that they have to cut corners on things they enjoy. Giving them a year-long subscription to their local newspaper, or cable television, will help them throughout the year. Pay for lawn care or a cleaning service to help them with tasks that are becoming more difficult to do. Or, pay for their gym membership or quarterly wine club.
- Personal Coupon Book. If you live near your parents, give them the gift of you. Create a personal coupon book with coupons (5 to 12 activities) you can do together. Customize offers specific to what the person would enjoy – a free dinner out, an afternoon at the movies, or a day trip to the museum to view the latest exhibit. Keep the spirit of the season alive all year long. Both of you will appreciate this gift.
- Help at Home. Give your aging parents the gift of caring. A FirstLight Home Care Gift Certificate offers complete companion and personal care services for seniors, new mothers, those recovering from surgery, or anyone who just needs a little assistance.
Whatever you give this holiday season, giving the gift of being present is the best gift of all. Make a point to spend time with the ones you love. Put down your Smartphone and other electronic devices and be there to celebrate the holidays. Need more ideas? Check out our Facebook page where each week of December we’ll post other gift ideas for those in your life who already have everything!"
328,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/give-the-gift-of-caring/,"As Thanksgiving is around the corner and the holidays approach, the question always arises: “What should I get my parents and grandparents for the holidays?”
They are hard to buy for. They have reached the point in their life where they don’t need things. Dust collectors. Things to trip over and create a fall.
If you ask them what they want, they will undoubtedly answer: “nothing, I have what I need.” That’s not much of a help!
Consider this: your parents and grandparents are getting older and may have trouble doing the things they used to do. Cleaning the house may be troublesome. Meal preparation could be more than a chore, causing them to rely on fast food. Or, maybe they can’t get out and about to do their own holiday shopping.
That’s why at FirstLight Home Care, we suggest “giving the gift of caring.” Whether it’s for a few hours a day, once a week, or just a few times a month; our caregivers will help them take care of errands, trips to the doctor, meal preparation and more. We do so in the comfort of their home, where they are the most comfortable and familiar.
It’s hard for our aging parents to admit they need help, because this could result in a loss of independence. At FirstLight Home Care, we want to make sure they maintain their dignity and freedom, we respect their independence and encourage as much self-reliance as they are capable of safely doing.
Signs To Look For
Maybe you are a long distance caregiver and you will be seeing your Mom or Dad for the first time in a while over the holidays. If so, you may want to look for key signs that they may need a little help. In fact, that’s what adult children of aging parents need to do on a regular basis – watch for telltale signs that their parents’ health and lifestyle may be deteriorating.
Here are some signs to look for that indicate it may be time for a little help around the house:
- Difficulty with walking, balancing or mobility
- Mail piling up and past due bills
- Weight loss or weight gain
- Little or no food in the refrigerator; also spoiled or expired food
- Forgetting to take medicines or forgetfulness in general
- Vision or hearing issues
- A dirty or cluttered house with laundry piling up and dirty dishes in the sink
- Trouble standing from a seated position
- Dents or scratches on the car, indicating difficulty driving
- Sloppy appearance or poor hygiene
- Reluctance to leave the house or visit friends
If any of these indicators are in place, talk to your parents openly and honestly about getting some help. They may be resistant at first and you may have to get some reinforcement from doctors, family, or friends. Assure them that you have their best interests in mind and are concerned about their health and safety. Particularly assure them that you want to help them stay in their home as long as safely possible. Getting a little help today will keep them health and independent.
Remember, the best gifts don’t come from a store … they come from the heart!"
329,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/giving-thanks-to-the-family-caregiver/,"Today is Thanksgiving. A day to pause and give thanks to the people and blessings we have in our lives.
At FirstLight Home Care, we have much to be thankful for. We are most grateful for our amazing caregivers across the United States who are providing exceptional care and compassion to local families.
We are also thankful for the more than 40 million Americans who are family caregivers and will spend this Thanksgiving – like every day – placing the care and safety of a family loved one first. We thank them for their hard work, selflessness, dedication, and the ability to love unconditionally.
They are a true blessing.
We are inspired by the commitment family and professional caregivers give to help those who need additional support or who cannot care for themselves. The work you do and the care you provide is appreciated more than you will ever know.
Happy Thanksgiving."
330,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/go-red-for-american-heart-month/,"February is not only the month of love and affection but also American Heart Month with today being National Wear Red Day. The purpose is to create awareness for and fight against heart disease, which is the number one killer of women. Did you know that more women die of heart disease than all forms of cancer combined? As alarming as the statistics and numbers are, it proves that it is essential not only for women but also for men to take proper care of themselves and actively try to live a healthy lifestyle.
The American Heart Association offers great advice on their website on different ways to improve heart health as part of an overall healthy lifestyle. Here are a few notables:
• Nutrition is the number one way to fight against heart disease. Nutrients are vital and a well-balanced diet is the key to getting the proper amounts. Start making small changes in your diet and take steps to learn how to cook healthy recipes at home and make smarter choices when dining out with friends or family. Visit the AHA’s Nutrition Center online to find recipes and advice on smart shopping.
• Physical activity and weight management are also necessary for a healthy heart. Get moving! 30 minutes a day is all it takes to help reduce your risk of heart disease. As hard as it can be to get on the exercise bandwagon, you’ll feel better and your quality of life will improve. Be sure to talk to your doctor before starting any kind of exercise program. There are also plenty of low-impact options like yoga and water aerobics for people who may struggle with mobility issues.
• Quit smoking! This speaks for itself.
• LOL—literally. In many cases, laughter really is the best medicine so remember to do it! Stress management is key to reducing heart disease and healthy habits are another weapon that fights against stress. Stress affects everyone differently but everyone can agree it can be physically and emotionally debilitating. If you can’t laugh away some of your stress, you need to get to the root of the stress and focus on ways to cope with it or eliminate the source of it altogether.

331,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/good-reading-dad-has-dementia/,"Recently, we came across a great blog that every caregiver of aging parents should read. It’s called “Dad Has Dementia”, and it won a 2010 Online Journalism Award for Online Commentary/Blogging.
The blogger began writing when her dad was diagnosed with dementia, and she records the trials and tribulations her family has encountered along the way. Today she wrote,
“Five weeks after Dad died, Mom moved to New Mexico to be near me. Through serendipity and the kindness of a stranger, we were able to find her a patio home just four blocks from our house. I’m grateful for how things have worked out, because while Mom lives ‘independently,’ the truth is she needs help with everything but her activities of daily living. From bill paying to house cleaning, I’ll be doing it — so it’s nice that I can simply walk over to her place to help out.
The big questions now are: Where do we go from here? And what have I learned from my experience with Dad?”
It’s a touching story about a real family—and so many others across the country can relate. The writer Elizabeth Shean recently did an interview with the Second Act blog. You can read it HERE."
332,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/great-american-smokeout/,"If you are a smoker or you know, live, or care for someone that is, November 19th is a day you’ll want to lose the habit and become victorious over tobacco. The American Cancer Society Great American Smokeout® is November 19th and it’s your chance to triumph over this addiction. About 42 million Americans still smoke cigarettes, and tobacco use remains the single largest preventable cause of disease and premature death in the United States. As of 2014, there were also 12.4 million cigar smokers in the US, and over 2.3 million who smoke tobacco in pipes — other dangerous and addictive forms of tobacco. By quitting — even for one day — you will be taking an important step toward a healthier life — one that can lead to reducing your cancer risk. It’s a race for your health, and it starts today. November 19, 2015, can be the day that quitters win.
When a smoker quits smoking – what are the benefits over time? The American Cancer Society and US Surgeon General reports the following health benefits you will achieve:
- 20 minutes after quitting – Your heart rate and blood pressure drop (effect of smoking on arterial stiffness and pulse pressure amplification).
- 12 hours after quitting – The carbon monoxide level in your blood drops to normal.
- 2 weeks to 3 months after quitting – Your circulation improves and your lung function increases.
- 1 to 9 months after quitting – Coughing and shortness of breath decrease; cilia (tiny hair-like structures that move mucus out of the lungs) start to regain normal function in the lungs, increasing the ability to handle mucus, clean the lungs, and reduce the risk of infection.
- 1 year after quitting – The excess risk of coronary heart disease is half that of a continuing smoker.
- 5 years after quitting – Risk of cancer of the mouth, throat, esophagus, and bladder are cut in half. Cervical cancer risk falls to that of a non-smoker. Stroke risk can fall to that of a non-smoker after 2-5 years.
- 10 years after quitting – The risk of dying from lung cancer is about half that of a person who is still smoking. The risk of cancer of the larynx (voice box) and pancreas decreases.
- 15 years after quitting – The risk of coronary heart disease is that of a non-smoker’s.
Now isn’t it time you quit? Learn more about The American Cancer Society’s Great American Smokeout® and how it can change your life (for the better)."
333,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/growing-old-common-pains-when-youre-in-your-60s-and-70s/,"As we age, the wear and tear on our bodies bring on different pains. In our 60s and 70s, many of us can anticipate something hurting, but there are ways to manage our body’s changes and reduce the level of pain produced by certain elderly conditions.
Osteoarthritis tends to be one change those over 60 experience. This is the “wear and tear” type of arthritis that comes from using your joints over and over. More than 27 million Americans 65 and older have it. It’s the most common type of arthritis out of more than 100 different types.
Keep Moving
To reduce pain and feel better, you need to get moving and keep your weight in check. An active lifestyle helps. Just pick activities that are easy on your joints – like swimming. When you are in your 60s and 70s, a stationary lifestyle is riskier than the risk of a physical injury.
- Choose an exercise program that includes weight training for muscles and bones and aerobic activity for heart health.
- Slow, gentle stretching can improve flexibility and help with stiffness. Strength exercises lessen pain by easing the burden on joints.
- Try to stick to a healthy weight. It will keep extra stress off your joints so you feel better. If you’re not sure what weight is best for you, ask your doctor.
- Over-the-counter medication may help with pain and inflammation. Check with your doctor first if you take other medicines or have other medical problems. Your doctor may also be able to prescribe something to help.
Growing old doesn’t have to be painful. Simple exercises or activities can help you keep your body moving, which will help you feel better.
As always, check with your primary care physician before starting any exercise program."
334,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/halloween-safety-tips-for-seniors/,"Halloween is a fun holiday for kids and adults. But for elderly loved ones, it can be stressful and a little unsettling, especially if they live alone.
Older adults should feel safe and secure on Halloween, whether they hand out candy or not. These six Halloween safety tips for seniors can help family caregivers ensure their loved ones enjoy the holiday no matter what, while also providing peace of mind to family members.
- Make sure the house is well lit. Whether you’re loved one is going to be away from the house on Halloween or at home handing out treats, make sure their porch light is working and the exterior and interior of the home is brightly lit.
- Look outside before opening the door. Even though it’s Halloween, always check to see who is standing outside before answering the door. If it’s a group of unruly teens or a lone adult, keep the door closed as a safety precaution.
- Keep all visitors outside. Encourage your senior to stay inside when passing out candy and to not allow strangers into the home for any reason. You can also place a bowl of candy on the front porch rather than handing it out. Include a sign that says: “Happy Halloween! One per person, please.”
- Keep steps and walkways clear. Keep all walkways and steps clear of flame-lit jack-o-lanterns, oversized decorations and other décor. Removing items that pose tripping hazards will not only help keep aging loved ones safe, but also the children coming to the door whose vision may be impaired by a mask.
- Keep your loved one company. Instead of having your elderly loved one hand out Halloween candy alone, join them! This is especially important if they are living with dementia or physical limitations. It will make everyone feel more comfortable, and they’ll be safe throughout the night! If you can’t be there, we can. Our Companion Care Services provide companionship for a few hours, or even overnight. We can help distribute Halloween candy and, in between trick-or-treaters, we can share a conversation, play games or watch their favorite TV shows.
- Remember costume safety: If an elderly adult is dressing up in a costume, it shouldn’t be restrictive or something that could cause them to trip. Masks and other accessories that can block vision are also a bad idea for seniors that may already struggle with poor eyesight.
Halloween is a spooktacular night for people of all ages. But with these Halloween safety tips for seniors, you can help your aging loved one stay safe and enjoy all the fun. If you have children, read these simple steps for an extra safe Halloween.

Good news to share as we kick off the New Year: Tammy Iuso, recent Franchisee of the Year and owner of FirstLight in Orlando has earned Joint Commission Accreditation. This is quite an accomplishment in the home care industry and Orlando is our first location to earn this accreditation.
The Joint Commission is an independent, non-profit organization that accredits and certifies more than 19,000 health care organizations and programs in the United States. This is widely recognized as a symbol of quality that reflects an organization’s commitment to meeting specific performance standards.
Through this long process, the benefits of accreditation include a proven commitment to the highest level of patient care, encouraging patient referrals, nationally acknowledged benchmark of quality, increasing competitive edge, access to organization-specific services, and an enhanced ability to attract and recruit top-quality staff.
Various performance standards are addressed by the Joint Commission, in conjunction with health care experts, providers and researchers. Among the top 2011 standards-based performance areas for home care organizations are things like emergency management, environment of care, leadership, medication management, human resources, life safety, performance improvement and waived testing.
This is a great start to a new year and we’re so proud of Tammy for her accomplishments. Hoping this is a sign of good things to come. Best wishes for 2012!"

- We give thanks to the amazing doctors, nurses, and frontline personnel who have been working tirelessly to care for those with COVID-19.
- We give thanks to all the people who work in essential services. The men and women who continue to stock the shelves, deliver the mail, fill our prescriptions, pick up our trash, care for the elderly, and keep our country safe.
- We give thanks to the parents who have stepped in and up to become the teacher, the guidance counselor, the principal and so much more to help further their child’s education.
- We give thanks to the small businesses that have reinvented themselves and taken good care of their customers. We pray they will come out of this stronger and better.
- We give thanks to the local restaurants that have had to pivot into a new era of curbside, delivery, and contactless meal options.
- We give thanks to Zoom and the other video services that allow us to stay connected with family, friends, co-workers, and clients.

344,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/have-you-had-the-talk-over-50-and-dating/,"If you’re over 50 and single, dating might sound a little daunting. But the good news is that you can date (because there are millions of people 50 and older who are single in the US) and when you do start to date, you can build a relationship how you want. What we’ve learned about the 50 and older crowd is that a large percentage of them have already been married so they know more about what they want (or better yet, what they don’t want). So if you’re just getting out into the dating scene after a few years, you need to know that times have changed and dating is definitely not like how it was when you were in your 20’s!
If you are going to start dating in 2016, here are 4 things you need to know:
- Dating after 50 could mean that the person sitting across the restaurant table has more baggage in the form of financial issues, emotional issues, and/or are still raising or putting their children through college. Make sure you understand where the person is at in all aspects of their life and if they’re bringing with them an overnight bag of issues or hauling in a semi-truck full of problems. If it’s the latter, you may want to just split the tab and head home.
- Online dating has become increasingly popular over the years, with singles of all ages. If you do decide to explore online dating, be safe, especially when giving out personal information or meeting someone. If you’re going on a date, always tell someone else where you are going.
- Slow down the dating process. Just because you’re over 50 doesn’t mean you have to speed up the relationship process and hurry to the altar because you don’t want to be alone. Take your time to get to know those men or women who most interest you. Over time people will reveal all their life story once you have both built trust with each other.
- Before things get serious, be forthright in knowing everything about the other person. Dating is personal and you need to know everything. Ask questions about their finances, past relationships, family and health issues and everything in between. The more personal your conversations are early in the dating the process, the sooner you will know what you’re getting into – and if that is something you can handle.
Do you have any advice you’d give the 50 and older crowd on dating? Share your thoughts and suggestions below."
345,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/health-benefits-of-gardening-for-seniors/,"Getting your hands dirty in the garden is the first step toward cleaner living. Gardening allows you to create beauty while enjoying the benefits of fresh air. Unlike some activities, such as walking on a treadmill, gardening gets seniors outside. It also offers tangible rewards in the form of gorgeous blossoms or tasty food. That’s just the beginning when it comes to the health benefits of gardening for seniors.
Exercise
Gardening can help you stay active at any age. It’s considered a moderate activity and it can burn about 300 calories an hour. Plus, the movement of planting and tending a garden helps with muscle strength, mobility and flexibility. The beauty of gardening is that it may not even feel like exercise. This means you’re getting a workout while engaging in an activity you enjoy.
Get Vitamin D
You can get your daily dose of vitamin D, the “sunshine vitamin,” by spending time in the sun. Vitamin D helps with bone strength and it boosts your immune system. Be sure to protect yourself from the sun’s harmful rays with sunscreen, protective clothing and a hat.
Lift Your Spirits
Fresh air and sunshine can brighten your mood, and gardening provides these in spades. Studies have shown that gardening helps reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. Researchers have also learned the mycobacterium vaccae found in soil increases your brain’s production of serotonin, the “happy hormone.” Turns out dirty hands mean a happy brain! Gardening provides a connection with nature that can be harder to achieve as we age. This connection helps us relax and improve our mood.
Grow Healthy Food
Growing food can be another health benefit of gardening for seniors. Enjoy the fruits (or veggies) of your labor by planting edible crops. You get the benefit of healthy food that tastes so much better than what you buy at the grocery store. Tomatoes, squash and green beans are good starter plants for novice gardeners.
Strawberries need little effort to produce their tasty fruit. Blueberries can grow in small spaces and provide a bunch of health benefits for seniors. This small fruit contains iron, phosphorous, magnesium, zinc and calcium to help keep bones strong. The antioxidants also help lower blood pressure, prevent cancer, and protect you from heart disease.
Sense of Purpose
We often struggle with feeling productive as we age. Gardening can help with this by providing tasks to complete. It’s enormously gratifying to nurture seeds (or seedlings) into beautiful flowers or plants. If you’re growing edible crops, producing your own food provides a sense of self-reliance. You can keep family and social connections strong by involving kids or grandkids, caregivers and friends.
If your loved one wants to get started with gardening or continue a years-long passion, keep a few things in mind to make it easier.
- Try raised beds or potted plants to reduce the amount of stooping and squatting.
- Replace heavy tools with lighter, ergonomic models that are easier to operate.
- Seating is also helpful. Your loved one may need to rest more often, and it might be easier to do some of the tending while sitting down.
Gardening is an activity that grows on you. It’s also an activity that creates beauty and a sense of accomplishment, and these may be the biggest benefits of all.

346,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/health-benefits-of-pets-for-seniors/,"Many family caregivers know that the seniors they care for can sometimes experience loneliness and depression, which can cause long-term physical health issues. But did you know that therapy for this sense of isolation might just be found at the nearest animal shelter or pet store?
Americans love their pets! Recent surveys show that two out of every three American homes have a pet, and that number has risen 20% over the past 30 years.
Medical studies prove that the health benefits of pets for seniors and the outpouring of affection for our furry friends are real and lasting. Here are some of the benefits:
- Improvement in mental health: A 2020 study by the Cleveland Clinic reports that pets elevate moods, decrease depression and slow the impact of dementia in seniors because they provide companionship, a source of entertainment and a sense of purpose. Socialization with a pet also lowers stress hormones and increases stabilizing hormones like serotonin.
- Increase in heart health: Because pets require both physical and emotional care, older adults who own a pet tend to be more active. This results in a reduction in cardiovascular disease.
- Better quality of life: When seniors have an animal to keep healthy, they tend to keep themselves healthier in order to care for their pets. Reports have shown that seniors with pets require fewer doctors visits, have a lower body mass and voluntarily exercise more often. Pets can also improve a senior’s outlook on life.
- A longer lifespan: According to a report from the American Heart Association, people who own dogs live 24% longer than those who do not. As mentioned above, owning a dog encourages more physical activity, which can decrease disease and illness. But the study also suggests that simply petting a dog or cat can reduce stress and improve blood pressure.
- Pets ease the pain: A 2012 study in Pain Magazine found that pets provide a reduction in pain and emotional distress for chronic pain patients. The study also noted that dogs significantly improve emotional distress and feelings of well-being in family and friends who accompany these patients.
- Security: While statistics have shown for years that burglars will resist a home with a barking dog, pets also offer seniors a sense of emotional security.
Caregivers should note, however, that picking a pet for their loved one is not without challenges. There are several things to assess before making a decision:
- How much help your loved one can provide in caring for the pet
- How much additional work caring for a pet could create for the family caregiver
- How to match the pet’s temperament with your loved one’s personality
- The age of the pet and what is best suited for the household
- Finances. Pet care can be expensive, and many seniors are on fixed budgets.
- Finally, consider where to adopt or purchase a pet. Municipal and not-for-profit animal rescue shelters top the list. Some of these shelters have free or reduced-price programs for seniors looking to adopt that include the fees for spaying or neutering the pet. Pets can also be purchased at local pet stores, but the cost of spaying or neutering the animal is additional and may not fit your senior’s budget.
While there are many challenges to think about when considering adopting a pet for your loved one, there is overwhelming evidence of the health benefits of pets for seniors.

347,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/health-concerns-in-aging-parents/,"As your parents age, it is important they receive proper care, especially if there are health concerns. We all know this is easier said than done since many aging adults hate
to admit their health is fading. However, there is nothing more dangerous than an elderly parent living on their own and unable to care for themselves. When visiting and speaking to your parent(s), make sure to look for tall-tale signs of health problems. Listed, are five obvious signs of distress that may require medical attention or assistance for your parent.
Note, that there may be other signs not listed, so it is always important to seek medical advice if you see anything of concern.
- Memory Loss.This is one of the most common signs of Alzheimer’s as well as other dimension type issues related to aging. Keep an eye on if your parent(s) is starting to forget simple daily tasks or normal daily routines. Notice if they begin to ask more questions, especially if asked the same question multiple times.
- Weight Loss.This is a sign of a health problem for all ages and can be seen quite drastically in aging adults. It could be a sign of your parent not able to follow a necessary healthy diet, or it could mean an underlying health issue that causes one to lose weight.
- Feeling Down.Ask yourself…. Are your parents in good spirits? If they seem to be depressed or not feeling “up to it”, this may be a simple sign that they hate getting old, or it could mean much worse. Depression is difficult for the aging and should be monitored by health professionals.
- Trouble Getting Around.Is your parent walking slower or even limping? Are they having a hard time getting from one place to the next? We all know everyone unfortunately slows down as they age, but make sure it isn’t to an extreme, where there may be something else going on.
- Safety Concerns.Take a look around your parent’s home. Make sure the houseis being kept safe, and if they are forgetting or unable to do necessary safety instructions for the house. For example, leaving the stove on, forgetting to lock the door, not picking up broken glass, etc. Any of the above signs can be a sign for health concerns and can also lead to unsafe living conditions…. which in turn is a sign in itself.
The aging process is difficult for everyone, but it can be much easier if we know we are not in it alone. Be aware of the issues and signs related to aging, and make sure to give
your parents the proper assistance they need. If you do see signs of health problems, seek local medical professionals as well as look into assisted living centers for your parent(s)."
348,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/health-foot-care-and-the-right-pair-of-shoes/,"Be kind to your feet. As we age, the years of wear and tear can be hard on them. Disease, bad circulation, poorly trimmed toenails, and wearing shoes that don’t fit can also harm your feet. Nurse Gina has discussed many times within the FirstLight Home Care family that foot problems are sometimes the first sign of more serious medical conditions such as arthritis, diabetes, and nerve or circulatory disorders. Her recommendations…. practice good foot care.
The National Institute on Aging recommends that you look at your feet often; use a mirror to look at the bottoms of your feet. Look for cuts, blisters, and ingrown toenails. They also suggested that you put your feet up when you are sitting down. This helps the circulation in your feet. So can stretching, walking, or having a gentle foot massage. If you have a problem with your feet, your family doctor can help, or visit a podiatrist.
One way to help your feet is by wearing comfortable shoes. We know you don’t want to hear this as you get older and have to wear boring shoes like your grandma use to wear, but the better the shoe fits and feels on your foot, the better you will feel. Shoes that fit well can prevent many foot problems. Here are some tips for making sure your shoes fit:
- Shoe size may change as you age, so always have your feet measured before buying shoes. The best time to measure your feet is at the end of the day when your feet are the largest.
- Most of us have one foot that is larger than the other. Make sure your shoes fit your larger foot.
- Don’t buy shoes without trying them on first. Shoe sizes can vary depending on the kind, make, and style. For example, the size you wear for sneakers may not be the same size you need for dress shoes.
- Walk in the shoes to make sure they feel right. The heel of the shoe should not slide up and down when you walk.
- Choose a shoe that is shaped like your foot. Styles with high heels or pointed toes can hurt your feet.
- Stand up when trying on shoes to make sure there is about 1/2 inch between your toe and the end of the shoe.
- Make sure the ball of your foot fits comfortably into the widest part of the shoe.
- Don’t buy shoes that feel too tight and hope they will stretch.
- The upper part of the shoes should be made of a soft, flexible material.
- Soles should give solid footing and not slip. Thick soles cushion your feet when walking on hard surfaces.
- Low-heeled shoes are more comfortable, safer, and less damaging than high-heeled shoes.
If you have questions about foot care, please reach out and ask our own Nurse Gina.

349,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/health-teeth-aging/,"Did you know that your teeth age? As we age, so do our mouths. Even if you take excellent care of them, your teeth, gums and jawbone will change as you get older. The medicines we take can negatively impact your oral health which is why our Nurse Gina recommends you visit your dentist two times a year for cleaning and X-rays. Prevention is the key!
As we grow older, the changes going on inside our mouth could include:
Tooth Changes: Chewing, grinding and normal life will cause your teeth to wear down over time. People who clench or grind their teeth may have more wear on their teeth than other people.
You may notice that your teeth look darker as you age. That’s because aging dentin (the tooth’s middle layer) gets thicker and darker. At the same time, tooth enamel thins, allowing more of the darker dentin color to show through. Staining from foods, wine, coffee, tea and tobacco also discolor teeth.
Many older people have more plaque buildup on their teeth. This may not be because of their age. It can be related to physical changes that can make it more difficult to brush and floss every day. For example, people may not be able to clean their teeth as well with arthritis or after a stroke. Or they may simply forget to do it.
Gum Changes: As you get older, your gums recede from the teeth and your jaw bone shrinks. These are moderate changes. Age alone does not lead to a major loss of the structures that support your teeth. If the roots are exposed, your teeth can become sensitive. Fluoride rinses can decrease this sensitivity. They also can help to prevent decay on the crowns and exposed roots of teeth.
Mouth Changes: Many oral changes are not caused by aging. Rather, they are side effects of medicines or other diseases. For example, many drugs and some diseases of the body cause changes in the way things taste. Taste changes can lead to nutritional problems. If food becomes less attractive, people may not eat a balanced diet.
Dry mouth is very common in older people. It is usually a side effect of medicine. Hundreds of medicines can cause dry mouth. Saliva normally washes away bits of food and bacteria and helps keep your mouth clean. If you have a dry mouth, the bacteria and food will stay around longer. This means they are more likely to cause decay. Over-the-counter fluoride rinses can help protect your teeth from decay. You can moisten your mouth using artificial saliva. Other options are to drink more water or suck on sugarless lemon drops.
If you have aging parents, you may want to check to see when their last visit to the dentist was and if they are having any issues with their mouth. FirstLight Home Care’s Personal Care Services work with family members on oral hygiene. Our caregivers can help our clients with mouth, gum, and denture care to encourage better overall oral hygiene.

350,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/health-tips-to-stay-cool-during-a-heat-wave/,"It’s August and that means it’s hot outside. Heat waves are hitting the U.S. hard and temperatures are soaring. For many people – especially our senior population – they do not have air conditioning. If you know someone in your neighborhood who does not have air conditioning and is struggling to keep cool, here are some tips for surviving a heat wave that you can share with them.
- Purchase a fan. Box fans and ceiling fans can promote air circulation throughout the home. Opening doors in the house and using box fans to push hot air outdoors can function as an “exhaust” system and draw cooler evening air into the house.
- Cool down with water. Fill buckets or basins and soak your feet. Wet towels and bandanas can have a cooling effect when worn on the shoulders or head. Take cool showers or baths. Use a spray bottle filled with cold water and spray on you throughout the day.
- Head to the basement. Heat rises. If the home has a basement, head down there. It can be a cool refuge from the midday heat.
- Stay hydrated. Consume more water than usual when it is hot. Drink sufficient amounts of fluids before you feel thirsty in order to prevent hydration.
- Get outside. During the hottest hours of the day, head outside to a public building with air conditioning. Check out the library, shopping center or movie theaters to stay out of the heat and bring some much-welcomed relief.
Remember that heat-related illnesses can turn into serious emergencies. Be a good neighbor and make sure that as the heat rises, you’re checking in on elderly neighbors. Heat cramps, heat rashes, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke can be the result of someone not able to cool themselves down. If this is happening to your elderly neighbor, you should call emergency services (911) and try to cool them down until help arrives."
351,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/healthcare-extended-families/,"With so much debate going on right now over Obamacare and extending health insurance benefits to same sex couples, it raises the question: when are healthcare benefits going to be offered to extended families?
“With so many parents living with their children in their senior years, the idea of a ‘nuclear family’ has changed with many generations living under one roof,” says Jeff Bevis, CEO of FirstLight Home Care. “In the future, I hope we will see employers of the ‘sandwich generation’ extending healthcare benefits to more than just spouses and children.”
Right now the only option for adult son and daughters to take care of sick or aging parents is to rely on federal programs like Medicaid and Medicare, private insurance, veteran’s benefits, or pay out of pocket. This can get extremely expensive for children who have their own financial obligations.
According to the Pew Research Center, nearly half of adults in their 40s and 50s have a parent who is over the age of 65 and are either raising a young child or financially supporting a child 18 or older. About 1 in 7 middle-aged adults are providing financial support to both an aging parent and a child. This can put a squeeze on the family budget.
What Innovative Companies Will Lead The Charge?
As the job market starts to heat up and employers are looking for ways to stand out from their competition, one novel idea might be to offer health insurance coverage to extended families.
What Companies Will Be on the Leading Edge?
A recent survey by Grand Rounds discovered that 60% of U.S. employees with parents feel expanding healthcare benefits to extended families is “somewhat important” while 68% report they would be more likely to choose an employer based on which one offered extended benefits if multiple offers were available.
Northern Kentucky University already offers this benefit and many other universities and companies may soon be following suit.
Shopping Private Health Insurance
If you’re looking for a plan that offers health insurance to extended families, here’s some tips from HealthInsuranceQuotes.com.
- Talk to an insurance agent. Shopping online is not the way to go if you are trying to cover an extended family that may include parents, aunts, uncles, etc. These online software systems are not set up for ‘nuclear families.”
- See if there are any discounts for extended families. If an insurance company sees an extended family as one unit, there may be some discounts for volume. For instance, a discounted drug plan may be available.
- Insurance companies are becoming more in tune to the needs of extended families. With a little research, you can find plans that can reduce your medical costs dramatically.
At FirstLight Home Care, we’d love to know your feelings: do you feel healthcare should be offered for extended families?"
352,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/healthy-aging-what-can-you-control/,"Most people have a gradual decline as they age, but it doesn’t mean you can’t fight it. There are a few things you can do to control how you age to make sure you make the most of your later years. Here are a few ways you can control how you age.
Exercise: Add a daily exercise regime to your day. Take a walk, go to the gym, take senior exercise classes and stick with it. Exercising will make you feel better, help you control your weight, improve your mental alertness, and get you engaged with other people.
Portion Control: Eat smart. Don’t over eat. Being overweight can lead to obesity which can lead to diabetes. The heavier you become, the more likely you will increase a sedentary lifestyle which will lead to a shorter lifespan.
Immunizations: Avoid getting sick by keeping up to date with your immunizations. See your doctor annually (or as necessary) and know what is going on inside of you. Understand your potential risk factors and have them assessed before you have problems.
Challenge your Brain: Read the newspaper or books. Build a puzzle, complete a Sudoku puzzle or play a game. Keeping your mind engaged could ward off the brain changes that lead to Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia.
There is no reason you cannot look and act decades younger than your age by just make a few simple changes to your life today. If you have any questions about what you can do to age gracefully, ask our Nurse Gina."
353,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/healthy-eating-for-seniors-on-a-budget/,"When your monthly financial budget is tight, meal planning and grocery shopping can be challenging. For many seniors who are on a fixed income and need to watch their overall expenses, eating healthy on a set budget can be tricky.
Here are 9 great tips to help you or your aging loved one eat well and stay on budget:
Plan Meals Around Store Sales: Many times, healthier food options cost more. If your local grocery store offers a savings or loyalty card, be sure to sign up and check the weekly circular to see what’s on sale. Instead of shopping for groceries based on your weekly meal plan, consider planning your meals around what’s on sale.
Make a Grocery Game Plan: Making a grocery list before heading to the store can help you stay organized, save money (and time), and choose more nutritious options.
Cut or Download Coupons: Use paper and digital coupons on the things you buy most to help you save money. If you see coupons for items that rarely go on sale, consider buying those items even if you don’t need them right away.
Check Out Store Brands: Typically, a grocery store brand cost less. These products are made under a special label, sometimes with the store name. You might have to look on shelves that are higher or lower than eye level to find them. And these often taste just as good as the name brand!
Buy in Bulk: Of course, only buy what you can use before it goes bad, but if you buy meats or seasonal fruits and veggies in bulk, freeze them. Freeze what you’re not going to use immediately into portion-sized packages and thaw as you need them.
Buy Economical Produce: Bananas, apples, oranges, cabbage, sweet potatoes, dark-green leafy vegetables, green peppers, and regular carrots are typically the most inexpensive fruits and veggies at your local market. Fresh fruits and veggies also are nonprocessed, healthy options.
Incorporate Variety: Consuming a variety of foods will ensure you’re getting all the nutrients you need. According to the National Council on Aging, a healthy meal should consist of a lean protein, fruits and vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy.
Remember Your Liquids: As you age, your sense of thirst can decrease. To combat this, MyPlate, a healthy eating initiative by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, suggests drinking plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated even if you don’t feel thirsty. Water is best, but fat-free milk and 100-percent juice are other nutritious options.
Consider Outside Support: Some seniors fail to get adequate nutrition simply because they don’t want to bother with grocery shopping, preparing a meal and cleaning up afterward. Hiring an in-home companion caregiver can assist you or your aging loved one with grocery shopping, preparing regular meals that maintain a healthy diet and provide sufficient nutrition, and by simply adding joy and comfort to one’s day.

354,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/healthy-eating-for-seniors/,"Healthy eating for seniors is an important part of their overall health and well-being. Eating a well-balanced diet is critical as they age. Proper nutrition provides the necessary vitamins, minerals and other nutrients, and it can help maintain a healthy weight. Eating right can also lower the risk of developing chronic health conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes.
Also keep in mind that as your parent, grandparent or other senior loved one gets older, their nutritional needs, diet and appetite may change. For example, they may need fewer calories because of a slower metabolism. They may experience a loss of appetite because their sense of taste and smell diminish. Or they may need to modify their diet due to a chronic health problem or because of a certain medication they are taking.

356,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/heart-healthy/,"It’s no coincidence that Valentine’s Day and the American Heart Month are both in February. Both want your heart to be healthy – just in different ways.
The bad news is that Americans suffer 1.5 million heart attacks and strokes each year. The good news is that many of the factors that put you at risk can be controlled. We’re not talking age, gender, race or heredity. We’re talking about lifestyle and diet changes that can severely cut down your risk.
For instance, when was the last time you tested your blood pressure? According to the Center for Disease Control, more than 67 million Americans have high blood pressure. Don’t have a blood pressure monitor? Many grocery stores and pharmacies have a machine where you can take your blood pressure for free. If not, you can pick up a small blood pressure monitor at many pharmacies fairly inexpensively.
Who is at Risk?
Don’t think that heart disease is an illness that only attacks those 65+. About 150,000 people who died from cardiovascular disease in 2009 were younger than age 65. Other factors can increase your risk:
- Obesity
- Depression
- African men are 30% more likely to die from heart disease than were non-Hispanic white men.
- More women tend to die from heart disease than men.
- Low income
- A family history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes

There are some obvious ways to lower your blood pressure, but some of these may come as a surprise to you:
- Stop smoking or using tobacco products.
- Limit your alcohol intake to one drink for females, two drinks/day for males.
- Exercise for at least 30 minutes every day, even if it’s a slow walk.
- Don’t follow any quick weight loss diets. There are two diets proven to be heart healthy — the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan and the Mediterranean diet. These diets are high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and certain types of fish (salmon and mackerel). It’s important to choose foods that have less salt.
- Test your blood pressure daily and take your blood pressure medicine.
Understand that high blood pressure can be controlled. Take small steps towards managing this condition.

357,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/hello-retirement/,"As most of you know, the first wave of the 79 million Baby Boomers in America, are entering retirement this year. What can this generation expect as they begin the transition into their “Golden Years?” Surprisingly, a whole new world of money-saving benefits and opportunities are available. From life and health, finances, travel and transportation to entertainment and leisure activities, senior citizens and soon-to-be retirees are eligible for perks that affect almost every area of their lives. Here are five discounts to start taking advantage of:
1. Auto-insurance: Many companies provide incentives if seniors take a safe-driving course. AARP’s Driver Safety Program and the 55 Alive program both qualify seniors for insurance discounts in participating states after completing an accident prevention course.
2. Health Care: Check out HealthAtoZ or RxAssist to find information about saving on prescription drugs, dental and vision care and health insurance. Remember there are other sources of reduced cost/free health care available other than Medicare. The key is to search around and research all of your options!
3. Travel: Airlines, hotels and rental car agencies are all catering to the ever expanding senior demographic. Besides honoring AARP cards, many companies give discounts based on age qualifications alone. Amtrak and Greyhound offer discounts ranging from 5-15 percent while rental car company Dollar’s Silver Dollar Club gives people age 50 and over up to 10 percent off. Many airlines offer special senior fare rates that are only available by calling the airline directly.
4. Fun & Games: Restaurants, movie theaters, museums, theme parks, and sports activities offer many senior discounts. Your local senior center or chamber of commerce should be able to help you locate special deals in your area. Wherever you go, make sure to inquire about the senior discount.
5. Enrichment Classes: With more time on your hands after retirement, consider signing up for a free or low cost program in your community. Local community colleges or senior centers often offer classes in the arts, wellness, technology and volunteer services for older adults. For example, OASIS is a national nonprofit organization focused on creating opportunities for adults to continue personal growth and a chance to give back to their community. See if there is an OASIS city near you.
Overall, there are substantial savings to be found specifically tailored to seniors’ and retirees’ interests and hobbies. The best way to find these perks and rewards is to simply ask."
358,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/help-seniors-enjoy-holidays/,"There are simple ways you can support an aging loved one you know and help seniors enjoy the holidays a little more this year.
For most, the holidays bring feelings of joy, anticipation and excitement. Spending time with friends and family, attending holiday gatherings and exchanging gifts all symbolize the season of goodwill. However, not all people experience happiness during the holiday season.
Close to 12 million seniors live alone. And many often struggle with grief over the loss of a loved one, sadness, confusion and isolation, especially if they don’t have family close by. This can bring on the holiday blues and make it difficult for seniors to enjoy this time of year. Let’s help seniors enjoy the holidays!
Whether it’s an aging parent, friend or neighbor, there are simple ways you can help seniors enjoy the holiday a little more this year.
Be a companion. Make it a point to visit and spend time with a senior loved one. Participate in an activity they love, play their favorite game or simply ask them about their life. Storytelling and memory sharing is a great way to lift a senior’s spirit and can be very important to the aging process. Let your elderly loved one share stories and explore memories by looking at old pictures, letters and newspaper articles and by listening to music. Remember to also be thoughtful. If your loved one has experienced memory loss, it can be difficult and frustrating when you are telling stories or recalling events from the past.
You also can help set up Skype or Facetime so that they can visit with out-of-town family members and friends. Our Companion Care Services can assist those who may not have family nearby and help seniors enjoy the holidays a little more.
Be a chef. Prepare one of their favorite holiday meals and then stay to visit and enjoy the meal with them. This can be a great way to connect with your loved one. Also, consider inviting them to cook with you and have fun making a favorite family holiday recipe together. Check out these holiday recipe ideas for inspiration on creating new holiday food traditions.
Be a home helper. It can be difficult for seniors to do housework, especially if they have mobility issues or other physical limitations. Helping them around the house by cleaning, de-cluttering and picking up anything on the floor that could be a tripping hazard can ensure the senior’s home is safe. Don’t forget the outside of the home as well. Raking leaves, doing yard work and getting the outdoors ready for winter can be a huge help.
Be a chauffeur. About one in five people over the age of 65 don’t drive. Offer to take your senior loved one to doctor appointments, dental check-ups and eye exams. And accompany them to them to some of their favorite social activities, volunteer opportunities and holiday events so they feel comfortable knowing there will be someone to safely transport them…and you can spend quality time with each other.
Be Santa’s little elf. Help with setting up and decorating their Christmas tree. Make their home festive by decorating their main living space. Help wrap gifts and write and mail their holiday cards. You can even make holiday cookies together.
The holidays can get busy, hectic and overwhelming for all of us. It’s important to remember what the holidays are all about – a season of peace, joy and giving. And remember the aging senior in your life. Just by spending time with them, you can help them have a happy holiday.

359,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/helpful-travel-tips-for-seniors-adventuring-abroad/,"It’s official. Summer is here. It’s time to pack up the suitcase and travel to fun places or family you want to see. There are certainly no age limits to travel! And AARP confirms this with their latest travel report: “More people, age 65 and older, will be traveling this summer, with more than 40% of Baby Boomers reporting that they will be traveling outside of the United States.”
If you or an elderly loved one in your family will be traveling abroad this summer, here are a few key tips you need to know before you go.
Planning: Research and plan your trip well in advance. If you are traveling alone or with someone this summer, planning, reserving, and confirming your travel plans – from accommodations to events to special excursions – will reduce unnecessary stress and unexpected issues while away. For example, if you know there is a place you want to visit, and it requires purchasing tickets, get them in advance if possible.
Your Passport. Bring extra copies of your passport. If it gets lost or stolen, you want to be sure you can get back into the country or prove your citizenship. Consider leaving a copy of your passport at home with a family member or friend as a backup.
Air Travel: When possible, book a non-stop flight. This will reduce your chance of a missed connection and decrease your total travel time. Don’t be shy. Request assistance if you need help navigating the airport or boarding your flight. If you need special services, such as a wheelchair be sure to request and reserve those when booking your flight.
Your Health. Have all prescriptions filled in advance of your trip and bring a few extra days-worth of medications in case of any travel delays. Check with your health professional to get appropriate vaccinations before you go. And know where local medical facilities are in the country or city you are going to visit. Remember to stay hydrated, especially if you’re spending long hours on a plane.
Money and Credit Cards: Make sure you have some local cash on hand because not all places will accept credit cards. If you are traveling outside of the United States with a credit card, contact your bank in advance to let them know of your upcoming travel so that they don’t suddenly turn off your card as a security measure. Also, check to make sure your credit card is widely accepted overseas and it’s a card with no foreign transaction fees. We especially like this “Advice for Traveling Abroad With Your Credit Card” which was provided to us from U.S. News.
Health Insurance: Most people traveling outside of the U.S. believe their health insurance covers them in another country. That might not be the case. When traveling abroad, you may want to buy either a travel medical plan or vacation plan that includes medical emergencies. Also, be aware that Medicare coverage is limited outside of the United States.
Trip Insurance: Consider purchasing trip insurance when booking your airline ticket. Many travel insurance plans include various coverage like trip cancellation, trip interruption, trip delay, lost or delayed baggage. Trip insurance generally covers your purchases and offers some rebooking privileges if your flight is delayed or canceled.
Travel Companions: If you or your elderly loved one wants to travel, but cannot do it alone, consider FirstLight Home Care’s Travel Companion Program. Our extraordinary Caregivers provide care and companionship during your trip. Whether your vacation takes you outside the U.S. or not, our Travel Companion program is designed to make your vacation or family visit as comfortable as possible, with qualified travel companions to accommodate your needs. They can help you get there, get home, and even help throughout your entire stay.

360,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/helping-seniors-de-clutter/,"Moving is hard under the best of circumstances. Moving your aging parents to an assisted living facility or retirement home takes on a whole new level of stress, because what you call “junk” are their prized possessions! Even downsizing to a smaller home can be traumatic.
After living in one home for a long time, your senior parents have cupboards, closets and storage spaces overflowing. It can even look like a bad episode of Hoarders. Most of the heavy lifting and packing will fall to you unless you hire a small move specialist. The hardest part of the move is that your parents are emotionally attached to their collections and memorabilia, so letting go can be painful for them.
Here are some tips to help your parents declutter:
- Listen. Many of the items have stories attached to them. Letting go is not easy, so take the time to listen. Make sure they know you have their best interests at heart. Behind those photos is a lifetime of experience!
- Give items away to family members or friends. You’ll find that family members or friends may need tools, appliances and furniture or will love the sentimentality of an item that meant a lot to your parents. Make a list of what they want to give to whom.
- Map out their new place. They have their “favorite chair”. Map out the new rooms for them so they know how much furniture they can take.
- Donate books. Many libraries or schools are clamoring for books or many assisted living facilities or retirement homes have a center library.
- Donate movies. Do they have movies that their grandchildren have outgrown? Donate them to a children’s home or a shelter.
- Have a garage sale. There may be value in those heirlooms. Considering selling them on eBay or CraigsList or hold a garage sale or estate auction.
- Hire an objective 3rd partry. It might help to get yourself out of the picture and get a 3rd party involved. Consult the National Association of Professional Organizers to find one near you.
- Rent a storage space. It might be best to do the move in steps and rent a storage space until they can see for themselves how much will fit. It will give them security knowing all their possessions are not being given away.
- Pick out charities for donation. There are many reputable charities – some even catering to seniors. Many even let you schedule a pickup online. It will help for them to know that what they are giving will continue to give.
- Junk removal services. Check in a local directory such as Yelp or Google to find local junk removal companies. Some of the more popular ones include: 1800gotjunk.com and JunkGenius.com, A team will arrive right at your front door and help remove unwanted items from the home. Make sure they accept the items you are wanting to give away.
At FirstLight Home Care, our caregivers are more than willing to help your parents pare down, downsize, create more room in their home and/or make it safer to age in place."
361,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/helping-seniors-go-green/,"Most of us are aware that Earth Day is approaching next week on Friday, April 22. A day devoted to raising awareness about the Earth and the issues that affect it, this day is extremely unique for the fact that it is one of the only events that is celebrated worldwide, regardless of religion, politics, gender, age, etc. Many senior citizens want to jump on the green bandwagon and understand the concept but aren’t sure where they can make a difference. Besides acting to help preserve the environment, most seniors acknowledge that going green is a healthy and safe choice they can make on their behalf, yet there can be financial or physical limitations due to their age. Below is a list of easy changes seniors can make in their everyday lifestyle to help contribute to the movement.
Bright idea. One of the easiest and most cost-effective ways to save energy (and cash in the long-term) is to replace all incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescents. This switch can save an average of sixty bucks a year! If the cost to replace all incandescent bulbs is too expensive, start by just changing the bulbs that are used more frequently. Additionally, use dimmers, motion sensors and timers wherever possible to cut down on wasted energy.
Water savers. Water usage contributes almost 15 percent of an average home’s energy bill. Reducing time in the shower and lowering the temperature on the water heater just by a few degrees can make a huge difference in energy consumed. Replacing plastic water bottles by investing in a water purifying system such as a Brita pitcher is also a great way to reduce our carbon footprint.
Green seal. Look for products at the grocery store or supermarket that have the third party certification that the item has low toxicity. Products with these seals don’t contain the chemicals that are known to be harmful to the environment.
So fresh, so clean. Maintaining good hygiene is one of the most effective ways seniors can go green. Making sure dirt and harmful pollutants are away from your home and body helps to reduce time spent in vacuuming, mopping or sweeping the floor thus adding to quality of life, in addition to cutting down on energy used.
It can be hard for anyone to change a life-long habit but it can be done. Starting off with simple, easy steps such as these will help the senior in your life feel like they are making a contribution—every little bit counts!"
362,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/helping-seniors-move/,"When my parents moved from a 6,000 square foot home in Florida to a two bedroom
condo in Arizona, it was a nightmare. What I considered “junk” suddenly became a priceless memory. Although my parents were not hoarders, they had accumulated 20 years of “stuff”, various collections and enough photos to fill a museum.
From my own experience, the #1 tip I can give you if you are moving your aging parents to a new location is patience. Whether the move is voluntary or involuntary, there are many
emotions involved. Emotions are running high as they get very sentimental about leaving. Take the time to listen to their stories because behind many belongings are great memories. What may seem like a rickety table to you is a cherished rememberance of one of their vacations. Try to make packing as fun as possible – my Mom and I set up a “white elephant” pile that we later named the “what were you thinking pile” …we giggled every time we went past!
Here’s some other advice for helping seniors move:
- Take it room by room. Packing the whole house seemed like an insurmountable task. Therefore, we went through the items room by room. We separated the items into two categories – “keep and “giveaway”. Fortunately, there was a Goodwill center near my parent’s home and it seemed like I made daily trips. However, I tried to spread the wealth around by contacting different charities for pickups so my parents could see their items would be going toward good use. Every box was clearly labeled with the name of the room and a description of the items inside. There were many things they didn’t want to get rid of, but I knew would never fit in their new home. I labeled them in boxes called “storage” and arranged for a storage space near their new home in Arizona. They will let go of these items when the time is right for them.
- Start a redecorating fund. Because my parents were downsizing, I knew that many of heir large furniture pieces would not fit in their new home. I helped them sell it at consignment shops and on Craig’s List. I then took the proceeds and started a “redecorating fund” for their new home. This gave my Mom something fun to look forward to – a new TV whose back wasn’t as big as a boat!
- Get bids. Some moving companies who will try and take advantage of seniors. I not only got them three bids, but I read the fine print. A few items were broken in the move and I helped them file claims with the moving company.
- If possible, help them unpack. Helping parents transition from one home to another is easier of you can help them unpack on the other end. They need
someone or something familiar in their new location. First of all, don’t let them lift heavy boxes despite their protests – hire some college kids who are young with strong backs to help them move the furniture around! I immediately put up some pictures to make their new place seem more like home.
- Familiarize them with their new community. When we weren’t unpacking, we went on jaunts through the neighborhood. I made sure they knew the locations for the grocery stores, post office, hospitals, doctor’s offices and restaurants. I introduced myself to their neighbors and gave them my phone number in case of emergency.
My best house warming present to my parents? My time and labor. It was two weeks well spent!"
363,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/holiday-blessings-health-of-our-loved-ones/,"Holidays throughout the year are filled with excitement and joy. Most families look forward to holiday seasons as a time to gather family together, celebrate and look forward to another year. The holidays bring a time for thankfulness, tradition, reflection and hope.
Traditions bring fond memories; although for families experiencing issues that come with aging family members such as complex medical conditions or dementia the holidays may mean rising concerns with new challenges. Many of us who live a long distance from parents and are in the “sandwich generation” are at an age where we may still be working, have kids, grandkids living in our home and parents who are beginning to experience issues with their health miles away.
This is a time all of us should use to make important observations. Questions such as are your loved ones still dressing like they used to, are they talking louder, how comfortable are they with driving, or do they look as though they are losing weight? You may discover they are having more trouble with simple activities and memory.
Festivities can still be fun for everyone but let’s consider a few things to make them better. Remember hearing issues can make the individual feel isolated, unable to participate and frustrated. Inability to sleep or sleeping excessively can be caused by prescribed medications, digestive disturbances may occur with changes in routines, emotional situations as well as unusual foods. Physical ailments and suffering can take on the appearance of being “grumpy” or “mad”, when the real reason is because they just may not feel well. Stay vigilant, be tolerant, remain patient and make adjustments to help everyone enjoy their time together. Keep in mind we are all aging and will eventually experience some of these changes ourselves.
So how can we make happy holidays for all of the family? A few tips to keep a smile on everyone’s face include:
• Be grateful for everyone in your life and the time you get to spend with them.
• Share what you appreciate about each other; you will be amazed at the reactions.
• Treat each other honorably and with respect.
• Include everyone in the planning and preparations. My mother-in-law with Alzheimer’s and grandchildren make the table decorations.
• Make everyone’s favorite; whether it is cheesy bread or sweet potato pie, it always gets eaten.
• Keep everyone comfortable – a warm environment is best for the elderly so have everyone else dress accordingly.
• Provide a relaxed atmosphere. We have a “free nap” policy which means anyone can take a nap and no one will bother them.
• Another policy is “open snacking”, better known as eat what you want, when you want.
• Ask for stories! Let everyone share their favorite memory. Bring out picture albums or share videos. Watch movies together; Disney is a favorite!
• Have everyone participate in activities. Our grandchildren love the Wii and we have family team bowling, archery, and golf competitions. Our 90 year old mother loves to fly the plane through different fictional places in “Fly Over”.
• Give love and you will find it will expand and grow!
• Make certain to share your appreciation for everyone’s help.
• Have everyone leave feeling good about their time together!

365,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/holiday-gift-giving-for-loved-ones-with-alzheimers-or-dementia/,"Shopping for holiday gifts for family members with Alzheimer’s can be tricky. You may be unsure about what they enjoy or what they’re capable of doing. When choosing a gift, think about their personality, their hobbies, their abilities and their favorite pastimes.
A few great gift suggestions for those with Alzheimer’s include:
A family calendar
Give your loved one a personalized calendar for your family. Include pictures of family member—grandchildren, children, nieces, nephews, cousins, anyone who is close with your loved one. In addition to photos, take the time to fill in any special dates like birthdays, anniversaries, holidays and family reunions.
Comfortable clothing
Any clothing that you’re buying for a loved one with Alzheimer’s should be comfortable, easy to put on or take off and machine washable. Consider items like sweatshirts, sweatpants, pajamas, sweaters, slip-on shoes or a warm robe.
Music
Give your family member the gift of music this holiday season. Buy them a CD full of their favorite songs by their favorite singers. Music can help those with Alzheimer’s to remember times from their past marked by specific songs or groups.
Identification bracelets
This gift is especially great if your family member is prone to wandering from the house. Identification bracelets are available from many different providers and help to ensure that your loved one makes it home safely if they leave the house unattended.
Home adaptation equipment
You know your loved one better than anyone else. If they have problems in the bathroom, think about buying bathtub safety bars or non-slip bathmats. For those that get up in the middle of the night, consider motion detected nightlights. There are many home adaptation options, so it can be relatively easy to find something to fit your senior’s needs.
Entertainment
DVDs of movies, musicals or plays can be a great gift. Make a list of their favorites and pick them up as they’re available. You can also purchase tickets for a movie, play, sporting event or a fun day trip with friends and family.
Have you ever given a gift to a loved one with Alzheimer’s that has been a hit? We’d love to hear about it!"
366,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/holiday-meals-with-aging-loved-ones/,"The holiday season is upon us! For many, the holidays are a time to gather with family around the dining room table, enjoying food and conversation. However, the holidays are often a time when many seniors become increasingly frustrated by their disabilities. As a family caregiver, it is important to be aware of any limitations that your aging loved one may have while planning a holiday meal. That includes everything from adapted cooking tools that will allow them to stay involved in the meal preparation to seating arrangements to help them feel comfortable with conversation during the meal.
Meal Preparation:
As seniors begin to age, meal preparation can become more and more difficult because of arthritis or other conditions that limit mobility. But, there are some adapted kitchen tools that will allow them to continue to contribute to the meal preparation process.
- Substitute a pizza cutter for a knife.
Holding and controlling a knife can be hard for seniors. Pizza cutters offer larger handles and are easier to control.
- Invest in non-slip mats.
Placing a non-slip mat under cutting boards or plates during the meal prep process helps to ensure that the cutting surface won’t move unexpectedly.
- Use self-opening or spring-loaded kitchen shears.
Instead of using scissors or a knife to open containers or bags, use self-opening or spring-loaded kitchen shears—they’ll help to decrease the stress on the joints.
Table Setting:
Table setting accommodations can help to make aging loved ones and those with disabilities feel more comfortable and at ease during the holiday meal. Consider some of these simple adaptations when planning your holiday meal:
- Use utensils with a larger grip.
Forks, knives and spoons with thin, delicate handles may look great, but they can be hard for seniors to use. The larger the handle, the easier it is to grip.
- Choose dark colored plates.
Holiday meals tend to be rather monochromatic. Using a dark colored plate helps to make the food stand out on the plate and makes it easier for seniors to see what they’re eating.
- Provide glasses with handles.
For seniors with arthritis or shaky hands, glasses with handles are much easier to hold than ones without.
- Smaller tables are best.
If you have a large family or have a lot of people coming to the holiday meal, consider using a few small tables instead of one larger table. This is especially helpful for family members with hearing challenges, as small tables are less overwhelming and make it easier for them to participate in conversation.

367,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/holiday-presents-time-to-assess-care-needs/,"The holiday weekend is almost upon us! As families prepare to celebrate the upcoming 4th of July with picnics, fireworks and a few rousing games of Bocce ball, it’s also an important time to remember the people who make these moments so special. With burgers on the grill and good times abounding, it may not seem like the most practical moment to start a conversation about whether an elderly individual in your life is a candidate for long-term care; but having the talk before any problems arise is actually the smartest thing to do, because it allows both parties to speak candidly and openly about their wants and needs.
Here are a few helpful tips on how to get the conversation started this holiday weekend and beyond.
Assess your surroundings: Maybe you are visiting a relative or loved one you haven’t seen in a while; this weekend will be a good opportunity to access his or her living environment. Keep an eye out for disorganization, as well as a change in demeanor. If you are visiting his or her home, pay attention to the living conditions. Are the dishes piled high? Is their living space exceptionally messy? Many times, family members won’t discover there is a health concern until they visit for a holiday. That’s why checking on older relatives is important, despite time constraints.
Do your homework: Make sure you have a plan in place before talking to a loved one. Research your options and think about budget. How much is he or she willing to spend—and maybe more importantly, how much are you willing to spend? Bringing up the possibility of in-home care is an optimal solution for an elder who is adamant about staying in his or her home—which is not an uncommon occurrence.
Stay positive: It’s important not to mandate anything. Seniors want to know that their opinion matters, so engage them in conversation. Observe how receptive they are to various solutions. As a rule, it’s best to start the conversation in their home. So dropping by for the holiday may be a good time to sit down and see what may need to be done for future care.
Most importantly—spending time with your loved one or senior in your life can be the best plan of all this holiday weekend, regardless of where the conversation takes you. Enjoy being active and above all, enjoy spending time with one another. Happy 4th!"
368,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/holiday-tips-for-senior-travel-travel-companions/,"The holidays will be here before we know it. If your senior loved one wants to travel this merry season, be sure to get them where they need to go safely and with minimal stress.

Holiday travel, especially senior travel, can be hectic and stressful if it’s not properly planned with a well-organized itinerary and companion services.

Everyone knows the stress that traveling entails, especially senior travel.

For seniors, the stress of travel is often amplified to the point that they feel uncomfortable traveling, and sadly it keeps many from participating in these family events that we all enjoy.

Holiday Tips For Elderly Travel
With the right research and planning, you can get your senior loved one where they need to go safely regardless of using companion services. Below are a few tips on how to make holiday travel a seamless process that keeps seniors comfortable, relaxed and arriving at their destination with ease.
Prepare documents and medications
When booking flights, you and your senior should get as much information as possible. Having an informational packet put together will help everyone know what to expect and feel prepared for whatever may arise.
Your packet should include:
- Flight departure and arrival times
- Transportation options to and from the airport
- Terminal maps and gate locations
- Medication regulations and necessary documents
- TSA safety check process
Look through the TSA website to learn about which medications are allowed and how to communicate with an officer about medically necessary bottles or containers. Request copies of prescriptions and statements of medical conditions from each physician and medical center for verification.
Making photocopies of passports, driver’s license, insurance cards, travel tickets and the trip’s itinerary provides a backup in case of any unforeseen emergencies. Keep one set of copies with you (the caregiver), place a set of the documents in your senior’s carry-on bag and forward a set of the documents to the destination.
Research elderly travel companions
For some seniors, traveling can be tricky no matter how well-planned their trip may be—whether it’s mobility issues, medication concerns or just anxiety that comes with travel. As the family caregiver, it might make sense for you to find a senior travel companion to help your loved one along on their trip, especially if you are unable to travel with them.
Elderly travel companions assist senior travelers every step of the way. They keep them company, remind them to take their medications, and provide family caregivers at home with peace of mind knowing someone is there with your traveler’s best interest in mind.
Consider insurance
When you’re a senior traveler, there are additional factors that should be considered regarding insurance. What happens if a fall takes place or you run out of your medication?
Health Insurance: If traveling within the United States, be sure to look up what hospitals accept your health insurance and if there is coverage during travel. If going abroad, look at buying a travel medical plan or vacation plan that includes medical emergencies.
Trip Insurance: There are a few different options when choosing trip insurance. For seniors, there can be unexpected delays due to appointments, or medical clearance delays. Therefore, it is ideal that trip cancellation protection is provided.

369,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/holiday-travel-for-seniors/,"The holidays will be here before we know it. If your senior wants to travel this merry season, be sure to get them where they need to go safely and with minimal stress.
Holiday travel can be hectic and stressful if it’s not properly planned with a well-organized itinerary. If you are a son or daughter in charge of caring for a senior loved one – be it your parent or grandparent, or even close family friend – there may be times that they will want to fly for vacation or to visit other relatives during the holidays. And you may not always be able to accompany them.
With the right research and planning, you can get your senior loved one where they need to go safely. Below are a few tips on how to make holiday travel a seamless process that keeps seniors comfortable, relaxed and arriving at their destination with ease.
#1. Prepare documents and medications
When booking flights, you and your senior should get as much information as possible. Having an informational packet put together will help everyone know what to expect and feel prepared for whatever may arise.
Your packet should include:
- Flight departure and arrival times
- Transportation options to and from the airport
- Terminal maps and gate locations
- Medication regulations and necessary documents
- TSA safety check process
Look through the TSA website to learn about which medications are allowed and how to communicate with an officer about medically necessary bottles or containers. Request copies of prescriptions and statements of medical conditions from each physician and medical center for verification.
Making photocopies of passports, driver’s license, insurance cards, travel tickets, and the trip’s itinerary provides a backup in case of any unforeseen emergencies. Keep one set of copies with you (the caregiver), place a set of the documents in your senior’s carry-on bag, and forward a set of the documents to the destination.
#2. Research travel companions
For some seniors, traveling can be tricky no matter how well-planned their trip may be – whether it’s mobility issues, medication concerns or just anxiety that comes with travel. As the family caregiver, it might make sense for you to find a travel companion to help your loved one along on their trip, especially if you are unable to travel with them.
Travel companions assist senior travelers every step of the way. They keep them company, remind them to take their medications, and provide family caregivers at home with peace of mind knowing someone is there with your traveler’s best interest in mind.
#3. Book for Comfort
When booking a flight for a senior, select an aisle seat. No matter how long the flight is, it’s important for senior travelers to have a seat located in the aisle. One of the most critical risks for senior travelers is DVT, or deep vein thrombosis. Blood clots can form in the legs and travel to the lungs, causing serious health concerns during or after a long flight, simply because a person did not move or stretch often enough.
Even if a senior is in good health, they should try to get up and stretch during a flight (with assistance) to keep their limbs from falling asleep, their blood flowing, and to help avoid discomfort or fatigue due to poor oxygen/blood circulation.
Items to consider for maximum comfort:
- A travel pillow that cradles the neck, head and chin can prevent straining the muscles.
- Noise-canceling headphones are a great investment for seniors sensitive to noise.
- Traveling seniors should always pack something light to eat in case of unexpected delays, especially if they need to take medicine with food during the flight. This also avoids the need to get their money out in a public place.
- Compression socks can help maintain blood flow and decrease swelling.
#4. Consider Insurance
When you’re a senior traveler, there are additional factors that should be considered regarding insurance. What happens if a fall takes place or you run out of your medication?
Health Insurance: If traveling within the United States, be sure to look up what hospitals accept your health insurance and if there is coverage during travel. If going abroad, look at buying a travel medical plan or vacation plan that includes medical emergencies.
Trip Insurance: There are a few different options when choosing trip insurance. For seniors, there can be unexpected delays due to appointments, or medical clearance delays. Therefore, it is ideal that trip cancellation protection is provided.
Look at the different costs of trip insurance to see if there is a policy right for you. If finding a broker seems like a hassle, the right travel credit card can offer flight cancellation protection, priority boarding and free checked bags. Of course, only use credit cards if you understand the importance of paying the trip off in full by the due date to avoid interest and negative marks on your credit scores.
Remember, it’s important to continue to live life to the fullest at any age. Following these basic tips will be sure to save you a few headaches during holiday travel. Keep this merry season filled with fun adventures and safe travels.

370,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/holidays-and-elderly-loneliness/,"Isolation, regardless of your age, can kill. But for the elderly this seems to be bigger problem that many do not address. If family lives out-of-state and it is hard for them to visit frequently, the person may be alone for long periods of time. Loneliness can cause health problems. Clinical depression can develop – a genuine illness which is much more serious than just feeling low. In many, loneliness can lead to drinking problems and often causes reduced levels of activity and exercise as well as poor diet.
Prolonged isolation can damage the immune system, leaving people more vulnerable to infections. It can also affect the cardio-vascular system, increasing the risk of heart and circulatory problems. Lack of social interaction has also been linked to the onset of Alzheimer’s disease.
Unchecked, loneliness can gradually steal health away from the elderly, reducing not only their quality of life, but its length as well. This is why it is crucial to take action, even if your elderly parent is not keen on the idea.
If you are going to see your aging parents or elderly family and friends this holiday season, you should take time to check in with them and to look for clues that may help you to start a conversation with them and the time they spend alone when you’re not there.
- Body language. Does your parent’s posture suggest a ‘defeated demeanor’? Sometimes we can assume a lowered head or slumped posture is simply down to old age, but it could be expressing the emotional impact of isolation. Look also for tightly crossed arms and legs.
- Highly talkative. Someone who is lonely may well gush with chatter when they have the opportunity, as if they are making the most of a chance to talk.
- Prolonged holding of your hand or arm. Sometimes the lonely will try to cling on to any opportunity for physical contact.
- Lack of social circles. Ask them about the activities they are doing to get them engaged in the local community. For many seniors their social circles are dwindling and they do not know how or where to find new friends.
The holiday season can bring to the surface a family members feeling of loneliness. If you spot some of the trends noted above, take time to address while you are face-to-face. Use this time to help them find solutions to their feelings of loneliness. And remember, loneliness is when you are unhappy to be alone. Solitude is when you are happy to be alone. There is nothing wrong with solitude, wanting to, or enjoying being alone. Alone time can be useful and enjoyable.

371,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/holidays-tips-help-older-adults-caregivers/,"We’ve all been there. While our vision for the holiday season is one of intimate gatherings, delicious meals and bliss, the reality can be much the opposite. The volume of activities, shifting of schedules, decadent food and potential for conflict can put added strain on the entire family. Especially older adults.
If you’re an older adult, or if you care for someone who is, you can make the holidays more manageable by taking just a short amount of time to plan ahead. By considering some of the factors you can control this season, you can make the holidays safer, healthier and merrier.
Here are our tips for surviving – and savoring – the holiday season.
- Set realistic expectations.
Most people have a tendency to romanticize the holiday season. They yearn for the movie-scene, stress-free experiences where everyone is happy and healthy. Where everything is easy and there are no mishaps. But the reality is that, for most families, the holidays don’t go exactly as planned. They bring some stress. And they may even be a source of conflict. By expecting the unexpected during the holidays, you can be prepared for whatever they hold and eliminate the disappointment that can come with inflated expectations.
- Plan ahead for dietary needs.
The holidays are the time of extravagant menus. Decadent treats. And favorite traditional foods. But older adults may have dietary needs that prevent them from indulging. If you’re planning a holiday meal or event, be sure to ask your guests about special dietary needs in advance. If you’re the person with the special needs, consider bringing your own dish. Or modify elements of the meal you’re served.
- Be aware of safety risks in unfamiliar homes.
For older adults with disabilities or mobility challenges, an unfamiliar place can be loaded with hidden hazards. Be aware of things like throw rugs, door mats, barriers in doorways or hallways, and cords or loose items that may present a fall risk for older adults. Keep rooms and hallways illuminated. And if a holiday event is being hosted in the home of an older adult with any type of cognitive condition or memory loss, consider how moving furniture or changing the configuration of a room might effect their experience.
- Be prepared for quickly changing weather conditions.
December is a month that, in many parts of the country, can bring extreme fluctuations in temperature and weather. Layering can help ensure older adults are comfortable during the holidays. And appropriate outerwear – including hats, gloves and boots – can help protect them from the elements as they make their way to all of their holiday events and activities. If you live in colder climates, be sure you’re armed with shovels, salt and other supplies that will keep porches and walkways safe.
- Recognize the signs of seasonal depression.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that 7 million adults over the age of 65 experience depression. Why? Because depression can be triggered by certain health conditions, and even medications. It can also become more likely when an older adult is adjusting to a significant change, such as a loss, illness or home relocation. The holiday season can intensify depression and its symptoms for older adults. If you or someone you love is experiencing deep feelings of sadness or anxiety, a change in eating or sleeping habits or loss of interest in daily activities and/or personal hygiene, see your doctor.
- Try to maintain a schedule and routine.
While it may not be possible to maintain every routine during the busy holiday season, keeping some structure can be invaluable for older adults. Predictability and consistency in schedule and routine can help improve quality of life. And studies have shown that routines can help reduce stress and anxiety; enhance feelings of safety, security and confidence; and aid in better sleep. While some routines can have some degree of flexibility, there is one that cannot – and that is the medication schedule. Be sure to keep it on track as holiday activities take hold. Consider calendar reminders, alerts or alarms to help ensure older adults continue prescribed dosage and schedule for important medications.
- Get adequate sleep.
Getting effective, restorative sleep can be a challenge for older adults. The aging process, chronic health conditions and certain medications can disrupt sleep. And contrary to popular belief, people don’t need less sleep as they age. Older adults require about the same amount of sleep as their 20-year-old counterparts. Sleep deprivation can effect mood, memory and cognition – among other things – in older adults. And it can have an impact on their ability to enjoy the holiday season. So don’t shortchange sleep in favor of more holiday activities. And be sure older adults get plenty of rest after traveling, when the body may need extra time to recover.
- Find ways to include everyone in activities.
It can be difficult – and even emotional – for older adults whose age or health prevent them from participating in activities or playing their traditional holiday roles. Think about new ways to get them involved. For example, break down meal-preparation tasks and assign appropriate roles to family members young and old. Plan games or activities that can be enjoyed by everyone. Tag-team on gift wrapping or shopping.
- Don’t do it all alone.
For many older adults, they no longer have the health status or stamina to manage the holiday activities they once could. If you’re an older adult, ask for help. If you care for an older adult, be sure to check in to identify needed help or support. And don’t forget that there are resources – like home care – that can help you manage all of the demands on the holiday season, and beyond.
- Enjoy your time together.
Regardless of how the meals, parties, gifts or activities of the holiday season play out, remember to enjoy the time spent with family and friends. Connecting and engaging with loved ones can be meaningful and fulfilling for older adults, contributing to overall happiness and well-being.

372,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/home-automation-and-its-many-benefits/,"Every home, regardless of its location, is at risk for vandalism and burglary. The only person who can combat that risk is the homeowner. It is the homeowner’s responsibility, if they feel unsafe, to choose a suitable security system to keep his or her home protected. When the resident of the home in question is someone as vulnerable as a senior citizen, the need for a reliable system is only that much greater.
Sounding the Alarm
One of the most basic but important features any senior home security system should have is an alarm. Alarms, when functioning, will go off when a door, window, or even a gate is opened or disturbed. Alarms both alert the homeowner to a security breach and can also scare off the potential intruder. Some alarms will even automatically alert local law enforcement when the alarm has been activated, allowing homeowners to get help if needed and increasing the chances of catching a fleeing intruder.
The Right Timing
Many modern security systems also allow the homeowner to set up lights and appliances, like the television, to go off and on according to a timer. While it might not seem like lights that flicker on at a certain time or a television that suddenly starts blaring wouldn’t be very effective at keeping intruders at bay, this can actually be a huge help. When homeowners are going to be away for an extended period of time, timer-operated devices give the appearance that someone is at home and alert, thereby reducing the chance of vandalism or burglary.
A Constant Connection
Even older security systems are usually able to contact the local authorities in the event of a security breach. Unfortunately, older systems tend to do so through landline telephone connections, and many homeowners no longer have landline telephones. Furthermore, intruders can easily cut a landline if they have even basic knowledge of phone lines. For this reason, the best and most modern security systems utilize cellular connections, accessible through simple phone apps, to ensure that help can always be sought when needed. Wearable devices, like those sold by ADT, are also able to contact an operator in the event of an emergency. The device is worn as a pendant or on the wrist, and can also detect if the wearer has fallen. The Philips Lifeline offers a similar service, in the form of a pendant as well. These systems give the senior at home the option of being in constant contact with a helpline, and give worried family members peace of mind knowing their loved one’s home security needs are taken care of.
Safety All Around
Many modern security systems can do double (or even triple!) duty by acting as security systems, smoke detectors and/or carbon monoxide detectors- one example is Google’s famous Nest. While homeowners can buy each of these items separately, it’s generally much more convenient to have all security features operated and maintained from the same device. Seniors with certain conditions also face additional risks when choosing to live at home alone. Alzheimer’s patients may get lost and confused when returning home. To prevent this from happening, GPS systems in smartphones are now being used to locate lost family members. Medication-dispensing devices are convenient for elderly folks who have trouble remembering their proper dosages or when to take certain pills. A machine contains the medication, sorted into cups, that should be taken each day. An alarm sounds when the medicine should be administered by the patient or their caregiver. If the button on the machine is not pushed after ninety minutes of reminder alarms, then a message text is sent to a designated recipient.
Going Green and Staying Safe
Automated home systems make it possible to control the lights, temperature, and security of an entire home all from one panel. They reduce the need to walk around turning lights on and off, checking locks, and adjusting the thermostat, by consolidating and automating much of the home care process. With many of these systems, users can set timers to ensure that all the doors lock at bedtime, the temperature is adjusted to a preferred sleeping temperature, the lights are off and everything is secure. For senior citizens, and their caretakers, these services can be a blessing.
New home automation technologies, some of them new and some still ahead on the horizon, strive to provide elderly users with the dignity and independence they deserve. Advances in automated technology are occurring rapidly- relieving many of the burdens associated with homeownership for a new generation.

373,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/home-care-alternative-to-assisted-living/,"Most adults over the age of 65 prefer to stay in their own homes for as long as possible. We know that there are many long-term benefits of allowing adults the freedom to age in place. Staying at home helps seniors maintain a routine, and home provides the familiarity and comfort that no other place can.
While aging at home is the ideal situation, many seniors need help with various tasks throughout the day to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle. When faced with this need, some gravitate toward assisted living or other senior living communities. While these options offer some advantages like meals, socialization, and extra support to aging adults, they are not the best fit for everyone. Home care can be an alternative.
The Elderly Often Need Specialized Care
We believe that the very nature of home care makes it the safest care environment for elderly individuals, especially now during this time of COVID-19. We know that potential exposure to the virus remains the lowest for those who can stay in their homes with limited outside contact.
The elderly population often needs specialized care to keep them stay safe and well. Because personal and companion care services are delivered one-to-one in the home environment, professional caregivers are in the best position to provide that much-needed care.
The home care industry also follows COVID-19 guidelines established by the centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Caregivers take every precaution necessary to safeguard the health and safety of themselves and their clients. This includes always following established infection control protocols and being vigilant about protecting everyone from illness, be it the flu, COVID-19, or any other communicable disease.
Depending on the level of care your loved one requires, home care services can meet a variety of needs to help aging adults maintain their independence and quality of life. Home care can:
Help with activities of daily living. Home care services allow seniors to remain in their homes but still have the support they need, whether it’s on a short or long-term basis. Caregivers can assist with activities of daily living (ADLs), including bathing and personal hygiene, walking and mobility, continence and toileting care, special diets and meal preparation.
Caregivers also can ensure elderly clients have the necessary supply of essentials on hand, such as freezer-friendly and non-perishable foods; prescription and over-the-counter medications; and household supplies, like toilet paper, paper towels, soap and detergent.
Provide support while recovering or rehabilitating. Home care can be an alternative to a skilled nursing facility for people who are being discharged from the hospital. Home care provides needed support while one recovers or rehabilitates while also helping them maintain independence. The one-to-one, personalized care also reduces the number of people and germs that they are exposed to, which can be a concern right now.
Help address social isolation. When seniors choose to remain in their homes there is a potential for isolation and loneliness. Home care can still address the concern over social isolation. Professional caregivers can be there for the senior when their loved ones can’t be; they can help clients stay connected to friends and family through video chat, phone calls and more; they can keep clients active with light exercise and other activities; or they can simply provide companionship.
Deliver dementia and Alzheimer’s care. This type of care can be provided at home to help families cope with the anxiety, depression, confusion and isolation that are often associated with Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia. Providing this type of care in the home in familiar surroundings can offer a level of comfort that is unmatched. FirstLight Home Care has certified memory care practitioners who utilize training provided by the National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners to develop personalized, engaging care plans for clients with various forms of dementia.
Offer family respite care services. Respite care allows family members in that primary caregiver role to take some time off from their responsibilities so they can focus on themselves for a while. While they’re away, a professional caregiver can be there to make sure that their loved one is well taken care of. The caregiver’s goal is to keep loved ones as safe and comfortable as possible.
Sometimes seniors find it difficult to have strangers come into their homes to help with the daily things they are used to doing for themselves. Home care can match caregivers with clients based on the personality, interests and needs of the client and family. An ideal match helps to build lasting relationships that provide solace to the senior and peace of mind for the family.
FirstLight Home Care provides daily assistance and the essential support the elderly need to remain in the place they call home. Whether you need options for yourself or for an aging loved one, we are here to help.
Contact our team today to learn more about how you can benefit from our home care services as an alternative to assisted living or other senior living communities.

374,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/home-care-assisted-living/,"In-home care vs. assisted living can be a difficult choice. Many families faced with the decision on which is best for their aging loved one might not even be sure of the differences between the two. Determining the best place for aging parents or loved ones to receive the care they need to live a vibrant and independent life will depend on individuals needs and care requirements.
With in-home care, a caregiver is hired to come into the home to help with activities of daily living. Home care offers companion care and personal care services to help seniors maintain their freedom and independence so that they may continue living safely at home.
Assisted Living Facilities can also be great options for seniors who need help with some of the activities of daily living. These are communities in which seniors live in rooms or small apartments. These facilities offer safety and security in knowing that assistance is always just a phone call away. But they also promote privacy and independence.
BENEFITS TO CONSIDER WITH IN-HOME CARE
- In-home care allows your loved one to live safely in their own home, whether that individual needs some assistance to live independently, is recovering from a medical illness or surgery, or is an adult who has special needs or disability.
- If your loved one needs non-medical support and services, an in-home caregiver can be a family member or a trained professional.
- In-home care providers can adjust their non-medical services based on your loved one needs. Care can be day-to-day, overnight or scheduled care throughout the week.
- If your loved one just needs support around the home, services can include help with light household chores, such as laundry and vacuuming, as well as other tasks that help maintain a safe and healthy living environment.
- If your loved one wants to live at home but needs to reduce the amount of driving they do, an in-home caregiver can provide transportation to run errands, doctor appointments or social events with friends in the community.
- In-home caregivers can provide one-to-one care and individualized attention.
- Caregivers can be another set of eyes ensuring that your loved one is taking the right medications when required, is eating properly, dressing, bathing, and is able to function in and around their home.
- Care is customized based on the family’s needs and can be adjusted as your loved one ages.
- In-home care provides peace of mind to family members who do not live close by. They can feel confident that their senior who is living independently is receiving the personal and companion care they need.
CHALLENGES OF IN-HOME CARE
- If the caregiver is a family member, caregiver burnout can happen. Without a respite care strategy in place to support the primary caregiver, it can impact not only the aging loved one, but the entire family.
- If 24-hour care at home is needed, hiring a professional caregiver it may not fit within the budget, and thus more responsibility falls on local family members.
- Your aging loved one may outlive their home and it may be difficult to make modifications inside the home to adjust to the changes in mobility that happen with aging.
BENEFITS TO CONSIDER WITH ASSISTED LIVING
- If your loved one needs more daily socialization and ongoing interaction, assisted living facilities create a communal living environment and provide on-site activities so your family loved one isn’t living alone.
- If you’re concerned that your loved one isn’t eating properly, assisted living facilities provide healthy meal options to ensure proper nutrition. Meals are prepared and served in a common dining area to further support socialization; however, some facilities have kitchenettes in their individual suite or apartment, so your loved one has the option of preparing some of their own meals if they choose.
- Assisted living facilities provide a turnkey solution for potential maintenance or other issues that arise within an apartment or suite.
- Many facilities provide their own group transportation services for shopping, excursions and community events.
- Doctors, nurses and other geriatric professionals are always on site and the level of care can be expanded upon as needed.
CHALLENGES OF ASSISTED LIVING
- Most aging family members want to remain living at home. Additionally, moving could be extremely stressful and the family member may not adapt to their new living environment very easily.
- The costs associated with moving to an assisted living facility may be too expensive.
- If the facility does not offer more advanced levels of care, the family may need to move their loved one to a nursing home when their conditions deteriorate beyond a certain level of dependency.
- One-to-one care and personal bonding may not occur if the assisted living facility has a high staff turnover rate. If you want your family member to have more personalized care, it could cost more.
There will always be specific benefits and challenges to consider when determining if your loved one should stay in their home or if they should move into an assisted living facility. Each family is different and the needs of their loved one will vary based on physical limitations, social desires, and personal motivation.
When a family needs to determine the best place for a loved one to live, it’s important to weigh the financial concerns, family availability, the personalized care the individual needs, their desire to move, and much more before making any change.

375,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/home-care-enhancing-lives-people-developmental-disabilities/,"For an estimated 5 million people in communities across the United States, developmental disabilities are part of life. Their conditions – autism, Down syndrome, muscular dystrophy and cerebral palsy, to name a few – may impact physical capacity, language, learning or behavior, but not their spirit. When people with these different abilities are connected to the right opportunities and resources, they can live secure, fulfilling lives.
March is Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month. And the observance is an opportunity to explore how we can all do more to help our neighbors, friends and family members who have developmental disabilities live side-by-side with other people in their communities. For so many of them, the ultimate goal is the same as anyone else – to be independent, productive members of society. With the support of their families, caregivers and communities, they can accomplish just that.
Advocating for self-directed living
Organizations like The Arc and the National Association of Councils on Developmental Disabilities advocate for the equity and inclusion of people with disabilities in all aspects of society. They promote self-determination, and support the right of individuals with developmental disabilities to make their own decisions about their lives and wellbeing. They also work to advance that agenda at the state and national levels. On the personal front, families and caregivers are a crucial part of the support system that enables people who have disabilities to seek more individual choices and greater freedoms. But attaining those freedoms may require reaching out for additional support.
Enhancing independence and quality of life
To live the most fulfilling lives, people with developmental disabilities may need help with the activities of daily living, mobility and transportation. And they might be surprised to learn that home care can support all of those needs. Non-medical home care services aren’t just for older adults. They can also enhance the lives of adults of all ages who have disabilities, helping them achieve the independence they crave and allowing them to engage – side-by-side – with others in their communities.
FirstLight Home Care provides services designed specifically for people ages 18 and older who have developmental disabilities. Our caregivers can help them live self-directed lives through a variety of Personal Care and Companion Care services, including:
- Light housekeeping
- Laundry services
- Shopping and errands
- Transportation
- Company and companionship
- Recreational activities
- Bathing, hygiene and continence care
- Walking and mobility
- Transfer and posture
- Meal preparation and eating assistance
- Respite care for family caregivers
Supporting and celebrating people with developmental disabilities
Each day, FirstLight caregivers provide the encouragement, companionship and support our clients with developmental disabilities need to pursue their life goals. And we celebrate their every achievement. Find a location today to learn more about our services."
376,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/home-care-for-the-holidays/,"When we talk about home care at FirstLight Homecare, we are usually referring to our home healthcare services. However, as the holidays are upon us, I began to think of the other “home care” services I could get my parents for the holidays.
Every year I wrestle over what to get my parents. They are in their late 70s and have virtually everything they want. They live in the same home I grew up in and if I even mention the word “upgrade” or “remodel”, they shush me. My Mom likes her well-worn furniture, because it is comfortable. And that’s what counts.
So what to get them, what to get them? I really wanted a thoughtful present, one that took more time than grabbing a gift from a shelf at Kohl’s. And then it struck me. The perfect gift: the gift of home care literally.
Chances are your parents are older and they shouldn’t be crawling around on ladders or moving furniture to remove the dust bunnies on the floor. Here’s five great ideas that you can either hire or do yourself that could be a lifeline for your parents in their home:
- A handyman. Whether it’s an apartment or a house, things break. If my Dad
attempts a “Honey Do” project, it costs us twice as much to undo his repairs!
Find a qualified handyman to take care of all those annoying repairs that need
to be made.
- A caregiver. If one of your parents is caring for the other, give them a
break. At FirstLight Home Care, our caregivers can provide respite care on an
hourly, short term or long term basis. Our senior care services can provide
welcome relief!
- Window washer and gutter cleaning. Although this isn’t a very exciting holiday gift, it’s a home maintenance item that is virtually impossible for seniors to tackle.
- Carpet cleaning. My parents have two dogs and with the mud they drag in, their carpets need to be cleaned. With failing eye sight, they don’t seem to notice
the spots and dirt!
- Housekeeper. My Mom prides herself on still being able to clean the house. However, it could really use a deep clean, getting to spots where she can’t reach.
Many seniors are too proud to admit they need help, particularly around the house with everyday activities we take for granted. Help your parents spruce up their home for the holidays!"
377,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/home-care-for-veterans-and-their-families/,"Throughout the month of November especially, we reflect on all the men and women who have served honorably in the military. The sacrifices they have made allow our country to remain strong, safe and free.
Serving in the military can often impact one’s health, both emotionally and physically. And for many veterans, young and old, disabling injuries may make it difficult to perform some of the basic activities we do every day – things that we often take for granted. These activities of daily living (ADLs) include things such as eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, mobility and transferring, and more.
Home care for veterans requires family caregivers to be strong, but also flexible. Many veterans live at home and need assistance around the house and providing this daily support can often drain family caregivers emotionally as they try to take on all the tasks their loved one needs.
That is where non-medical home care for veterans can help. Professional companion care and personal care services provided by a home care aide or caregiver can assist with everything from household duties such as cooking, laundry and running errands to individual needs like bathing and personal hygiene and mobility assistance.
Home care for veterans may be more affordable than you think
There are benefits that could help veterans pay for this much-needed assistance. VA Aid and Attendance benefits or Housebound allowance provide monthly payments added to the amount of a monthly VA pension for qualified veterans and survivors.
Individuals may be eligible for the VA Aid and Attendance benefit if they get a VA pension and meet at least one of the following requirements:
- They need another person to help them perform daily activities, like bathing, eating and dressing, or
- They must stay in bed—or spend a large portion of the day in bed—because of illness, or
- They are a patient in a nursing home due to the loss of mental or physical abilities related to a disability, or
- Their eyesight is limited
Veterans may be eligible for Housebound benefits if they get a VA pension and spend most of their time in their home because of a permanent disability. However, individuals cannot get Aid and Attendance benefits and Housebound benefits at the same time.
If you are caring for a veteran of the United States Armed Forces, make sure that your loved one is receiving the care and benefits they deserve, and that you – as the family caregiver – are getting the respite care you need. Your regional VA benefit office can be a great resource if you have questions about the benefits that are available to you and your family.

378,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/home-cares-effect-on-the-economy/,"With the deadline to raise the debt ceiling getting closer each day, the economy is at the forefront of the minds of many Americans. The home care industry—and family members providing care for their adult loved ones—has a great impact on the economy.
According to a recent report from the AARP Public Policy Institute, the economic impact of home care in 2009 was approximately $450 billion with more than 40 million Americans provided care for an adult family member. Family caregivers face great challenges, balancing jobs with caregiving. In 2009, the average family caregiver was a 49-year-old woman with a full-time job who spent about 20 hours per week on caregiving tasks.
The economic downturn has impacted the industry, which has seen a 67 percent increase in requests for help from caregiver support services from 2007 to 2009. If family caregivers were no longer available, the cost to the U.S. healthcare and long-term services and supports (LTSS) systems would see a great increase. Read more about the economic impact here."
379,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/home-for-the-holidays/,"The holidays are just around the corner and you might be heading home to celebrate the season. This is a perfect opportunity for you to quietly assess how things are going for your aging parents. It is also the ideal occasion for you and your siblings to help them out while you’re all close by. We asked FirstLight Home Care’s Nurse Gina for a list of things she would recommend you check when you’re home. Here’s what she recommended:
- Start with their home: Look around to see if they have bills piling up or mail left unopened. Is this becoming too overwhelming for them? How’s the cleanliness of their home? Is the house more un-kept than usual? If so, this might be a signal of a decrease in thinking skills, vision, or mobility.
- Check out their social life: Find out what they’re doing to stay social with friends. Are they getting out and doing things to keep active? If you find them reluctant to leave the house, this could be a sign that they are having a hard time driving, moving about, seeing, or hearing so they’d rather stay home. This could lead to loneliness and depression. Find out what’s causing them to disengage.
- Let them drive: Okay, this might be scary, but you need to do it. If your parents are still driving, you should let them drive so you can assess their driving skills. Check out their car to see if there are any dents or scratches. By allowing your parents to do some of the driving while you are at home allows you the opportunity to start the discussion about their driving habits. They may need to limit their driving or even stop driving completely.
- Check out what they’re eating: When you open the refrigerator, is it well-stocked with fresh produce and meats or are you seeing signs of a very poor diet and moldy, expired food? When you go out to eat, are they eating less? Are they showing signs of having little interest in food? Do they appear to have lost weight? These could be signs that they are becoming malnourished. A poor diet can intensify chronic diseases, lead to a weakened immune system, and increase the risk of dementia.
- Visit with their doctor: Set up an appointment to meet with their regular physician to discuss their current health condition. Check out their medications to see what they’re taking, how often, and that their pills are not expired. Are they taking more than 5 medications? Can you hold a coherent conversation with them? Do they keep repeating the same story? Confusion, dizziness, and signs of dementia can be caused by medications or taking the wrong combinations of drugs.
We know the holidays are supposed to be happy times with family and friends but if you don’t see your parents frequently and there have been concerns about their general health and wellbeing, the holidays are a perfect time to assess how they’re doing. Once you’ve made your assessment, speak to family members, and even discuss what you’re seeing with your parents. You might not know what to do next because you live too far away to check on them regularly and that is where FirstLight Home Care can help. Our local caregivers are amazing. Our offices offer customized services for your parents based on what they need. We offer Companion Care, Personal Care, Dementia Care, Respite Care, and Travel Companion services to help them live a quality and independent life in their home and to give you peace of mind."
380,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/home-health-care-versus-nursing-home-care/,"Many of our aging parents want to live on their own. According to AARP, more than 95% of seniors want to stay in their home as long as possible, even if they need help with day-to-day activities. After all, home is comfortable and familiar and they are surrounded by memories and circumstances that make them feel safe.
There is no magical age when a senior may need help. There are many 90-year-olds who live at home and need very little help. On the other hand, there are 60 and 70-year olds who find their ability to live independently waning. It’s a hard reality for adult sons and daughters to face: when is it time to become a caregiver yourself, get help in the home, or move your parents to a nursing home or assisted living facility?
Let’s explore the pros and cons of each living situation so you can make an informed decision about what is best.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Home Care
How often we have heard seniors say: “If you move me to a nursing home I will crawl up and die.” The major advantage of home health care is that seniors get to “age in place” among their friends and surroundings that make them feel secure and happy. They can maintain their freedom. The main problems with staying at home is they may need help with cleaning, meal preparation, driving, grooming and other tasks.
However, if seniors need a little help, there are various options available:
- Enlist friends or family. The chore of being a caregiver shouldn’t rest on one person’s shoulders. Enlist family or friends to help with tasks your aging parents find challenging. Many religious communities or organizations have volunteers who can help with driving and preparing nutritious meals. Or you can have meals delivered into the home.
- Hire in–home care. Home health care agencies such as FirstLight Home Care have compassionate caregivers who can come into the home on a part-time, hourly or 24/7 basis. We provide different levels of care, from companion care to personal care to dementia care. This can provide you with peace of mind knowing that someone is there to pinch hit for you. In some cases the home care costs can be reimbursed by Medicare, Veteran’s aid or other sources.
- Remote monitoring. Remote devices are now available for both emergency situations or to remind your loved ones to take their medication. Web based tools are often available so you can know your parent’s schedules and communicate with any caregivers.
If your parents want to stay in their home, make sure it is as safe as possible because falls are quite common. Do a home maintenance checklist to make sure any hazards such as loose rugs are removed. Also, it may be easier if grab bars are installed in bathrooms.
Another advantage of home care costs is it is less expensive than nursing home costs.
Other Senior Care Housing Options
According to a study by Clarity, seniors fear moving into a nursing home more than they fear death, mainly because of the institutional feeling and loss of freedom. However, depending on the level of care that is needed, this may be the only option.
There are many different types of senior homes, all providing different services and levels of care Medicare describes them as follows:
- Group homes or board and care homes. Adults live in a home with 10 – 12 people their own age and get assistance with bathing, dressing, and using the bathroom.
- Subsidized senior housing. If your loved one has a very moderate income, there are federal and state programs that help pay for housing. Additionally, there may be help with meals and other activities like housekeeping, shopping, and doing the laundry. Residents usually live in their own apartments in the complex. Rent payments are usually a percentage of your income (a sliding scale).
- Assisted living facilities generally mean that your loved one has his/her own apartment within a building or a group of buildings, but can get help with meals, transportation, cleaning and social activities. Some of these facilities have health services on site. You pay a monthly fee for rent and utilities and a separate fee for any extras.
- Retirement Communities. The beauty of this type of community is they usually have different living options and progressive levels of care. In other words, you can start out in your own home and progress to skilled nursing care when and if you need it. Many retirement communities charge a large fee before you move in plus a monthly maintenance fee.
- Skilled Nursing Facilities. If your loved one needs 24/7 care, skilled nursing facilities have nurses and doctors on site.
- Hospice Care. Ordinarily for the terminally ill (who have six months or left to live), these facilities primarily make patient’s comfortable and provide counseling for the family. As part of hospice care, you will have a team of doctors, nurses, home health aides, social workers, counselors and trained volunteers to help you and your family cope with your illness. Depending on your condition, you may get hospice care in a hospice facility, hospital, or nursing home.
- Program For All Inclusive Care of the Elderly (PACE). PACE manages all of the medical, social, and long-term care services for frail people to remain in their homes and to maintain their quality of life. PACE is available only in states that have chosen to offer it under Medicaid. To qualify for PACE you must be 55 or older, live in the area they have a PACE program, ad receive certification from your physician that you need nursing home care.
The problem with the services listed above is that unless it’s a government program or you have long-term insurance, this type of care can get expensive.
The most important questions are: How much care do my loved one’s need and how can we meet these needs considering out budget and lifestyles? Then you as a group can best determine what type of long term care would be the best!

381,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/home-modifications-to-support-aging-in-place/,"A 2018 study by AARP revealed that 76% of US residents over the age of 50 would prefer to live in their homes indefinitely as they get older.
It’s easy to empathize with this desire, particularly when you consider how continuity of location can help with staying connected to your loved ones and engaged with your community.
Adapting certain features of your home to make certain daily tasks easier can help seniors maintain their independence longer. Here are a few of the most common home modifications for aging in place.
Converting a tub into a walk-in shower
Reduced mobility in the hips and knees can prevent people from getting into and out of a bathtub. A walk-in shower can allow someone to wash without needing to climb over the edge of the tub.
When converting a shower into a walk-in, it’s important to add design features that reduce the risk of slips and falls. Two ways of doing this are using textured tiles for the bathroom floor and installing handrails on the walls adjacent to portions of the floor that are likely to get wet.
If you do not want to re-tile your floor, a more affordable way of making the bathroom floor slip-resistant is by adding anti-slip flooring strips to your existing tiles.
A typical cost of turning a tub into a walk-in shower is $3000-$8000. This covers the cost of removing the existing tub, creating and laying the shower floor and installing additional glass panels to prevent splashing. If additional plumbing is required, this may push the cost up.
Installing a stairlift
Installing a stairlift is one home modification for someone who has difficulty climbing up and down flights of stairs. While stairlift installations do not usually require any additional remodeling, there are some requirements that a staircase must have for a stairlift to be installed, including:
- Minimum width: Staircases need to be at least 32 inches wide to accommodate a stairlift.
- Nearby power outlet: A plug should be available within 10 feet of either the top or the bottom of the flight of stairs.
- Sufficient space to mount or dismount the chairlift: Landings need to be wide enough to easily get in and out of your chairlift. The amount of space needed to do this will vary from person to person.
Installing a stairlift costs around $3,000-$6,000 per staircase. This price is generally double if a staircase needs to be widened to accommodate the chairlift.
Widening doorways
Widening doorways can make them easier to walk through when using a wheelchair or walking aid. A doorway that is 34 inches wide should be able to accommodate most walking aids.
The cost to widen a doorway can vary a lot, depending on how much it needs to be expanded by and the material of the door and doorway. It can therefore cost anywhere from $500-$3,000.
Adding ramps and rails to the exterior of a home
When adding ramps to paths and steps you essentially have two options. These are:
- Modular ramps: Fixture ramps that are permanently installed in your home’s exterior.
- Portable ramps: These are smaller ramps that are easily removable.
For ramps that are less than three feet long, such as to provide accessibility over one or two small steps, portable ramps should be sufficient. Modular ramps will be needed for longer pathways.
Ramps are priced out by the linear foot. Depending on material, modular ramps can cost between $100-300 per linear foot. Portable ramps can cost as little as $25 per linear foot.
Getting financial aid for home modifications to support aging in place
If you are unsure about whether you can afford necessary modifications for your or a loved one’s home, you have a few options for financial support. These options include:
- State-specific government assistance programs: 27 states have at least one financial assistance program specifically to help fund home modifications for seniors. You can find a list of these, along with eligibility requirements here.
- Rebuilding Together is a non-profit organization that provides no-cost home modifications to assist with aging-in-place. You can get in contact with your local affiliate here
- There are many charities that support veterans with aging in place, including providing financial aid for home modifications. You can find a list of these programs here.

382,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/honor-elderly-veterans-this-memorial-day/,"In the United States, there are over 21 million military veterans, including over 9 million vets aged 65 and over. Since 1966, Memorial Day has been a time to celebrate, honor and remember service members who gave their time, effort and lives to our country. This Memorial Day weekend, honor the veterans in your life by thanking them for their service.
• Spend time with a veteran. If you personally know a veteran, bring him or her dinner or invite him or her to a barbeque to celebrate Memorial Day and honor veterans. If you don’t know a vet, visit a VA hospital or nursing home and spend some time honoring the residents.
• Go to a Memorial Day parade and cheer for young and old veterans! Go as a spectator or volunteer your time to help set up, tear down or manage the event.
• Send a care package to current service members overseas. Pack up much-needed items like toiletries, notebooks and socks, as well as fun treats like candy, snacks, a movie or games. For those with limited time, go through a site like Jollybox (http://www.myjollybox.com/), which will send soldiers monthly pre-made care packages."
383,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/hospice-care/,"It used to be that the term “hospice care” meant you were terminally ill and dying. It was a frightening word whispered under your breath so your parent or loved one didn’t think it was their end-of-life and give up.
At FirstLight Home Care, we have provided hospice care for people who recover and rehabilitate and resume their normal lives. Basically hospice care can mean that dying is a possibility versus a guaranteed reality. Patients can go in and out of hospice care as needed.
What Is Hospice Care?
Hospice is indeed for those who have a limited life expectancy with the physician feeling that death could occur within the next six months. However, hospice care can be provided for longer than six months as long as the person’s doctor and hospice care team certify that the condition remains life-limiting. It’s not about trying to “cure” the disease, such as undergoing life-saving chemotherapy treatments. It’s more about a quality of life – ensuring that the patient is comfortable emotionally, physically and spiritually, and out of pain or distress until the end of life.
Understand that hospice is not always a place – it’s primarily a service although there are facilities dedicated solely to hospice. Hospice is usually conducted in home, or a long-term care facility, assisted living, retirement community, rest home or hospital. Hospice caregivers work to enhance the quality of life that is remaining so patients can be as alert and comfortable as possible in a familiar environment with family and friends. Usually a family member serves as the primary caregiver and a hospice team provides services as needed.
Although we often think of the term hospice care in connection with seniors, hospice can apply to anyone of any age with any illness.
What Services Does Hospice Provide?
Generally, a hospice interdisciplinary team (IDT) can provide a combination of the following services:
- Medical services provided under the care of a physician and nurse.
- Social services to advise families and act as a community advocate.
- Spiritual services provided b y a clergy in your designated religion.
- Home care services provided by home care agencies such as FirstLight to help with bathing, dressing, meal preparation and more.
- Physical, occupational and speech therapy to provide guidance on tasks that may have become cumbersome due to illness such as walking, talking and feeding.
- Respite care to provide your family caregiver with a break.
- Bereavement services to help surviving family members cope with the death of a loved one
Who Pays For Hospice?
If the patient has Medicare and meets the criteria for hospice, Medicare pays 100% of the costs with no deductible or co-payment. Even medical supplies, equipment and prescriptions are covered during this time. Individuals who are not on Medicare must talk to their private insurance company to see what is covered. Medicaid payments vary by state and The Department of Veteran Affairs covers hospice costs as well.
For hospice to be covered under Medicare, a physician must evaluate the patient and determine that he/she has less than six months to live if the illness is left to run its course. Patients must sign a statement choosing hospice care instead of other Medicare benefits and receive care from a Medicare hospice approved hospice program. For more guidelines on Medicare coverage refer to Medicare Hospice Benefits.
How FirstLight Home Care Helps With Hospice Care
At FirstLight Home Care, our hospice services focus on compassionate care versus cure. Our caregivers work in tandem with physicians, social workers, nurses, and occupational and physical therapists to ensure patients are comfortable and peaceful and get the medical and physical support that is needed. If patients recover, we are elated! If not, we provide the assistance both patients and families need to have a comfortable quality of life when the length of life is limited.
Patients don’t need their last days to be in the cold, sterile environment of a hospital, preferring instead to be around family and friends that you love. At FirstLight Home Care, we make sure your loved ones last days are filled with love, dignity, purpose and support."
384,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/hospitals-need-to-revamp-to-cater-to-aging-population/,"According to a recent article on USA Today’s website, an astonishing one-third of hospital patients older than 70 leave more frail than when they arrived. Further research shows that even after they are released, nursing home care or rehabilitation can be necessary. The elder care experts quoted in the article believe that this is a result of “conventional hospital care focusing on treating disease rather than preventing frailty.”
So what can be done to help better the quality of care our elderly are receiving? Many hospitals have implemented walking programs to help get the seniors out of bed and moving—a simple form of light exercise that really benefits seniors who are recovering from illness. Offering better food and more comfortable surroundings are also actions that are being implemented in hospitals across the country but have been slow to catch on everywhere.
Of course, hiring a professional caregiver like the ones employed at FirstLight Home Care can really benefit a senior recovering from a minor or serious illness. Caregivers can be hired on an hourly basis so that helps to keep costs down.

385,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/hot-weather-safety-tips-older-adults/,"Extremely hot weather is in the forecast for many parts of the country. If you have older family members or elderly neighbors living nearby, it is important to make sure that, as temperatures rise, they are protected from the extreme heat.
Here are some great hot weather safety tips that the elderly, as well as their caregivers, can follow to make sure they stay cool and hydrated during these hot summer months.
- Drink plenty of cool water throughout the day and avoid alcohol and caffeine. Dehydration is the root of many heat-related health problems.
- Eat cooling, hydrating snacks like popsicles, watermelon or slightly frozen grapes.
- Eat light, cold meals like chicken or pasta salad.
- Stay indoors during mid-day hours.
- Place a cool washcloth on the back of the neck and a pan of cool water close by to periodically re-cool the towel.
- Sit with feet in a pan of cool (not ice cold) water.
- Run errands or schedule appointments either before 10am or after 6pm, when the temperature tends to be cooler.
- Keep the house as cool as possible by keeping shades closed during the hottest part of the day.
- Wear layers of lightweight clothing in light-colored cotton so it’s easy to adjust to your temperature by removing or adding clothing throughout the day.
- Check with your doctor or pharmacist to make sure any medications you are taking won’t be affected by higher temperatures — especially if you don’t have air conditioning in your home. Some medications are less effective if stored at temperatures higher than room temperature (approximately 78 degrees Fahrenheit),
- Don’t overdo it. Avoid exercise and strenuous activity during extreme heat.
- Get to know your elderly neighbors. As the temperature rises, check in on them occasionally to make sure everything is all right.
- Seek public places with air conditioning. Enjoy time at a local recreation center, senior center, library, coffee shop, or shopping mall.
- Protect your eyes from harmful UV rays by wearing sunglasses. Too much exposure to the sun can irritate eyes.
- If you get overheated, take a cool shower, bath, or washcloth wipe-down.
- Know the warning signs of heat-related illness. Dizziness, nausea, headache, rapid heartbeat, chest pain, fainting and breathing problems are all warning signs that help should be sought immediately.

386,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-can-caregivers-practice-self-care/,"Self-care is any activity that we do purposefully in order to take care of our emotional and physical health.
It is a broad concept that incorporates nutrition, lifestyle, physical activities, and personal awareness, to name a few. Self-care is a way for our bodies to refuel. Make no mistake…it is not a selfish act. Good self-care is key to improving mood, reducing anxiety and maintaining a good relationship with oneself and others.
Practicing self-care isn’t always easy. Most people, especially family caregivers, have busy schedules managing the care of a loved one and the needs of their family, friends, and employers. Typically, the caregiver puts themselves last and, when they do take time to focus on their own needs, they tend to feel guilty.
It is important to carve out time for yourself every now and then. Here are 7 ways to get started with your self-care.
Do something you enjoy every day. Engaging in a hobby has been shown to reduce stress and it can even activate genes that increase immunity and decrease inflammation.
Find ways to relax. Start with your breathing. When stressed, breathing is usually flat, short and labored. Our breath goes into our upper chest or shoulders and this type of breathing increases tension. Focus on deeper, slower breaths. In this type of diaphragm breathing, the stomach pushes out as the breath goes in, creating a calming effect.
Keep a gratitude journal. Allocate time (as little as 10 minutes) each day to write down all the things that you’re thankful for, or simply use the opportunity to jot down whatever is on your mind. As you write, mentally release those things onto the page to help clear your head.
Stay connected to others. Carve out an hour each week to be with someone who you love. If they’re far away, give them a phone call.
Ask for help. Big or small, ask family and friends to help you so that you can find time for yourself.
Exercise daily. Being active can help you both physically and mentally. Exercise can boost your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, not to mention help you shed extra weight.
Unplug for an hour. Go on a media and technology fast and turn off any unnecessary electronic devices, even if it’s just for an hour a day. Unplug and enjoy the stillness of your space.
Today is the day you start making you a priority. What is one thing you can do to practice self-care? Share as a comment here or join the conversation on our Facebook page.
In November, we celebrate National Home Care and Family Caregivers Month, observances that are near and dear to us.

387,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-can-i-age-healthier/,"It’s September. That means that this month is Healthy Aging Month, designed to help promote the positive aspects of growing older. Healthy Aging Month encourages individuals to take responsibility for their own physical, mental, social and financial health. Health is extremely important at any stage in life, but becomes even more essential as you begin to age. So, what can you do to take advantage of Healthy Aging Month?
Head back to school. You are never done learning and, what better way to improve your mental health than expanding your knowledge? Take courses at a local college or university; you may not even have to attend class with the addition of many online courses.
Do something physical. Many older adults think that exercise has to be boring and done in a gym. But, they’re wrong! Activities like dancing, swimming, golfing and walking are all excellent options for low-impact physical exercise to increase oxygen to the brain and to get your heart pumping.
Get out of town. Take some time to plan a trip to somewhere you’ve never been before. Traveling is a great way to revitalize your mental health and also allows you to go to new places and learn new things. Immerse yourself in a new culture and get away for a while.
Figure out finances. Make an appointment with a financial advisor to review your financials. Go over your current finances and talk about your long-term monetary goals. This is the perfect time to go back through your investments and possibly make some changes.
Find your passion. This month is about revitalization. Reconnect with a hobby or activity that you used to really

388,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-can-you-celebrate-national-senior-citizens-day/,"On August 19, 1988 President Ronald Reagan proclaimed August 21 as National Senior Citizens Day, a day to recognize and show appreciation for the value and contribution of elderly people to the family and society as a whole. In the Proclamation, he said “For all they have achieved throughout life and for all they continue to accomplish, we owe older citizens our thanks and a heartfelt salute. We can best demonstrate our gratitude and esteem by making sure that our communities are good places in which to mature and grow older—places in which older people can participate to the fullest and can find the encouragement, acceptance, assistance, and services they need to continue to lead lives of independence and dignity.”
So, how can you celebrate National Senior Citizens Day with your elderly loved one? Take some time today to show your gratitude for the seniors in your life.
1. Spend time with a senior citizen. This could be a parent, grandparent, neighbor or friend. Let them know how much you appreciate and respect them. Visit them at their homes, play board games or even read their favorite novel to them.
2. Do something fun. Get them out of the house, moving around and having a good time! Take them to a park, a museum, the matinee show at the movies, out to lunch or even to the mall. Make today a special occasion—it’s their day after all! Do something that they enjoy and they’ll remember that small surprise for years to come.
3. Help with chores and errands. Spend some time today helping them around the house of with errands that need to be taken care of. It may seem like a small contribution, but they will be appreciative of your offer to help them out. Do whatever they need done like laundry, washing the dishes, going to pick up their prescriptions or even going grocery shopping.
4. Share stories and memories. Sometimes the best part about spending time with the older generation is listening to the stories and memories that they have to share. Today, allow them to take a trip down memory lane and listen to the stories and accounts of what life was like for them in their past. You never know, you may learn something about them that you didn’t know before!
5. Make plans to volunteer. Just because today is the only National Senior Citizens Day, that doesn’t mean that you can’t help on other days. Sign up to volunteer at a senior living facility sometime this year. Volunteering allows you to spend time with seniors, especially those that aren’t visited often by family members."

Recent news of the virus starting to spread in the U.S. is unsettling. While it’s natural to worry and wonder what could happen if the spread of the virus gets worse, it’s also important not to panic… but instead to be armed with helpful information from the experts.
Of course, we at FirstLight Home Care are deeply committed to the health, safety and well-being of all our clients, families, caregivers and staff. Our goal is always to be prepared and take the proper precautions. We do have policies and protocols in place to ensure that the people caring for our clients and their families are prepared, not panicked.

That may sound strange to some of you but even as an individual is progressing through the dementia stages they do retain certain parts of their personality. Now, sometimes the subtle changes can occur before an illness such as a urinary tract infection or even dehydration. So I started this morning with running through the gamut of potential problems. Beginning with the small things such as the lighting being adequate, is she warm enough, does she have her hearing aids in place and are they turned up so she can hear me. I then moved on to what I call the intermediate of potential issues, such as did she take her medications last night and today, did she seem stuffy or congested this morning, had she had a bowel movement yesterday, or did her unusually quiet behavior reflect something else. She seemed tired and when she asked what time it was, it hit me; last night was the shift to Daylight Savings Time.
Now you would not expect this to create any problems for someone who is not cognitively aware of the time of day any longer; but just like a baby or child, the individual with Alzheimer’s has a sense something is different. We did not necessarily get her up an hour earlier or make any changes to her routine but she sensed a change. She asked repeatedly during the day what time it was and finally said she felt tired today. There are times when she is such a “hoot”! Her surprised reaction when we told her the time was, “Oh my, how could I have slept so long.” And when we all laugh, she laughs and enjoys herself right along with the rest of us, it is wonderful. I love to see her have those happy moments.
Meals were the epicenter of her confusion with Day Light Savings time; she just couldn’t believe it was time to eat again. This made us all laugh again since Martha is a very tiny woman who weighs about 98 pounds but eats constantly. Around our house we have candy dishes filled with her favorite “Hershey Kisses” along with bowls of unsalted pecans, almonds and fruit. Needless to say, she does not go hungry. However, today her eating pattern has shifted and instead of eating all of those treats between meals, she is eating them about an hour later. Our grandchildren came over and she helped fix tacos, salad and brownies for dinner and guess who ate her weight in brownies? It is wonderful to watch how animated she becomes when around children. You can see she is back to raising her daughter and five boys; her old behaviors to keep them busy kick in.
Once dinner was over and as the sun went down she began to become restless and uncomfortable; not unusual for most people with dementia. Martha rubs her hands together when she is unsettled which helps by giving us an indicator to her state of mind. Her bright blue eyes begin to fade. She asks my husband to take her home which we finally figured out to mean Tennessee, where she grew up with “Momma and Daddy”. Then she wants to know if the lady of the house cares if she goes to bed. She and I walk together upstairs to begin her bedtime routine and she says to me that she is so tired and the day has gone by so fast. I agree and to some degree am always surprised at how much she continues to teach me every day about those living with dementia."

As a family caregiver, you tend to be primarily focused on your loved one, and you don’t always realize that your own health and well-being could be suffering.
It’s important that you watch for these common signs of caregiver stress:
- Feeling overwhelmed or constantly worried
- Feeling tired often
- Getting too much (or not enough) sleep
- Drastic changes in weight
- Becoming easily irritated or angry
- Losing interest in activities you used to enjoy
- Feeling sad much of the time
- Having frequent headaches or other physical pains
- Abusing alcohol or drugs, including prescription medications
Studies have shown that family caregivers are more likely to experience symptoms of depression or anxiety. Too much stress, especially over a long period of time, can harm your health. This stress and feelings of being overwhelmed can impact your quality of sleep, levels of physical activity, and/or your diet — which increases your risk of medical problems, such as heart disease and diabetes.
When you’re constantly worried about someone else, you don’t always spot what’s happening with your own emotional and physical well-being. It is important to recognize the caregiver stress you are feeling and address it early to help prevent future health problems. By caring for yourself you will, in turn, take better care of your loved one and enjoy your life as a family caregiver.
Here are some tips to help you prevent or manage caregiver stress:
- Learn ways to better help your loved one. For example, some senior centers and hospitals offer classes that educate you on how to care for someone with an injury or chronic illness. To find these classes, ask your doctor.
- Find caregiving resources in your community to help you with your companion care and personal care responsibilities. Many communities have adult daycare services or respite services to give primary caregivers a break from their daily caregiving duties.
- Ask for and accept help. Make a list of ways others can assist you. Let family members choose how they can jump in and help. For instance, someone might sit with the person you care for while you run an errand. Someone else might pick up groceries for you. If family and friends are not available, investigate services, like FirstLight Home Care’s Companion Care program to help with light housekeeping and laundry, grocery shopping, meal preparation, errands, transportation and more.
- Join a support group for caregivers. You can find general family caregiver support groups or groups of caregivers who care for someone with the same illness or disability as your loved one. You can share stories, pick up caregiving tips, and get support from others who may face the same challenges as you.
- Get organized. Make to-do lists and set a routine to help you accomplish your daily goals.
- Take time for yourself. Stay in touch with family and friends and continue to do the things you enjoy. It’s important to take breaks. Respite care allows you to take some time off from your responsibilities as a primary caregiver so you can focus on yourself for a while. While you’re away, professional caregivers are there to make sure your loved one is taken care of, even if it’s just for a few hours.
- Take care of your health. Find time to be physically active most days of the week, choose healthy foods, and get plenty of sleep.
- See your doctor for regular checkups. Regular wellness visits can help prevent future health problems, so make sure you are seeing your own doctor as well. Tell your doctor or nurse you are a caregiver and share with them the potential stress you are experiencing.
If you’re like many caregivers, asking your family and friends to help can be difficult. Unfortunately, not asking can lead to feeling isolated, frustrated and even depressed. Don’t struggle on your own, take advantage of our local FirstLight Home Care caregivers. They are here to help you with the care of your loved one and you.

392,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-does-alzheimers-affect-the-family-caregiver/,"The impact of caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s has a ripple effect on the entire family and their network of friends, but most likely the biggest effect is on the family caregiver.
The impact Alzheimer’s disease has on caregivers can lead to a variety of emotions, from guilt to anger, as well as influence their own physical and financial well-being. The most common effects include:
Increased Risk of Physical Illness: A recent study conducted by the Mayo Clinic uncovered that family caregivers report a greater number of physical health problems and worse overall health compared with non-caregivers. Family caregivers are at increased risk of various problems, including:
- cardiovascular problems
- lower immunity
- poor sleep patterns
- slower wound healing
- higher levels of chronic conditions such as diabetes, arthritis, ulcers, and anemia
Growing Financial Challenges: Costs associated with caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease are high. Direct costs include physician care, medical tests, medication, and personal nursing care. Indirect costs include loss of earnings by family caregivers as they relinquish or reduce employment and paid hours out of choice or necessity.
Diminished Emotional Well-Being: Levels of psychological distress are significantly higher in Alzheimer’s or other dementia-related caregivers than in other types of caregivers and non-caregivers. Caregiver stress can result in serious psychological problems, including depression and anxiety that should be treated immediately. Learn more about the symptoms of caregiver burnout.
Increasing Social Isolation: Family caregivers often lack social contact and support and, as a result, experience feelings of social isolation. They tend to sacrifice their own leisure pursuits and hobbies, reduce time with friends and family, and give up or reduce employment in order to devote time to their loved one.
Too much stress over long periods of time can be harmful to both the caregiver and the person in his or her care. Here are some caregiver stress management tips that we’ve shared previously that are still very useful.
- Identify the community resources that are in your area and take advantage of their services. Adult day programs, in-home care assistance, and meal delivery are some services that can help you manage daily tasks.
- Include physical exercise into your own daily routine. Exercise can help reduce stress and improve your overall well–being.
- Carve out time for yourself. Take advantage of respite care so you can take a break to refresh and spend time doing something you enjoy.
- Take care of yourself. Visit your doctor regularly. Try to eat well, exercise and get plenty of rest. Making sure that you are healthy can help you be a better caregiver.

393,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-dogs-can-positively-impact-the-elderly/,"When my Mom turned 60-years-old, I asked her what she wanted for this special birthday. I figured maybe she would want a trip or have all the kids and grandkids fly home. Her answer floored me: a dog.
My Mom and Dad had dogs when they were children, but I was allergic to pets. It had been 40 years since my parents had a dog, and I was a little afraid whether it would be too overwhelming for them. After all, dogs require a lot of attention, love and training. Would my Dad really want to get up and walk the dog? Would my meticulous Mom be okay if the dog had an accident in the house?
Turns out, it was the best remedy for their empty nest syndrome I could have ever imagined. I went to the local shelter and picked out a dog that was already mature, so they wouldn’t have to go through the rigors of training. I also picked out a small dog – a Maltese – knowing my parents wanted a “lap dog” versus a larger dog. As Chicago veterinarian Tony Kremer said: “these pets go from the pound to paradise.”
My parents are not alone. Studies have been conducted citing the benefits of pets to the elderly both for their health and their energy. Here are some of the many advantages a dog can bring to your elderly loved one:
- Love. With the house empty of kids, my Mom needed someone or something to heap all her love and attention towards and fuss over. Sure enough, that dog went everywhere with her. Since we were no longer home to eat her homemade treats, she learned to make the dog organic treats that were actually healthy! My parents loved their dog unconditionally and he loved them unconditionally in return.
- Loneliness. Because my parents could not keep up the pace they used to, they had more free time on their hands. Too much leisure time can cause many seniors to get lonely and depressed. As my dad battled prostate cancer, that dog was right up on the bed keeping him company and comforting after his grueling treatments. Dogs seems to “sense” when their owners have the blues.
- Active. Although my Mom didn’t like “formal exercise”, her and my Dad would go on long walks with the dog. This kept them all mobile and moving, which was great for their physical health. Plus, this gave them a chance to socialize with all their neighbors who had pets and helped them meet new people.
- Confidence. As my Mom aged, she was always afraid of her “forgetfulness”. As I reminded her, she never, ever forgot to feed and bathe the dog! The dog kept her mentally sharp.
- Security. If any stranger came into the house, the dog would start barking. He served as a great burglar alarm, which gave my parents a feeling of security.
In fact, studies have shown that pets keep seniors 21% healthier, by using less medicine, visiting their doctor less, lowering their blood pressure, and increasing their mental acuity.
I can tell you this. Although most dog experts say you should let the dog owner pick out the dog himself, my Mom chose the breed and I hit a home run with the temperament.
If your parents are lonely, consider the benefits of having a dog."
394,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-far-would-you-go-to-help-someone-in-need/,"A touching story hit the media this week about a 101-year old woman in Detroit who was evicted from her home by a HUD foreclosure in September. Sadly, the elderly woman, Texana Hollis, was left outside in her wheelchair with her few belongings in a trash receptacle. Hollis has since been living with a long-time friend but news of the eviction travelled quickly. Concerned community members have started a fund for her and donations are pouring in. A contracting company is even building a wheelchair ramp for Hollis where she is currently staying.
Unfortunately, Hollis’ scenario happens all too often within the senior community. Some studies have reported that up to 20 percent of seniors live on an average income of $7500 a year and with rising healthcare and long-term care costs, this leaves many elderly in a disadvantageous position.
Mark Onderko, owner of FirstLight Home Care in Austin, Texas, recently dealt with a similar situation with a senior client who was essentially abandoned by her family after being discharged from a local nursing home. Mark compassionately provided this woman with the help that she desperately needed, free of charge. This exemplifies how FirstLight owners serve and make a difference in their community every day.
It’s reassuring to know that amidst the negative news we are bombarded with every day, there are still people eager to do the right thing and lend a helping hand."
395,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-home-care-can-help-adults-with-disabilities/,"Non-medical home care can be a lifeline for not just seniors but for younger adults who have disabilities, whether cognitive or physical. Any adult with cognitive decline, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, vision impairment, multiple sclerosis and more could benefit from in-home support.
Disability care services that support family caregivers and care for loved ones with chronic or specialized conditions can help families face the challenges in their daily lives by providing Companion Care, Personal Care, and even Respite Care to offer the family caregiver a much-needed break to take care of themselves and their needs.
Here are a few ways that home care services help adults with disabilities:
Mobility: If a person’s disability impacts their mobility, this can have serious consequences, dramatically altering their quality of life. Mobility issues can also cause falls, which is the fifth largest cause of death in the elderly (SOURCE: American Society on Aging). FirstLight caregivers understand the physical and emotional benefits that regular movement can provide, and they can assist with walking, climbing stairs and helping individuals navigate while at home or out in the community.
Personal Hygiene: Most adults with disabilities can learn to maintain basic hygiene with proper education and support – but performing these essential tasks can be challenging. In-home personal caregivers are specially trained in bathing, dressing, personal hygiene, and other personal care services that focus on preserving the dignity, comfort and health of each client.
Grocery Shopping and Meal Prep: Getting groceries is a common need for adults with disabilities who wish to maintain independence at home. Professional caregivers can help your loved one get the grocery items they need, as well as help them prepare regular meals that maintain a healthy diet, provide sufficient nutrition, and simply add joy and comfort to their day!
Physical Activity and Exercise: Physical activity and exercise can help adults with disabilities achieve their mental and physical potential. Bowling, exercise classes, gardening, team sports, dancing and swimming are all activities that can be used to promote good holistic health while having fun. Daily activity can also help those with limited mobility. FirstLight caregivers can assist (and oftentimes participate in) various physical activities and other hobbies with an adult with disabilities.
Transportation: Having help and support getting around town for both emergency and everyday needs is beneficial to an adult with a disability. Companion caregivers can provide these services directly, including shopping at specific stores for a client’s favorite or needed items or taking them to and from doctor appointments. They can also provide incidental transportation for clients who would like to run errands and socialize, all while ensuring the client’s well-being.
Disabilities can happen at any age due to illness, injury, or a genetic condition. In many cases, persons with disabilities require assistance with daily routines, such as bathing, dressing and household chores, as well as meal preparation, shopping, and getting around their house or local community.
The caregivers at FirstLight Home Care can provide companionship and personal care services for you and your loved one living with a disability. Contact us for more information on how FirstLight’s in-home services can help adults with disabilities.
FirstLight Home Care is proud to CHAMPION the family caregiver, offering empathy, advice, and support for those who provide countless hours of care to their loved ones living with Alzheimer’s. We want to provide a helping hand, relieve some of the stress that comes with caregiving, and give you back a few hours in your overwhelmingly busy day."
396,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-respite-care-can-bring-relief/,"Caring for a loved one can be incredibly rewarding. It can also be enormously challenging. After all, you’re wearing a lot of hats: daughter or son, assistant, shopper, housekeeper, cook and more. It’s why more than one-third of family caregivers say their job is highly stressful emotionally, according to AARP. It’s also where respite care can help.
Respite Care, Defined
Respite care is simply providing support for a family caregiver for a short-term period of time. The purpose is to give you a break so that you can get some time to yourself and take care of your own personal needs. It can come from many places. For instance, other family members and friends can serve as a source of respite care, as can volunteer groups, faith-based organizations, government agencies and professional caregivers. Respite care can take place whether your loved one is at home or if they reside in a nursing home or long-term care setting.
Ways Respite Care can Help
Respite care can help both you and your loved one in a range of ways. For you, it can provide the chance to relax or spend time with other family and friends. You’ll also have the freedom and flexibility to take care of tasks like running errands or going to that doctors appointment you’ve been putting off. It can provide support and offer peace of mind when you have a trusted caregiver spending time with your loved one.
For your loved one, it can give them an opportunity to meet and interact with others, keeping them engaged while still in a safe and supportive environment. If you’re able to find a caregiver with a similar interest or hobby, they can participate in it together, improving your loved one’s quality of life in the process.
Finding the Right Support
To get the most from respite care, you have to find the right source. When you’re looking, take into account a few factors, including:
- Your needs. Do you need respite care a few hours a day, one day each week, or simply as-needed when you require a break? Get specific and make a list of the number of hours or days of the week when you’d like coverage.
- Your loved one’s needs. This includes their physical condition and how much mobility assistance they require. You must also consider the different areas where they need help, whether it’s companionship, meal preparation, laundry, light housekeeping or medication reminders. To find the right match, look for caregivers who can make your loved one feel safe and comfortable while meeting their needs.
- The best source of help. If you’re simply interested in an occasional afternoon off, then make a short list of family and friends you can contact. You should do this ahead of time, before an emergency arises, so you have options to choose from. If, however, you have regular respite care needs or your loved one requires more extensive assistance due to their condition, consider professionals instead.
Dealing with Obstacles to Respite Care
If you’re the primary caregiver and ready for a break, your next step should be to make a plan with your family. Connect with them and schedule a time and place to meet to discuss your loved one’s care. When you get together, approach the conversation carefully and explain the situation so that other family members understand where you are today… how often are you providing care, what kinds of activities are you commonly doing, what kind of help does your loved one require. Don’t assume they automatically know your needs or those of your loved one.
Discuss the level of care your loved one regularly requires and ask about ways your family can help. Offer options, such as certain days of the week or shifts, perhaps mornings or afternoons. If a family member is unable to commit time, ask them to contribute money for a professional respite caregiver.
Be flexible and understanding when family members have concerns with tasks such as bathing or dressing and instead opt to hire a professional caregiver for those responsibilities.
While you might have feelings of guilt at first, you truly can’t do it all. Getting help is not a sign of weakness, but a way to support and benefit both you and your loved one.
Hiring Professionals to Deliver Respite Care
Being a caregiver is not only stressful, but taxing on your family dynamic. It can even lead to fractured relationships as burnout and frustration escalate over time. If this is happening to you, there is relief in the form of respite care. You simply have to find the right source.
If you’re interested in professional help, make sure you research each company and ask questions about caregiver training and certification. While it might take some time upfront, you’ll be able to breathe easier when you have the respite care you need.

397,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-sandwich-generation-caregivers-can-manage-stress/,"Are you part of the sandwich generation? You know, those adults who are “sandwiched” between their elderly parents and their own children.
Sandwich generation caregivers are made up of people who are caring for their aging parents while also supporting their own children.
- This generation typically includes people in their 40s, 50s and sometimes 60s.
- Most of these individuals work outside the home.
- It is predominantly women who take on this caregiving role.
- The majority struggle to balance the demands that come from caring for so many.
According to a 2017 Pew research report, nearly half of those aged 40 to 60 who are caring for both their elderly parents and their children report extreme levels of stress. This stress takes a toll not only on personal relationships — 83 percent say relationships with their spouse, children and family are the top source of their stress — but also on their own well-being as they struggle to take better care of themselves.
Here are a few things sandwich generation caregivers can do to balance the tasks and manage the stress of caring for an aging parent while also caring for their own families.
- Hold weekly family meetings: Bring everyone together to discuss the family activities that are happening that week (and beyond). Plan out what needs to be accomplished and discuss each person’s responsibilities to chip in and help. Use this regular family meeting to improve communication and allow family members the opportunity to share their thoughts and feelings without negative consequences.
- Get organized: There are only so many hours in the day and only so much time in which to give your attention to everyone who needs it. It’s important that you’re organized. Keep a calendar so that everyone can add their activities, appointments and events, especially those that need your extra attention (check your app store for shared family calendars that you can download). Make lists of daily tasks that need to be completed, and by whom, to ensure everything gets done. If the list becomes too long and too overwhelming, keep reading…
- Seek help from outside the family: Asking for help and support from friends and family can improve your ability to persevere during stressful times. However, that might only be a short-term solution.
If the stress and demands are still too much and you need additional help, you have options. FirstLight Home Care and our professional in-home caregivers are known for our companion and personal care that can help with your aging parents, but did you know that we also provide home care services for busy families? As hard-working parents juggling many responsibilities, sometimes you just need a little extra assistance with the day-to-day. We can customize a solution just for you. Our local caregivers can help you with many including:
- Running errands, such as picking up dry cleaning and prescriptions
- Laundry and light housekeeping
- Grocery shopping, meal planning and meal preparation
- Transportation to and from doctors’ appointments
- Organizing mail and paperwork
- Find healthy ways to manage stress: Consider healthy, stress-reducing activities — taking a short walk, practicing meditation or talking things out with friends or a support group. Keep in mind that unhealthy behaviors develop over time and can be difficult to change. Recognize your stressors and focus on changing one behavior at a time.
- Take care of yourself: Self-care is very important when the demands of caregiving become too much. Eat right, get enough sleep, drink plenty of water and engage in regular physical activity like walking, yoga, or swimming. Stay social and keep in contact with your friends and family members. These are some of our favorite ways to deal with caregiver stress.
No matter how hectic life gets, you need to take care of yourself — so that you have the mental and physical energy to care for both your parents and your children.

398,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-technology-is-changing-the-lives-of-seniors/,"Seniors and technology have long seemed to mix like oil and water. The joke that technology is too new, complicated, and confusing for aging adults has been played out in every comic, sitcom, and movie for decades; however, the notion that technology is only for kids could not be less true.
Yes, seniors may not spend every waking moment on Facebook like their younger counterparts, but integrating technology into their lives can be very beneficial. Now, more than ever, technology is being made available to aging adults to help them live better, (and believe it or not) more simple lives. Below is a list of some of the benefits that incorporating technology can have in the lives of seniors.
Exercise
Exercise is vital to the health of aging of seniors. The problem is that poor weather, lack of
time, and confusion in direction makes getting proper exercise very difficult for most seniors. However, new technology has been released that not only makes exercising easier for aging adults, it also makes it more fun! New video game systems like Wii Fit and XBOX Kinect are helping seniors stay active in the comfort of their own homes. These video game systems have a variety of games that are controlled solely by the player’s body and allow for people of all fitness levels to get involved. This means that you can have fun playing video games while getting the benefits of working out at the same time.
Social Networking
Social networking has become one of the most common tools for people to stay connected with friends and family around the world. Today, seniors are beginning to get more comfortable with social networking sites and video chatting services for these same reasons. Although the common belief is that social networking sites like Facebook are just for kids, the reality is that people of all ages are using the site, even seniors. Each day, these sites are becoming more accessible to users of all ages making social networking a great way to stay in touch online. Plus, most of these sites and services are free!
Medication Management
Medication management has been made easy with the introduction of technology. Forgetting to take medication is a common problem for seniors, and although tried and true methods like weekly pill containers are great, new technology has made medication management and health safety easier than ever. These technological aides often come in the form of smartphone apps, and include medication reminders, refill reminders, and medication descriptions. These apps prevent seniors from mixing medications that might be harmful as well as help reduce the probability of forgetting to take medications.
Safety
Technology can play a vital role in the safety of the elderly, especially when they live alone at home. Falls are very common for aging adults, and when falls occur they often cannot reach a phone to call for help. Now, the simple click of a button can bring medical assistance right to their home faster than ever before. Better yet, homes can also be equipped with devices that detect unhealthy levels of smoke, gas, or other harmful chemicals and alert authorities if needed. The introduction of technology into the homes of aging adults can help reduce the probability of serious injury or death."
399,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-temporary-in-home-care-helps-families/,"Temporary in-home care can help individuals who are recovering from illness, injury or surgery, as well as after a hospital stay.
This short-term care can last anywhere from several weeks to a few months, and it is typically provided in someone’s home. This care may include unskilled or skilled care for the elderly, veterans or people with disabilities.
Unskilled or non-medical home care assists people with activities of daily living as well as basic tasks around the home, such as these companion care services:
- Regular visits, conversations and company
- Medication reminders
- Light housekeeping
- Grocery shopping
- Meal preparation
- Laundry services
- Shopping, running errands and transportation
It can also include family respite care, which gives family caregivers a temporary break from their caregiving responsibilities. Primary caregivers often need extra support taking care of a loved one so that they can not only tend to their own personal needs, such as errands and appointments but so that they can also take time for themselves and practice self-care.
Sometimes personal care services are needed as well. This type of care can assist with everyday activities such as bathing, mobility and personal hygiene.
Skilled care is a little different in that it is typically ordered by a doctor, and it refers to skilled nursing or rehabilitation services that are provided by licensed health professionals like nurses and physical therapists. This care can include:
- Medication management
- Wound care
- Monitoring vital signs
- Catheter and ostomy care
- Providing physical therapy
Temporary in-home care can provide vital support during what can be a challenging and stressful time for individuals and their family caregivers. And while the support of a professional caregiver during this time may be temporary, the impact can be more enduring.
Home care can provide a long-term boost to what your loved one needs most – comfort, confidence and peace of mind. The great thing about services from FirstLight is that we can customize a care plan to fit the needs of your family.

400,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-to-avoid-caregiver-stress-tips-tricks/,"It can be overwhelming to take care of a loved one who is aging or living with cognitive problems or a disability. Too much stress can be harmful to you and to the one in your care. It’s important to recognize the signs of caregiver stress and put actions in place to manage and reduce your stress to avoid caregiver stress syndrome.
What Are The Signs Of Caregiver Stress
As a family caregiver, you are “on call” almost all the time. This ongoing demand can make you so focused on the loved one in your care, that you forget about yourself. This can lead to caregiver stress. You put your own health and well-being on the backburner to take care of them and their everyday needs. If you are suffering from caregiver stress syndrome, you can’t provide the proper care to your loved ones.
How Caregiver Stress Manifests
Stress from caregiving can sneak up on you. It’s important to keep watch for these signs of caregiver stress:
• Feeling overwhelmed or constantly worried
• Feeling tired often
• Getting too much sleep or not enough sleep
• Gaining or losing weight
• Becoming easily irritated or angry
• Losing interest in activities you used to enjoy
• Feeling sad for no reason
• Having frequent headaches, bodily pain or other physical problems
• Abusing alcohol or drugs, including prescription medications
How To Deal With Caregiver Stress
Accept help.
Make a list of the ways family and friends can help you and let them choose what they would like to do. Be specific and let them know the days and times that you could use their help.
Set daily goals.
Having a laundry list of tasks that must get done each week can be overwhelming. Break down your week into daily goals and then prioritize, make lists and establish a daily routine.
Exercise regularly.
Schedule time each day to do some type of physical activity. Not only will it help you stay fit, but exercise is also a stress reliever. Being active can boost your feel- good endorphins and distract you from daily worries.
Eat a healthy, balanced diet.
Unhealthy eating patterns can cause stress levels to skyrocket and potentially increase your risk of health problems in the future. Being stressed can increase your need for certain nutrients, such as vitamin C, vitamin, B, selenium (an antioxidant that fights oxidative stress and helps defend the body from chronic diseases) and magnesium. A well-balanced and nutritious diet is one of the most important ingredients for good health.
Get plenty of sleep.
Not getting quality sleep over a long period of time can cause health issues. If you have trouble getting a good night’s sleep, talk to your doctor.
Join a support group.
If you’re feeling alone and overwhelmed, finding a local support group can provide connection and interaction, as well as problem-solving strategies for difficult situations. The people in support groups will be nonjudgmental to your situation. They understand what you may be going through and can provide counsel, support and even friendship.
Take a well-deserved break.
Everyone needs time away to relieve stress and restore energy. And, let’s face it…taking personal time for yourself can do a world of good! Hiring an outside source to offer support with respite care—from a few hours each week to several days—can allow family caregivers to step away from caregiving responsibilities and take care of themselves. Respite care is an essential part of being a caregiver.
Keep your doctor appointments.
Studies have shown that caregivers are likely to suffer from several health problems. Make it a priority to see your doctor regularly to discuss any concerns or symptoms you have.
Why Is Stress Management Important – Caregiver Stress Syndrome
Family caregivers face a lot of stress. Many work full-time jobs and raise their own families on top of the responsibilities of looking after their aging parents. The demands of the job can take both a physical and mental toll on even the most resilient people, leaving them drained and exhausted. This can lead to caregiver stress syndrome In order to be more patient and available, it’s important to keep caregiver stress within manageable boundaries. These tips reveal why it’s important for family caregivers to lower their stress levels and how to do so every day.
Why is stress bad?
While a little stress is natural, too much can cause long-term problems. Developing caregiver stress by prolonged exposure to stressful situations can
leave caregivers more vulnerable to developing health issues. It can raise your blood pressure, lower the strength of your immune system and lead to long-term diseases like heart disease or stroke. This demanding lifestyle can also interrupt sleep while causing irritability and headaches. Certain caregivers are at an exceptional risk of feeling stress—females, live-in caregivers and those with depression often have higher stress levels than others.
Caregiver stress can not only lead to illness, but it can also preoccupy your mind and lower your patience with whomever you’re caring for. It’s important to make sure you’re regulating your stress levels and identifying when you need to take a step back to look after yourself before others.

401,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-to-balance-work-with-caring-for-an-elderly-parent/,"COVID-19 has turned our lives upside down. It has changed how and where we work and go to school. It has impacted household dynamics with a growing number of families managing multi-generational homes. And, it has made our elderly parents more dependent on us as stricter stay-at-home orders are placed on the most vulnerable.
The pandemic is playing with our emotions. As demands increase, we are all feeling overwhelmed, stressed and worried that another shutdown will happen and further disrupt our lives. For many, the unknown has interrupted the balance between work, family, school and the care of our elderly parents.
To help manage the stress that often comes with caregiving in general, we have gathered some tips and advice to help family caregivers balance work with caring for an elderly parent.
Stick to a routine. Try to separate work from your caregiving duties. Make caregiving-related calls and schedule doctor appointments during your personal time rather than during work hours. Wait until you get home from work to do more of the time-consuming tasks that involve your loved one.
Establish boundaries. Whether you are working in an office or working from home, make sure your parent knows you are in fact working, and that they should respect the schedule you have in place. Set aside certain times for short breaks during the day when you can check in with them.
Understand your benefits. Your company may have policies on caregiving, flexible work options, and family leave. You may also have access to an employee assistance program, which can be a valuable resource.
Talk with your supervisor in advance. Let them know about your caregiving situation. Make sure they understand that unforeseen things may come up that could impact how and when you work. Emphasize that you have an important responsibility to your elderly parent but that you are committed to your job as well.
Have a back-up plan at work and at home. Arrange for a co-worker to step in if you need to leave work unexpectedly to care for your elderly parent or loved one. Think ahead at home as well. As a family caregiver, you should have a plan for alternative care and prepare others for what they need to know should you be exposed or become ill with COVID-19.
Take care of yourself. Your well-being is important. Eat healthy, balanced meals, maintain a regular sleep routine, exercise, allow yourself time each week to take care of personal errands, or simply take time to relax.
Put safety measures in place. Have everyone in your household follow CDC-recommended protocols for personal hygiene and other guidelines, especially if the person in your care lives with you. If your elderly parent falls ill with the flu or with COVID-19, that could be dangerous. If you get sick, you can’t go to work or be an effective caregiver.
Caring for an elderly parent is not easy, and it can put a strain on your personal life and your career. Preparation and planning, knowing what resources are available to you and finding balance are all essential.

402,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-to-brighten-the-holidays-for-seniors/,"The holiday season is in full swing. We know that many celebrations – and possibly some long-standing traditions – may look different this year. But that doesn’t mean all festivities have to stop.
If you are a family caregiver, here are some things you can do to help brighten the holidays for seniors this year.
Help them get into the holiday spirit
While the holidays can be a time of joy and celebration, they can also be somewhat difficult for the elderly as they often experience loneliness and isolation.
- Deck the halls with some of their beloved holiday decorations such as wreaths, garlands and ornaments.
- Set aside time to bake holiday cookies, candy or other seasonal favorites together. You can even do this virtually if you are not able to visit in person.
- Watch their favorite holiday movie.
- Arrange for virtual caroling. Gather family and friends around the phone or computer to sing traditional holiday songs together.
- Drive through your neighborhood to take in some of the holiday light displays and decorations.
- Eat a traditional holiday meal together. If this is not an option, consider delivering a home-cooked meal to your loved one and set up a video chat so that you can share it together.
Help bring back their holiday traditions
Having familiarity during the holidays offers peace, comfort and joy, especially at a time when many seniors feel isolated. Allow your family member to talk about their most loved holiday traditions and consider bringing some of them back this year.
Help them connect with family and friends
During this pandemic, we have seen several creative ways people have tried to stay connected. It is especially important during this time of year to help your elderly parent feel as though they are part of holiday celebrations and family fun, even if you cannot spend time with each other in-person.
With so many ways to communicate – from Zoom to FaceTime to Skype – it’s easier than ever to stay in touch with the ones you love. Set up group video calls, virtual holiday celebrations or individual visits. Many seniors also enjoy receiving mail. Round up friends, family and the kids and have them send holiday cards, letters and messages them.
Social isolation and loneliness have played an even bigger part during this past year, especially among the elderly population. Unfortunately, the holidays can make these feelings more difficult to manage.
Help keep them active
Even in isolation, older adults need to stay active. There are many ways to encourage activity at home during the holidays, including:
- Walking or other light exercise
- Listening to music
- Cooking or baking holiday favorites
- Working on puzzles or other hobbies
- Looking through family photo albums
- Holiday card making, gift wrapping or decorating. Try some of these handmade DIY Christmas card ideas.
Love, appreciation, family and gratitude will be the resounding themes this season. We hope some of these ideas will help you brighten the holidays for the senior in your life.
If you are a family caregiver and you need help tackling all the things that come with the holiday season, request more information from your local FirstLight office. Our extraordinary caregivers can provide respite care services and elder care solutions at home, or in any setting, now and throughout the New Year.

403,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-to-cope-with-a-loved-ones-memory-loss/,"Studies estimate that up to 40 percent of adults over age 50 suffer from age-related memory loss. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia affect thousands of elderly Americans as well as their caregivers and loved ones. Renowned psychologist Dr. Dale Atkins, PhD. was recently interviewed on the TODAY show where she offered ways caregivers and friends and family members of victims of memory loss can remain connected. Here are a few of her suggestions:
• Continue to take part in events and activities that you both previously enjoyed together and still love to do. This helps remind your friend that these times are valuable to you.
• Incorporate music into daily activities. Many people with memory issues retain their appreciation of music for a long time and listening to their favorite tune is something that can bring great joy. Attend musical performances and concerts together or tell stories about favorite musicians.
• Engage through diet and exercise. Doing something active gets more oxygen to the brain and regular exercise reduces the risk for disorders that can lead to memory loss such as diabetes.
• Participate in mental exercises. Similar to how physical exercise keeps your body strong and healthy, mental exercise can help your brain function better. Strategy games such as chess, bridge and Scrabble are great ways to help keep an older mind sharp.
• Encourage organization and routine. Help your senior utilize calendars, clocks, lists and notes to focus on the task at hand. Suggest they keep easy-to-lose items in the same place each time after using them or park their car in the same place if they still drive.
It’s not easy dealing with a loved one who suffers from memory loss but it’s important to remain in touch and connected. Focus on the good times that can still be had, rather than the ones from the past."
404,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-to-deal-with-the-stress-of-aging-parents/,"Each day, millions of Americans deal with the task of caring for their aging parents. If you are a child of an aging parent that requires care, you already know how stressful this situation can be. The stress of financial burdens, time constraints, and lack of help can all build up to the point where you can no longer perform your responsibilities to the best of your abilities. Worse yet, your personal and family life will suffer as well. Whether
your parents are of good health or no longer able to live on their own, you must find healthy ways to deal with these stresses. In order to avoid becoming overwhelmed, we have compiled a short list of tips that will make your life as a caregiver much more rewarding.
Get Help
In order to avoid feeling overwhelmed with the duties as care giver for your parents, one of the best things you can do is know that you are not alone. Whether it be in the form of
other family members or caregiving services, make sure you find a way to get assistance you need before you become overwhelmed. If you decide to get help from other family members, be sure to discuss which duties each person will do. Make a plan that includes who will visit on certain days, who will take your parents to medical visits, and who will cover the financial situation, among other duties. When splitting up these duties, play to each person’s strengths. This will make it much easier for each individual involved and will make the situation less stressful. If you reach out to family and they cannot or will not help, don’t get angry with them.
Certain people may not be able to handle the stress that comes with caring for their parents, and you don’t want this to cause trouble within your family. If you reach out to a caregiving service, be sure to do your research and understand exactly what thy can do for you. If you go into a meeting with a caregiving service with the knowledge of what you need from them, it will be a much more rewarding experience.
Find a support group
According to a report by AARP, over 42 million Americans are currently taking care of their aging parents. This means that millions of people across the US, even families in your
own community, are dealing with the same stress as you. One of the best ways to deal with the stress involved in taking care of your parents is to discuss it with people in you
same situation. Not only will you be able to comfort one another, you might even learn some great tips on caring for your parents from people who have been through the same situation as yourself. Support groups can come from all walks of life, not just those that meet at specific times at community centers. Support groups can be family members, friends, or even coworkers. You would be amazed at how much you have in common with people in your lives going through the same issues as yourself. Sometimes all you need to deal with the stress of care giving is to simply talk about what you are going through and get it out of your head.
Develop a plan
One of the biggest stressors involved in caring for your aging parents is the fear of the unknown. Will we be able to afford caregiving services, when should my parent(s) move out of their home, and what do we if another family emergency arises that leaves me unable to care for my parents? These are many of the questions that will run through your head as you worry about what lies ahead. Even if you are doing well caring for your aging parents today, this fear of the unknown can keep preoccupied and cause a great deal of stress. One way to calm these fears is to develop a plan.
Decide what you and your parents will do in certain situations both in the short and long term. Plan out the finances future, what do do during an emergency, and when they should leave their home to make sure you are ready for anything that might happen. Once you develop a plan, you be able to calm these fears of the unknown and focus on whats most import, the present care of your parents. Another important note is to include your parents in this discussion if they are still able. It may be a difficult conversation, but it is a very important one none the less. Your parents will be hesitant to discuss these topics, especially about when they should move out of their home, but you must develop a plan to ensure a smooth transition no matter what may happen.
Take time for yourself
With all of the stress that accumulates while caring for your aging parents, you soon will find yourself overwhelmed. When you are overstressed and overwhelmed, you will not be able to perform to the best of your abilities, and your personal life will suffer as well.
Sometimes the best thing you can do for your parents is to take time for your self. Get exercise, read a book, do anything that takes your mind off of your duties as a care giver and back onto yourself. Once you take time for yourself, you will find your personal life improve, and the stress of care giving will melt away. Another note to consider is that of taking on more than you can handle. If you take on more than you can handle, no amount of free time will be able to relieve the stress of caregiving. For example, if there comes a time when your parents need to leave their home and you plan on taking them into your, make sure you are prepared for the burden that this creates. If you cannot balance the care of your parents with your personal life, you will end up doing more harm than good.
One Final Note:
Be familiar with your parents medical situation including who their doctor is, what medications they take, and what medical issues they are have. The more you know about their medical situation the less stressful the situation will be when an emergency arises."
405,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-to-enjoy-the-holidays/,"For many, the holidays are stressful times. Parties, holiday shopping, family gatherings, too much food, over spending…too many obligations and no time for relaxation. This isn’t how you want it to be, but yet every year it is. This year make a declaration to yourself to make it different. Today is the day to get that plan in place and make it a season of peace, joy, and celebration.
- Define what is most important to you. If it means more time with family, great. If it means something spiritual, super. If it means something else, fantastic. It’s whatever you want it to be.
- Stop worrying. You can’t control the future. If you have an office party or family gathering and these life events make you stressed – take a deep breath and focus on the immediate moment. Worrying gets you nowhere. When the time comes for the party or gathering – be positive. Look for ways to enjoy the time you have with others.
- Keep things simple. If you exchange gifts and you don’t have a clue what to get someone – keep it simple. Get a gift certificate to their favorite restaurant, coffee shop, bookstore, or a movie theater.
- Start your own tradition. Is there something you have always wanted to do during the holidays but there was no time to fit it in? This year, break free and do it. Invite friends or family members to join you and then plan to do it again next year.
- Do things that give meaning. If the holidays have become too commercialized for your liking, then volunteer, engage in spiritual activities, or do something that will allow you to make this season special for you.
- Take time for you. Make time for some activities that nourish you such as keeping up with your exercise routine, trying to get a little extra sleep, or just finding some down time for you.
From all of us at FirstLight Home Care, we hope you have a wonderful holiday season. Enjoy the celebrations and make the most of your time with family and friends. We certainly plan to!"
406,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-to-find-in-home-care-you-can-trust/,"Is a loved one having trouble with dressing, bathing or mobility on their own, or are they missing doctor’s appointments? These are red flags that it’s time to consider in-home care.
If in-home care is something you want to explore, you need to find a company you can trust. This certainly takes time and effort. However, it will be well worth it when you have access to experienced and compassionate caregivers who will treat your loved one like family. The caregiver(s) you choose will also meet your loved one’s practical needs, whether it’s with meal preparation, mobility, housekeeping or in a range of other ways.
The question is: where do you begin? Here’s how to start the process of finding an in-home caregiver:
Step 1: Identify Your Loved One’s In-Home Care Needs
Before you reach out to an in-home care company or individual caregiver, make sure you know what your loved one needs. Are they relatively independent and simply require some help with light housekeeping, meals and companionship? Or do they need more extensive care and support?
In addition, if they have health conditions, like dementia or diabetes, you’ll want a caregiver who has specific experience with these diseases. Some common activities caregivers assist with include:
- Bathing and showering
- Personal hygiene and grooming
- Dressing
- Toileting and incontinence
- Mobility
- Eating
Step 2: Ask for Referrals for In-Home Care
Getting recommendations – from friends, family or your loved one’s doctor – is a great way to find in-home care you can trust. If someone you know has worked with a company or a caregiver who performed exceptionally well, you’ll know to put them on your list to consider. Likewise, if they had a negative experience, you can keep that in mind during your search.
You can also use the federal government’s free locator website, Eldercare Locator. Once you have a few options in mind, research them online so you can learn more about their services, experience and reputation.
Step 3: Consider an In-Home Care Company Rather Than an Individual
When looking for in-home care, you can work with a company who employs professional caregivers. You can also find a caregiver on your own through a staffing agency or online.
However, keep in mind, when you work with a company, they’ll perform rigorous screening and background checks. They’ll also make sure caregivers are carefully trained and have the right experience to meet your loved one’s needs. In addition, if your loved one’s condition changes over time, a company will serve as a trusted partner who can help modify and adjust care as needed. You won’t have to worry about finding additional or different caregivers with more specialized expertise.
Step 4: Ask About Caregiver Screening and Experience
Once you are ready to talk with in-home care companies, ask about their screening and hiring process. You’ll want to ensure they are performing a thorough background check, including checking driving records, criminal histories and references.
Most companies will have a team member schedule an in-home visit at your loved one’s home. During that time, you’ll be able to ask these and other questions, so you can determine if the caregiver can provide the kind of help you are seeking.
Some additional questions to ask during this process include:
- What level of training and experience do your caregivers have?
- How will you ensure a good match between my loved one and their caregiver?
- When are they available and what are my scheduling options?
- What is the price for your services?
If possible, make sure your loved one is part of this process. They’ll have their own questions to ask and will feel more comfortable in the long run when they’re involved in the selection of their caregiver.
Step 5: Have a Trial Period with Your In-Home Caregiver
Once you have one or more caregivers in place to provide in-home care, consider a trial period. This will help you evaluate whether they’re a good fit for your loved one. It will also allow time to ensure the services being provided are at the right level and frequency.
Make sure you’re checking in with your loved one regularly to ask how the situation is going and to see if they have any concerns. Once the trial period is over, you can adjust care as needed.

407,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-to-find-the-right-caregiver/,"A caregiver is an important companion for your parent and can support them with everything from bathing and light housekeeping, to meal preparation, prescription pick-ups and transportation to and from doctor’s appointments.
If you have determined that having additional outside support to help you care for your parents, you might struggle with where to start to find an outside service and even one you can trust. Following are some important considerations to get the process started.
- Caregivers can be found through personal referrals, but oftentimes it is easier to go through a reliable referring service that handles the background checks to ensure that the caregiver you hire has been carefully vetted.
- Ask your parents Doctor. Most medical professionals have had long term relationships with caregivers and can provide recommendations on companies or individuals that would best serve your parent’s needs.
- If you hire a caregiver directly, you will want to be certain you understand the liability associated with employing a caregiver, particularly if this person will be driving your loved one to appointments.
- You will want to hire a company that has caregivers who are bonded, insured and professionally trained. If your parents require a higher degree of medical care and monitoring of certain health conditions, you will want to hire a caregiving company that can provide staffing that has more in-depth medical training.
- If you are hiring a company, ask for recommendations. Check them out online. Call actual clients that have used their services to see what their experience was like.
- Ask questions and meet regularly. Listen to your parent and then talk with the caregiver you bring on board. Make sure you are asking them questions about their daily care and meet with them face-to-face. Be there the first few times the new caregiver is with your parents to help ease and build the relationship between all parties.
There are many things you can do to find the right caregiver for your parents and their specific needs. For more information or if you have any questions about the care your parents need or currently have, contact a local FirstLight Home Care office."
408,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-to-help-your-parent-safely-manage-their-medications/,"Your parents may be taking multiple medications throughout the day and it can be easy for a mix-up to happen.
Studies conducted by the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists have reported that 87% of seniors take at least one prescription drug, while 36% take 5 or more; and 38% use over-the-counter medications.
Taking medicine correctly is essential to your older adult’s health and wellness! That’s why helping your parents with medication management is so important. Understanding what your parent is taking will help to avoid common medication mistakes like taking the wrong drug, missing doses, or taking more than prescribed.
Here are 7 important tips to help your elderly parents safely manage their medications.
1.Make a complete list. Gather up everything your parent is taking and create a list. This includes all prescription drugs, over-the-counter products, vitamins, herbal supplements and occasional remedies, such as sleep or cold medicines.
Be sure to write down:
- Names of each prescription medication, over-the-counter medication, vitamins, and supplements
- How often each is taken and the dosage
- The healthcare provider who prescribed each prescription medication
- The purpose of each medication and/or symptoms it’s meant to treat
- Whether each is for short-term or long-term use
This list will help you and your aging parents understand what they’re taking and when so that you can avoid any mistakes.
2. Connect with your parent’s pharmacist and/or doctor. Once you’ve compiled a complete list of medications, supplements, vitamins and over-the-counter drugs that your parent is taking, share it with their pharmacist and/or primary doctor. They can review and identify redundancies, potential interactions, and side effects and provide recommendations.
3. Keep all medications in one place and stored properly. Locate all the medications, vitamins and supplements your parent is taking and put them in one location. In general, the medication should be kept in a cool, dry place. That means the bathroom cabinet isn’t ideal because moisture and heat can affect the drug. Also, keep medications in a place that kids and pets cannot get to.
4. Find the right pillbox. You can choose from a variety of dispensers and pillbox timers, with pharmacies stocking everything from basic day-of-the-week cups to four-times-a-day expanded versions. Color-coded dispensers often work well. Electronic versions come with alarms to remind patients and let others know when doses are missed. Talking pillboxes can be helpful for patients with vision loss.
5. Pre-sort medications for the week. Staying organized is essential to good medication management for seniors. Using a pill organizer allows you to help your parents pre-sort their medications for the week.
The best type of pill organizer is one with enough compartments for every dose they’ll need throughout the day. If any pills need to be split, do it ahead of time and include those halves in the pill organizer compartments. That way, your parents won’t need to fumble with a pill cutter or remember to split pills before taking them.
6. Make sure your parent understands his or her medications. It is essential that your elderly parent follows the doctor’s instructions when it comes to their medications to avoid the risk of negative drug interactions and potential side effects. Make sure you and your older adult understand which medications are safe to take at the same time and which need to be spaced out to prevent adverse side effects.
If there’s any uncertainty, ask your parent’s doctor for detailed descriptions and instructions to ensure medications are taken correctly.
7. Develop a plan for refilling. It’s important to plan for medication refills. With long-term prescription medications, it’s essential to get refills on time so your older adult won’t run out and miss doses.
- Talk with your parent’s doctor about prescribing a 90-day supply and if they recommend a mail-order pharmacy.
- New online pharmacy services like PillPack or Express Scripts offer online delivery and medication coordination services.
- Talk with your parent’s pharmacist to find out if they offer automatic refills with a notification when the prescription is ready to be picked up.
- Check to see if the pharmacy provides a prescription delivery service that can have medications delivered to the home.
If someone you care for is taking several different medications each day, it can be overwhelming. But understanding the medications, following the doctor’s instructions, staying on schedule, and asking the right questions can help prevent medicine mismanagement.
FirstLight caregivers can provide support with medication reminders. Through our in-home caregivers cannot administer medications, they can provide regular reminders for oral medications or injections. They also can assist with pre-measured medication and the monitoring of side effects or other medical issues.
Find a local FirstLight Home Care location near you and ask them about our special medical dispensers and other helpful home healthcare technology solutions.

409,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-to-hire-a-caregiver-that-actually-cares/,"As awareness of elder abuse increases, the difficulties of finding and hiring a trustworthy caregiver are brought to light. Many adult children have learned the hard way, as told in a recent LA Times article. The search for the right caregiver is made even more challenging in states like California where caregiver background checks and screenings are not required. Here are a few of the most important things to consider when hiring a caregiver for an elderly loved one:
• Decide exactly what you need and write it down. Create a job description that encompasses everything that is important to you and detail exactly what is expected from the prospective caregiver.
• A personal caregiver will be in your or your loved one’s house frequently—lay down the house rules and make sure they acknowledge them.
• Hiring through an agency such as FirstLight has many perks like performing background checks on employees or providing fill-in help if your caregiver calls in sick or in the event of an emergency. Fully research an agency before signing up for their services—every agency differs in cost, available programs, etc.
In an effort to provide seniors and their families expanded access to verified and trusted in-home caregivers, FirstLight formed a partnership with SeniorChecked, a national network that helps seniors safely and independently age in place by connecting them to verified and trusted local service providers.

In extreme heat, especially with high humidity, safety for our seniors is very important. At FirstLight Home Care, our mission is to keep seniors safe, healthy and happy in any conditions.
Extreme heat can lead to heat stroke, heat rash or heat exhaustion. Symptoms of heat-related illnesses include feeling tired or confused, headaches, dry skin (no perspiration), a rapid pulse or feeling nauseous or dizzy. If you or a loved one have any of these symptoms, seek medical attention as soon as possible.
Stay in air conditioned areas. If you know a senior without air conditioning, check in on him or her frequently and invite him or her somewhere with air conditioning. When temperatures climb above 90 degrees, fans won’t help our bodies to cool down, so stick to climate-controlled areas.
Drink lots of water. When temperatures rise, we sweat more to help cool down. To replace that moisture, be sure to drink clear, alcohol-free liquids frequently.
Find fun indoor activities. Take a trip to the mall, go to a movie, visit an indoor pool or the local library. You don’t need to stay cooped up at home when it’s hot outside, but stay in air conditioned buildings to stay safe and comfortable.
Dress for the heat. If you must go outside, keep outside exposure brief and wear light colored, loose-fitting clothing that will reflect the sunlight and some of the heat. A hat and sunglasses will protect your eyes and sunscreen will help prevent sunburn."

Caregiving is one of the most loving and one of the most stressful roles you can take on. You may be motivated by many influences, from a sense of caring to a sense of responsibility. But no matter what has brought you to this role, it’s important to understand that your loved one’s crisis can turn into a health crisis for you if you don’t build a network of help and support. You can’t be there every minute, even if help is needed around the clock. Because most people want to stay in their own home indefinitely, one of the best ways to manage the needs of a love one is with in-home care.
When to Consider In-Home Care
Not being able to manage the activities of daily living signals that your loved one’s needs have increased and more outside care is needed. Difficulty might involve the more complex tasks, like shopping, cooking and managing money, and even more basic ones such as daily hygiene, going the bathroom and being able to get dressed.
Here are the telltale signs you should look for:
- Confusion or forgetfulness
- Hoarding
- Lapses in self-care and housekeeping
- Mismanaged finances (look for past due notices and unopened bills)
- Poor sense of day and time
How many activities of daily living your loved one is having trouble with will determine the level of care needed.
How to Broach Hiring a Caregiver
Bringing up the idea of outside help is one of the hardest conversations you’ll have with a loved one—many people, seniors in particular, may view it as a first step toward (unwanted) assisted living. But pointing out that getting help at home can actually prevent a move to a nursing home may allow the idea to be viewed in a positive light.
Suggest starting slowly, with a caregiver coming in just once or twice a week for a few hours at first and point out these advantages to having help at home:
- Preparing meals and making sure they get needed nutrients
- Shopping for groceries and health needs
- Providing reminders about taking medication, getting exercise and eating well
- Providing transportation to doctor visits and other medical appointments
Home care agencies offer a spectrum of services personalized for the needs of each client. Some assistance requires a home health aide while other tasks can be handled by a caregiver who’s more of a companion. Having an evaluation will help you find the right person to add to your loved one’s care team.
Final Considerations
When choosing in-home care for a loved one, remember that you’re looking to balance the risk level of the person in need with the amount of family involvement you and others can provide. Learn about all the options available to you and have an open, honest conservation with the home agencies you’re considering to determine what’s best for your situation. Finally, although this might be a step that you want to put off, don’t wait for a crisis to begin looking for in-home care—doing it now gives you time that you won’t have in an emergency.

Hoarding behavior goes beyond just collecting mementos of the past. Oftentimes your loved one’s home will be filled with clutter or even trash, and they may find it difficult or impossible to get rid of these things. Their home may become filled, with only narrow pathways to navigate from room to room. These hoarded items can eventually become a health or safety concern and potentially a fire hazard.
When hoarding reaches these unhealthy levels, it’s up to the family members to intervene. But this can be complicated, and it can backfire if handled incorrectly.

413,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-to-pay-for-home-care/,"When your elderly parents or loved one needs senior care, they will often tell you that they would prefer to receive care in the comfort of their own home. At first, the in-home care services they need could be non-medical, such as light housekeeping, food preparation, companion, or personal care. As they age, however, the home services they require could increase to include medical services that involve the expertise of health care professionals like nurses and therapists.
Every In-Home Care Scenario is Different
Non-medical home care, like any other elder care service, costs money. And every in-home care situation is unique. To give you examples, here are three common scenarios you could be facing with your loved one:
Example 1: Dad needs 4 hours of care per day
Dad is still mostly independent, perhaps living alone. But due to some mobility issues because of age or even recovering from surgery, he may need a little extra help with daily tasks. This could include help with bathing and dressing for the day, light housekeeping and meal preparation, and grocery shopping or other errand running.
Example 2: Mom needs 12-16 hours of care per day
Mom may live with a family member or adult child who is her primary caregiver, but Mom can’t be left alone due to a condition such as Alzheimer’s Disease or a disability. Her main caregiver may work outside the home during the day and has evening activities and responsibilities that they must attend to, needing someone they trust to be with Mom when they cannot be.
Example 3: Harold needs 24/7 care or live-in services
Harold should not be left alone but lives alone or with someone else who is unable to care for him, perhaps his wife. In this case, the best options might be:
- 24/7 care, where caregivers attend to Harold’s needs in 8-hour shifts
- A live-in situation, where assigned caregivers have two- or three-day shifts, but the situation also allows for them to get a full night’s sleep in their own space during that time.
This scenario is common for individuals with dementia or Alzheimer’s Disease, a severe disability with little to no mobility, or other major health issues such as paralysis due to a stroke. Caregivers are there to help with all personal and companion care needs, such as meal prep and eating assistance, personal hygiene, daily household tasks and errands, and transportation to and from doctors’ appointments.
How Do You Pay for In-Home Care?
We have highlighted some of the most common ways to pay for personal and companion in-home care services.
Private Pay
Private pay is just that, personal funds that an individual or their family uses for in-home care from their own assets, investments or savings. Private pay resources can be used to cover expenses tied to a loved one’s caregiving costs.
Long-Term Care Insurance
Long Term Care Insurance (LTCI) is different from traditional health insurance because it is designed to pay for the cost of custodial and personal care (versus strictly medical care) and cover long-term care needs, support, and services as you age. LTCI is a type of insurance purchased from private insurance companies specifically to cover the costs of nursing homes, assisted living and in-home health care.
Benefits vary depending on the plan, so you must understand the services covered by the policy at the time of purchase. Assistance with the cost of personal in-home care may only be provided if the plan has an allowance for non-medical services. When purchasing a long-term care policy, be sure to plan ahead.
Reverse Mortgage
A reverse mortgage is a special type of home equity loan specifically designed for people aged 62 and older. Elderly individuals may choose to leverage their home equity to help cover the costs for in-home care, assisted living, nursing home care, and home modifications to allow aging in place. Unlike traditional home equity loans, reverse mortgages do not require borrowers to make regular payments. Instead, the loan comes due when the borrower sells the home, moves from the home, or passes away.
When considering a reverse mortgage there is a lot to understand. “What to Know About Reverse Mortgages” from AARP.org is a great article with helpful information to get you started.
Medicaid
Medicaid is a joint state and federal program that provides health coverage to individuals with low income. Traditionally, Medicaid has paid for long-term care in a nursing home for people with functional and financial needs. But in-home care provides an alternative for seniors who require assistance to remain living at home. In-home care through Medicaid can help seniors maintain their independence and age at home, and it is also more cost-effective for the state.
In-home care services may be available through one’s regular state Medicaid plan but may also be offered through Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) Medicaid waivers. Eligibility requirements and covered services vary by state, so check your state regulations for specific details.
Medicare Advantage
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has broadened the scope of supplemental benefits Medicare Advantage (MA) plans can offer, and some MA plans offered by private insurance companies have in-home care services as part of a supplemental benefits package. These services might include adult day care services, home-based palliative care, in-home support services, support for caregivers of enrollees, and others. Please know that plans vary greatly. You can find additional information and Medicare Advantage Plans at Medicare.gov.
Veterans Aid and Attendance
The Veterans Aid & Attendance Pension is a benefit that helps reduce the cost of care for older veterans and their surviving spouses. Veterans and their spouses who require the regular aid and attendance of another person (for activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, medication monitoring, and other in-home care) may qualify for this special benefit in addition to a monthly pension.
To learn more about Aid and Attendance benefits, military service qualifications and how your veteran can benefit from these services, visit the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs website.

414,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-to-provide-care-for-the-caregiver/,"As a caregiver, you balance a busy schedule. Between work, family and caring for a senior or loved one, sometimes you find it difficult to make time for yourself. But finding time to do so can make all the difference in your work—just ask the experts at Caring.com, a great web resource that offers tips on how you can help parents and seniors in all aspects of their lives. This week I came across an interesting article discussing the topic of “me” time. Where does “me” time fit into caregiving? In quite a few places, actually. Those who make time for themselves within their busy routines will have more energy and are better able to endure the stress and emotional pressure that caregiving can present. Most importantly, “me” time allows them to be more reliable to those who depend on their care.
How can you find ways to feel like yourself again and deliver the highest level of care to your senior or loved one? Consider these helpful tips when making time for yourself.
Get It In Writing: By scheduling personal time into your daily routine, you have less of chance to put on the backburner. Carving out a small slot of time earlier in the day will give you the boost you need to carry you through your afternoon. And don’t include routine chores, such as housekeeping or paying bills, as personal time. Take the time to relax and do something you enjoy.
Just Say “No”: The best way to manage your time is to provide a cushion that allows you some breathing room. Sometimes that means saying no to requests that aren’t pressing. Even if you are a “yes” person by nature, the more you bow out of a request in the interest of time management, the easier it becomes the next time. By doing so, you are allowing yourself to put your best efforts forward for providing personal care.
Create a Personal Space: Creating your own personal space—be it a room, desk or backyard area—will allow you the freedom to retreat when you are overwhelmed, emotionally or physically. Make sure the space makes you feel calm and collected. It can also be a meditative space where you can write down some of the issues that may be challenging you, which is a fantastic way to work through any impeding stress.
Buy Time: Never underestimate the power of outsourcing. Spending a little bit of money can buy you time, whether it means hiring a biweekly cleaning service or a grocery delivery service. By doing so, you will create personal time for yourself. The additional free time will be worth the additional expense.
Above all, a rested mind and soul will allow you to provide the highest level of care for your loved one, which is what FirstLight Home Care is all about."
415,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-to-reduce-your-stress-over-the-holiday-season/,"We all look forward to Christmas, right? It is a day of relaxing, possibly watching the annual Christmas parade and/or football, eating too much yummy food, being thankful for all that we have and being surrounded by family and friends.
Well, that’s how it’s supposed to be in a perfect world. But, we all know that holidays aren’t
perfect and neither are our families. Unfortunately, there can be a lot stress that comes with the holidays too. For one, traveling (whether it’s by car or plane) can be taxing on one’s patience, especially if there are kids involved. And, as much as we all love
our families, they can get on your nerves…parents included.
So, here’s some advice on how to reduce your stress about your parents or in-laws as well as other family members coming over to your house for Christmas.
#1. Don’t Do It All Yourself!
Christmas should be an enjoyable occasion for all including the host/hostess. If you have set the precedent that you will do it all then you are setting yourself up for stress. My suggestion is to approach Christmas as a collaborative effort. Everyone is assigned to bring something. There are going to be some family or friends who aren’t great in the kitchen, but that’s okay. Assign them to something easy such as the vanilla ice cream and Cool Whip for the pies. If this approach is new for your family, it may come as a bit of surprise when you bring it up. But over time, your loved ones will (hopefully)
understand how and why having everyone pitch in makes for a day to truly be
thankful about.
#2. Take a Deep Breath
So, Christmas morning has arrived, as will your guests in just a few short hours. There’s so much to do! The last thing you need is for your mom to analyze how you prepared the bird or set the table, or for your mother-in-law to ask why you didn’t fix sweet potatoes.
They always have sweet potatoes at Christmas. So, when these types of comments come rolling your way, my best advice is to take a deep breath and count to 10 (or 20
whichever it takes to get you past the “feedback” with grace).
#3. Love Your Family For Who They Are…Flaws and All
Going along with #2, we also need to remember that with the holidays comes heightened sensitivity to criticism, especially when it comes from those closest to us. We have known our loved ones for a long time, and we also know how to push each other’s buttons. At Christmas, we need to remember that we should love each other, for which we are, not who we want others to be. None of us are perfect, and we won’t and don’t react exactly the way others think we should. You will find your stress level greatly reduced
if you go into the holidays remembering this.
Happy (stress-free) Christmas to you and your family from the FirstLight Home Care Family!!"
416,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-to-talk-to-kids-and-teens-about-coronavirus/,"Everywhere you turn people are talking about the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). This unprecedented pandemic is affecting nearly everyone and everything – from school closures and job loss to the cancellation of special events to limited interaction with friends and family.
If the news of these uncertain and unusual times is impacting how you are feeling, it most likely is impacting the children in your household too.
Kids and teenagers alike need adults to help them put something like COVID-19 into perspective. It is important to create an open and supportive environment where children can ask questions… and if they are not asking, then start a conversation. If you’re not sure how to start the conversation, below are some tips on how to talk to kids and teens about COVID-19.
- Assess what your child already knows. Start by asking them what they may know about Coronavirus and clarify any inaccurate information that they may have heard.
- Stay calm throughout the conversation. Even though you may be concerned yourself, it is important to remain calm when talking about the virus. Children will look to you to see how afraid they should be.
- Talk at an age-appropriate level. Keep things simple and useful. Use words and concepts that children can understand. Gear your explanation to the child’s age, language, and developmental level. We found these Facts Sheets from the CDC that might be helpful when talking with your children.
- Do not dismiss your child’s fears. Listen to your child while they are talking and don’t gloss over any fears they may have. Validate their concern. In a calm voice, address their feelings and help them come up with solutions to reduce their anxiety and distress.
- Reassure them that they are safe. Let your kids know what is being done to help keep everyone safe and healthy. And emphasize simple things they can do to protect themselves, their family and friends.
- Limit the amount of news the family is watching. Control how much time children are watching COVID-19 news coverage on the television or on their devices. Too much news can be disturbing and confusing.
- Reinforce good hygiene. One way to stop the spread of the Coronavirus is to practice good hand hygiene. Make sure your kids are washing their hands for at least 20 seconds before and after meals, after they go to the bathroom, after they come in from outside and after they’ve blown their nose or put their hands in their mouth.
- Continue to have open conversations. The coronavirus pandemic is a health concern for the young and old. New information and details on the spread of the virus are updated frequently. It is important to continue to talk with your child about how they are feeling and what new questions they may have about the disease.
Children of all ages can feel frightened and confused. As parents and caring adults, we can best help by listening and responding in an honest, consistent, and supportive manner.

417,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-to-talk-to-your-parents-about-home-care/,"As our parents get older, they may need more help than they are willing to ask for. Talking with your parents or an aging loved one about needing home care can be a difficult conversation for both of you. For them, it might represent a loss of independence. For you, it can be difficult because you must come with terms with the likelihood that you will need help caring for them.
Here are seven helpful tips to help you to start the home care conversation.
- Do your homework. Before you start the conversation, research the various options that are available.
- Do not wait for a crisis to start the conversation. Start talking about home care solutions now so that you can ask them how they would like to address the issue when the time comes.
- Address your concerns. Be open and honest with your feelings and the challenges you have juggling your home life, career, and now their care. According to a recent study by Genworth, 55 percent of Americans say being a burden on their family is their biggest concern regarding long-term care issues. Take this into consideration when approaching your parent about accepting in-home help.
- Show Empathy. Change is scary. When talking with your parents, try to understand how they could be feeling. It is important to realize that this change may feel like they are losing control of their independence. By showing empathy and listening to them, it will allow for a conversation to occur where you can discuss alternatives that help them retain what control they have left.
- Focus on the advantages and benefits. Any conversation you have about caregiving should focus on why home care is a good thing. Instead of concentrating on why your loved one needs assistance, point out the benefits of having a caregiver there to support their personal needs and care.
- Explore home care options together. Include your aging parents in the process of finding the best solutions for them. Allow them to be a part of the decision-making process. Let them look at the options and even meet with the home care company prior to making any final decisions.
- Test the waters. Try hiring an outside caregiver for in-home help on a short-term basis for your respite care. This provides an opportunity to show your parents that having a caregiver is not something to fear and often leads to them being open to receiving ongoing care.
When you are ready to talk with your elderly parents about the benefits of in-home support, FirstLight Home Care is here to support you. Our local caregivers are here to help ease everyone’s concerns by giving you the support you need to provide the best care for your loved one. We will work with you to create a caregiving partnership that is built on trust, communication, and a special understanding of your family’s needs.
During this time, please know that FirstLight Home Care is fully operational, and our caregivers are available to help. The safety and well-being of our caregivers, clients and community have always been our top priority. That is why we have taken extra care to provide our team with the most up-to-date safety information and training to keep everyone protected and healthy."
418,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-to-work-with-the-nursing-home-caring-for-your-elderly-parent/,"Taking the step to move your parents to a nursing home is very much like sending your
child to the first day of school. There are mixed emotions, as you are so excited for your loved one to be cared for by professionals, the worry of losing control also sets in. More importantly, the worry of your loved ones safety is always a concern and rightfully so.
Once you have decided on a place fit for your parents’ needs, it is important to stay
involved in their care but to also begin to trust those tending to your parents. Most nursing homes are open to family involvement and encourage family to come around often. Constant conversation and familiar faces aid in good health in your elders. Listed below are a few valuable topics that are of utmost importance when working with those caring for your parents.
- Communication. This is quite possibly the most important topic. It is imperative that communication happens in both directions between the nursing home and you. No one knows your parents and their needs as well as you do. On the other hand, nursing home professionals have been trained to provide proper geriatric care and treatment. With that said, working together and keeping lines of communication open will help implement proper intervention. Don’t be afraid to voice your concerns. Most nursing homes embrace feedback from families, and it will also give you a sense of teamwork.
- Praise. This may be one of the harder topics to deliver. As your parents age,
it can be a stressful time. It is sad to see them weak and difficult not knowing what to do to make them comfortable. Remember, during those difficult times, nursing home professionals are working around the clock to provide your parents with the care they need. The relationship between you and the nursing home will be a better one if you make it apparent that you appreciate all they do. A thank you and nice gestures go a long way and that positive atmosphere will better the lives of your parents.
- Play a Role. It is important to play an important role in your parents care…without overstepping your boundaries. During communication, find out what is best for your parents during this time of need and when it is time to let go and let the nursing home do their job. Take the time to create a plan of your involvement and seek the advice of the professionals around you.
Most likely, you have learned of the nursing home’s programs and philosophies prior
to choosing this certain place. However, it is important to meet with nursing home individuals to go over, once again, your parents’ care. This is also the perfect time to ask as many questions as you may have."
419,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/how-your-midnight-snacking-could-be-killing-you/,"We admit, there are many days where we are not going to bed at a reasonable time due to the distractions of our favorite late night television shows(darn you Jimmy Fallon), work, and just surfing the web on our tablet and smartphone. Too often, before we head off to slumber, we get something to eat.
We know this is directly correlated to our feelings of not getting enough sleep and the extra pounds showing up on our scale.
Unfortunately it’s been confirmed. A new study by researchers at the Salk Institute cautions against an extended period of snacking, suggesting instead that confining caloric consumption to an 8- to 12-hour period–as people did just a century ago–might stave off high cholesterol, diabetes and obesity.
The results, published on December 2, 2014 in the journal Cell Metabolism, add to mounting evidence suggesting that it’s not just what we eat but when we eat it that matters to our health. We should eat during the hours where we are also burning calories. For us, we would look at the hours of 6:00 am and 6:00 pm.
We are creatures of habit and we’re certain this pattern will be one that is difficult to break.
But we know we have to for our health. We know we still may stay up way past our bedtime in the coming years, but what we will change is when and what we eat. No more late night snacks and beverages. We’re going to stick to a meal plan that has us eating during parts of the day when we can optimize how we breakdown calories. We’ll let you know how this all turns out in a few months. Check back this spring to see our progress.

420,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/i-dont-believe-you-just-said-that-7-statements-to-question-in-your-cancer-fight/,"Today we bring you another guest post from Joni Aldrich, renowned author and speaker.
The expression “sticks and stones may break your bones, but words can never harm me” is not true. When you’re fighting for your life against cancer or any critical illness, words can make all of the difference in the world.
For Gordon and I, the first “I don’t believe you just said that!” moment came during the initial visit to his oncologist. We had found a treatment facility for his type of cancer in Little Rock, Arkansas. When we asked that first oncologist about a referral, he said, “I’ve never seen anything good come out of Little Rock!”
Unfortunately, we didn’t challenge that doctor’s decision. As a result, the second “I don’t believe you just said that!” statement surfaced five months later. The same oncologist called me at work and said that Gordon’s cancer treatment was now a “salvage operation.” That news sent us racing to Little Rock. By then, too much damage had been done by wasted treatments and time.
Here are a few of those “I don’t believe you just said that!” statements to watch out for. And be aware: they’re not always from a doctor.
The End of the Road Sucker-Punch. “Mr. Smith, I’m afraid there’s nothing we can do about your cancer. Put your affairs in order.” Sometimes these words are accurate…and sometimes, that’s not necessarily the case. Keep these points in mind:
1) Before you go for an appointment with your first oncologist (not necessarily your primary oncologist), realize that it is only your first opinion. Webster’s definition of an opinion is a “belief stronger than impression and less strong than positive knowledge.” Do not settle for betting your life on one opinion!
2) Cancer physicians now tend to stay away from predicting the date of your demise. They can give you the average survival rate based on facts that they should know. They can also set up a referral for your second opinion with an oncologist who is more experienced in your type of cancer.
3) Many people I talk to either have heard these words firsthand, or have had family members to receive this verdict. Some are still walking around. While there has to be a fine line between treating for the patient to survive and treating a patient when there is truly no possibility of recovery, there is always continuing research. It’s your personal choice whether to give up or keep fighting.
The Heroic Lone Ranger. “Honey, there’s no need to go to the oncologist with me today.” Tag teaming (taking back-up with you to every oncologist’s visit) is very important. Cancer is complicated; you never know what may come out of a visit to your oncologist. Decisions come in multiples and sometimes have to be made quickly. Two sets of eyes and ears are better than one, especially if the patient isn’t feeling well.
The Most-Likely-to-Succeed Proclamation. “This is the best cancer treatment center and oncologist in this area to treat your type and stage of cancer.” The key words in this statement are “in this area.” Do you want a facility that treats 50 patients with your type of cancer every year, or 350? The statistics may be surprising. While it’s nice to have a doctor you like, one who can save your life is more important.
The Blind Follower. “I’m afraid to ask questions. The medical professionals are the experts. They will keep me informed.” Maybe, but you still need to know the basics. The only stupid questions are the ones that you don’t ask. There will be an incredible amount of details. Cancer professionals have (hopefully) lots and lots of patients of which you are only one.
The Patronizing Pat on the Head. “Mrs. Smith, it isn’t important for you to get copies of all medical test results.” Insist on copies of all test results. You’re entitled to them, even if you use them to line the trashcan. You’ll start to understand the basics. When I say ‘the devil’s in the details,’ I mean it. You need the details.
The No-Big-Deal Brush-Off. “I don’t need to go in with my spouse for this. They’re just giving him a shot.” That’s not necessarily true for a cancer patient. A shot is not always just a shot. Sometimes there are bad reactions—even allergic reactions. Cancer patients take so many medications that there is always a possibility that something might go wrong. The patient and caregiver should understand all medications that are administered to the patient—even if it’s only a shot.
The Urgent Ultimatum. “Mrs. Smith, we need to perform a radical mastectomy right away. There is no time for a second opinion.” If you hear these words, weigh your options carefully. A friend who was diagnosed with breast cancer received a message on her answering machine that her oncologist had already scheduled her radical mastectomy. After an appointment with another oncologist, she had a lumpectomy instead, and today (years later) is still cancer free.
When it comes to any serious medical condition, the rule of thumb is to never let a statement, verdict, or recommendation slide without first considering it fully. If you have doubts, voice them. If you have questions, ask them. And if you want more explanation, don’t leave until you get it. In the end, your persistence might literally save your life.

421,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/identifying-family-caregivers/,"National Family Caregivers Month started out as a weeklong celebration during the Thanksgiving holiday and has grown to encompass the entire month of November while gaining a following nationwide. National Family Caregivers Month was created as a time to thank, support, educate and empower family caregivers, an ever-growing role as our nation’s elderly population ages. With over 65 million family caregivers in the United States, it’s a topic that many people are personally affected by.
According to the National Family Caregivers Association (NFCA) President and CEO Suzanne Mintz, the ongoing theme for this year’s message is Identifying Family Caregivers. This initiative addresses the fact that despite the enormous responsibilities and taxing duties of family caregivers, they are practically invisible in our healthcare system. Currently, there is no spot on patient medical intake forms to signify whether or not someone is or has a family caregiver, even though it is highly likely. Without this information, the role of the family caregiver is essentially disregarded. Suzanne suggests being proactive when filling out the forms—make a notation that you’re a primary care provider right on the sheet.
To learn more about how you can help raise awareness and support toward family caregiver issues, efforts and education, check out the NFCA website here."
422,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/im-the-pastrami/,"This week has been more challenging than most. My 35-year-old daughter, Angie, has been having back problems and had to go for an outpatient surgery procedure in an attempt to reduce the numbness, tingling and sharp pain she has been experiencing. Her and my son-in-law, Bob, needed to leave around 5:30 am for the surgery center so I took what was supposed to be a “mental health” day to get my 3 grandchildren off to school. Honestly, getting the 5 and 7 year olds up, fed, dressed and on the school bus was not difficult. The only near miss we had was when after getting his coat on, back pack in place and lunch in hand, Weston had to use the bathroom and it was just minutes before his bus was to arrive. Thinking back on it now is pretty funny as we hurried to reverse the process we just went through to get him ready, having him run to the bathroom while I am saying “hurry up” over and over again, and then “saddling up” again to make it onto the bus in time. Next was waiting on “Miss Carley” , the princess to wake up. We had decided she would have a day with me instead of going to preschool. All of this came together much better than expected except that I had not slept much the night before since I was on Carley’s bottom bunk.
Child care, even though there was a lot to do, was the best part of the week. The very next day, my cousin called and my beloved aunt, who was 89, had fallen suddenly ill. They had taken her to the doctor, returned home only to have to call the ambulance when she had so much pain that she started vomiting. The hospital did admit her, thank God, and began to run tests. Her pain was excruciating. She began picking at her IV, pulling it out and becoming increasingly agitated. Blood test after blood test showed her white blood cells (WBC’s) were elevating and her red blood cells (RBC’s) which carry oxygen to her body, continued to decrease. My aunt had developed acute leukemia. We knew immediately it was fatal. “How long does she have?” we all asked the doctor. He told us several weeks but we looked at each other knowing it would only be days. We took her home, where she wanted to be, and were able to get hospice to be present 24 hours every day. This was such a relief to my cousins who had exhausted themselves by taking turns staying with her. She was made comfortable with pain medication but it was still very difficult to watch. On the day before she died, I bent down and gave her a kiss on her forehead and told her I loved her. Unbelievably, she opened her eyes, looked at me and said I love you. I very, very nearly began to sob but controlled myself as to not upset her. This was a terribly sad time for all of us.
Helping to care for both the younger generations and older generations of my family simultaneously makes me the pastrami in the middle of the generational sandwich. I love caring for people and helping them is who I am and what I believe in. Making a person’s life full of purpose and having them feel good about themselves gives me the most wonderful of feelings. Of course, I have known for a long time that I am part of what is commonly being coined the “Sandwich Generation” which makes me laugh. The humor I see in this is that we are certainly not the first generation with these circumstances and won’t be the last. I vow and so should you to keep your sense of humor, make someone smile everyday and know that when you are helping someone else you are giving yourself a gift."

However, vaccines are particularly important for older adults because as you age, your immune system weakens, and it can be more difficult to fight off infections. The older you get, the more likely you are to get diseases like the flu, pneumonia, and shingles.
Certain immunizations can help keep seniors from getting and spreading serious diseases that could result in poor health, medical bills and the inability to care for themselves. Getting vaccinated can help keep your older loved one, your family and your community healthy.
Here are three of our best posts related to immunization awareness. Helpful advice to share with the senior in your life!
Flu season will be here before we know it. Individuals should get a flu vaccine before the flu begins spreading. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people get the vaccine by the end of October. Remember, it takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies that protect against flu to develop in the body. Find out more about how to get vaccinated.

424,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/importance-good-sleep-older-adults/,"As we get older, our sleep patterns change. We spend less time in deep sleep (REM) and dreaming than we did in our youth. We may have problems falling asleep (sleep latency) or staying asleep (sleep fragmentation), sometimes waking repeatedly throughout the night. We may wake up tired and be sleepy throughout the day. So how do older adults get the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep they need each night?
We know that, at any age, we need quality rest to be healthy. Sleep allows our body to rest and restore its energy levels. Without it, we can suffer a host of sleep-deprivation problems, including depression, irritability, memory problems, difficulty concentrating, increased risk for accidents and an overall reduced quality of life. To mark National Sleep Awareness Week, let’s look at some common sleep problems associated with aging and offer some tips that may help you achieve a restful night’s sleep – this week and every week.
Sleep Problems and Aging
If you’re struggling to get the recommended hours of sleep each night, you’re not alone. Studies show that 35 percent of adults are getting less than seven hours of sleep in a 24-hour-period. Why? There are a number of common factors that can cause sleep issues for older adults, including:
- Illness or pain: Feeling sick or being in pain can make it difficult to sleep. Health conditions like arthritis can be painful and keep you awake in bed. Diabetes or an enlarged prostate can cause frequent nighttime bathroom trips.
- Medications: Some prescription drugs make it harder to fall or stay asleep, or they may even stimulate you to stay awake.
- Worry or grief. Aging brings many life changes. Losing a loved one, moving from your family home or going through an illness all can be stressful, which can hinder your sleep.
- Sleep disorders: If your sleep problems are persistent, you may have a medical disorder. See your doctor if you think you suffer from insomnia, snoring and sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, or REM behavior disorder.
- Too much downtime. Many people stay active well into their golden years. But if your days are too idle, you may find it harder to get good sleep.
Eight Tips to Improve Your Sleep
The good news is you can usually improve your quantity and quality of sleep by identifying the underlying cause of your sleep problems and making small lifestyle changes. Try these:
- Follow a regular schedule. Go to sleep and wake up at the same time each day, even on weekends. Keeping a regular sleep schedule sets the body’s circadian clock, a 24-hour internal rhythm affected by sunlight. Waking up at the same time each day is the best way to set your “internal clock,” even if you did not sleep well the night before. Sleeping in to catch up on lost sleep only perpetuates the problem.
- Develop a bedtime routine. Do the same things each night to tell your body that it’s time to wind down. Make the transition with relaxing activities an hour or so before bed, such as reading a book, listening to soothing music or soaking in a warm bath.
- Create a comfortable sleep space: A quiet, dark and cool environment can help promote sound sleep. Draw your blinds and curtains, set the room temperature to comfortably cool and use earplugs or a fan to drown out extraneous noise. Also, make sure you have a comfortable mattress and pillows. (Tip: Most mattresses wear out after 10 years.)
- Keep electronic devices out of the bedroom: The light from your television, computer, cell phone or tablet can stimulate your brain and make it difficult to fall asleep. Also, avoid stressful, stimulating activities at bedtime. If you tend to take your problems to bed, try writing them down and then putting them aside.
- Use your bedroom only for sleeping. Give yourself about 20 minutes to fall asleep. If you’re still awake and not drowsy, get out of bed. Struggling to fall sleep only leads to frustration. Go to another room and do something relaxing, like reading or listening to music until you’re tired enough to sleep.
- Avoid too much daytime napping. A 20-minute power snooze can improve your energy and help you get back to your day recharged. But long or late-day naps can be problematic for sleep sufferers. If you must nap, keep it short and before 5 p.m.
- Exercise regularly. Daily exercise improves the quality of your nighttime sleep and helps you sleep more soundly – as long as it’s done at the right time. Try to finish exercising at least three hours before bed or work out earlier in the day.
- Avoid caffeine, alcohol and cigarettes: Caffeine and nicotine are stimulants that can keep you awake and should be avoided at least four to six hours before bedtime, or entirely. Even small amounts of alcohol can make it harder to stay asleep.

425,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/important-differences-dementia-alzheimers/,"Do you know the important differences between dementia and Alzheimer’s?
Many people don’t. And the two terms often cause confusion among patients and families, as well as caregivers. The terms Dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease are often used interchangeably. While the two are similar, there are important differences between dementia and Alzheimer’s.
Dementia is a general term used to describe symptoms that affect memory, daily activities and communication abilities. It is often associated with the cognitive decline of aging. Although dementia largely affects older people, it is not a normal part of aging. According to the World Health Organization, 47.5 million people around the world are living with dementia.
Alzheimer’s disease is a very specific form – and the most common type – of dementia. It is a progressive disease that affects the parts of the brain that control thought, memory and language, and it is a disease that gets worse with time. Alzheimer’s is responsible for 50 to 70 percent of all cases of dementia.
How the Diseases Differ
Although symptoms of the two may overlap, understanding the differences between dementia and Alzheimer’s is critical for management and treatment.
Dementia
Dementia is a set of symptoms that affects mental cognitive tasks such as memory and reasoning. It often begins with incidents of forgetfulness and trouble keeping track of time. As dementia progresses, forgetfulness and confusion increase. Obvious signs of dementia include repetitive questioning, poor hygiene and bad decision-making.
Dementia is a major cause of disability and dependency among older people worldwide. It can be very difficult not only for the people who have it, but also for their caregivers and families.
There are multiple causes of dementia. Some are reversible with treatment, such as those caused by vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems and metabolic disorders. Others are irreversibly progressive. The outlook for people with dementia depends on the direct cause. For example, vascular dementia, the second most common form, can be slowed down, but still may shorten one’s lifespan. With dementia due to Parkinson’s, treatments are available to make symptoms more manageable, but this degenerative neurologic disease is an irreversible form of dementia.
Alzheimer’s Disease
Alzheimer’s is not reversible. It is a degenerative disease, and there is currently no cure available.
The symptoms of Alzheimer’s include difficulty remembering recent events or conversations, depression, impaired judgment, confusion and disorientation. Symptoms usually develop gradually and get worse over time. They eventually become severe enough to disrupt daily living.
Although younger people can and do get Alzheimer’s, the symptoms usually begin after the age of 60. The average person diagnosed with Alzheimer’s has an estimated lifespan of four to eight years after diagnosis, but some people can live with the disease for up to 20 years.
It is important to understand the differences between dementia and Alzheimer’s as treatment options vary significantly depending on the underlying cause of the dementia. If your aging loved one is experiencing symptoms of dementia, it’s important that they get medical attention as soon as possible. Your local Alzheimer’s Association Chapter can provide additional resources.

426,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/important-immunizations-seniors/,"August is Immunization Awareness Month
Vaccines are not just for children. There are important immunizations for seniors as well.
Certain immunizations can help prevent seniors from getting and spreading serious diseases that could result in poor health, medical bills and not being able to care for themselves.
In fact, some seniors may need one or more vaccines, even if they received them as a child or as a younger adult. Immunity to certain diseases can wear off over time, and as people get older, they are at an increased risk of contracting various illnesses. Some may also be at risk for vaccine-preventable disease due to age, lifestyle, travel or health conditions.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends the following vaccines for seniors to prevent:
Influenza (Flu) –
All adults need a seasonal flu vaccine every year. It is particularly important for people with chronic health conditions and older adults. More than 60 percent of seasonal flu-related hospitalizations occur in people 65 years of age and older. The CDC has established that the flu and pneumonia combined rank seventh on the list of leading causes of death among seniors 65 and older.
Shingles (Herpes Zoster) –
The shingles vaccine can significantly reduce the chances of getting shingles, a painful skin rash caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox. About half of the estimated 1 million Americans who get shingles every year are 60 and older. Therefore, the CDC recommends the vaccine for everyone 60 and older.
Diphtheria and Tetanus –
Although rare in the U.S. today, both diphtheria and tetanus are very serious diseases caused by bacteria. Diphtheria spreads from person to person through secretions from coughing or sneezing. Tetanus-causing bacteria enter the body through cuts, scratches or wounds. Adults should get a Td (tetanus, diphtheria) booster shot every 10 years to protect against both diseases.
Pertussis (Whooping Cough) –
Because pertussis may feel like a regular cold at first, an adult may not know they have it and then pass it on to someone in their family. Adult pertussis immunity wears off, putting infants at increased risk. Seniors, especially those who have close contact with infants, should receive a Tdap vaccine booster to protect against pertussis.
Pneumococcal disease (Pneumonia) –
Pneumococcal vaccines are essential because they protect against pneumococcal disease, including infections in the lungs and bloodstream. Each year in the United States, this disease kills thousands of adults, including 18,000 adults 65 and older. Thousands more end up in the hospital. The best way to prevent pneumococcal disease is by getting vaccinated.
FirstLight® Home Care understands how important immunizations are to the health and well-being of your senior family members. Our caregivers can help seniors during Immunization Awareness Month by:
- Assisting them before, during and after the vaccination appointment
- Providing transportation to and from the appointment
- Filling prescriptions on the way home
- Providing companionship to ensure there are no negative side effects from the vaccine(s)
- Reminding them to follow post-visit care plans provided by their doctor
If you are unsure which important immunizations are right for your senior parent, ask their doctor. You also can use this Adult Immunization Vaccine Finder to receive personalized vaccine recommendations based on your age, health status, location and other factors.

428,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/in-the-news-firstlight-franchisee-offers-tips-for-seniors-on-social-media/,"An increasing number of seniors are turning to social media as a way to connect with family and friends. Social media can provide a safe and easy way for seniors to stay updated and connected with family members – especially with loved ones that live out-of-state. Websites like Facebook can provide seniors who might be feeling lonely with a good sense of companionship.
FirstLight franchisee Michael LaVell was featured this week in Michigan Senior Living and provided expert commentary on ways seniors can utilize social media safely. Here are some things to keep in mind when getting your senior familiar with social media.
1. Depending on how computer savvy the senior is, make it a point to sit down with your elder and walk him/her through the steps of setting up an account. Whether it be Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn, spend time helping them navigate the website’s step-by-step welcoming instructions.
2. Once the account is setup, practice logging on with your elder. If it makes it easier to remember, write down the username and log-in information and keep it in a secured place. You could even spend a nice afternoon helping them fill out their profile information and uploading photos.
3. Encourage out-of-state family members to create a blog so family everywhere can log on and see what’s going on in their lives. It’s a great way for your senior to stay connected and blogs are free and easy to set up.
4. Not only can social media sites be very fun and a great way to stay connected, it’s important to make sure you have the appropriate privacy settings on their account. Making their Facebook page only visible to friends and family is a good way to protect their security and avoid potential scams.
5. Remind seniors not to give out too much personal information on their profiles that potential criminals could obtain. Identity information such as their address and cell phone number are not things they need to include with their contact information. The city of residence and email address is enough information to allow your senior to connect with others yet maintain security.
6. Make sure your elderly loved ones know not to open emails or attachments from people they don’t know. Inform them that some attachments could contain a virus and infect their computer."

430,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/in-the-news-firstlights-director-of-client-services-gina-kaurich-discusses-seniors-who-bully/,"Msnbc.com published an article this week that brought much needed attention to the issue of senior bullying. FirstLight’s director of client services, Gina Kaurich, lent her expertise on the matter. As a previous director of nursing at an assisted living facility she has seen how far senior bullying can go. According to Kaurich, there is a type of caste system among residents in many nursing home facilities that can exacerbate the mistreatment of seniors in the home.
There is little research on elderly bullying but senior care experts estimate about 10-20 percent of seniors have experienced some type of aggression in a care institution; much of it verbal abuse from other senior residents. Here is an informational article on how to identify signs of elder abuse from HelpGuide.org, a non-profit resource that offers support and the knowledge needed to make healthy life choices.
The most important thing you can do if you think your elderly loved one is suffering from neglect or abuse, either from a fellow senior resident or caregiver, is to remove them from the situation and entrust in a professional caregiver like the ones offered through FirstLight."
431,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/is-it-time-to-take-the-car-keys-away/,"One of the hardest discussions you will have with your senior parents is to recommend they stop driving. Taking the keys away can be a very traumatic event for them, because it means a loss of independence and freedom. Unfortunately, many older individuals continue to drive even after they realize they are less than capable.
Even in the best of circumstances and at any age, driving can be a demanding, mentally exhaustive experience! Your vision, dexterity, hearing and reflexes have to be keen. Drivers over 75 have the second-highest rate, after teenagers, of fatal crashes per
mile driven, according to Federal Highway Administration data.
Here are some tips from FirstLight Home Care to make taking the keys away from your parents as stress free as possible:
- Take a few casual drives with your parents so you can see first-hand what their driving skills are like. Say your car needs some work and you need a ride, so they don’t automatically feel threatened. Are they confused? Do they get lost a lot or get nervous in heavy traffic? Do they frequently hit curbs? This will give you the opportunity to assess their driving abilities.
- Take them for an eye exam and talk to the eye doctor beforehand. Is their vision good enough to be driving? How about their hearing? Talk to their family physician about their reflex times.
- Approach the conversation slowly and with dignity and compassion. Unless there has been an accident, let them get used to the idea of not driving anymore. Plan a gradual curtailment of driving. Suggest that they drive less, maybe shorter distances or even eliminate night driving.
- Some states require older drivers to re-take a driver’s test or suggest a class to sharpen their skills. AARP and many local hospitals offer special classes for senior drivers. The classes review the rules of the road and special situations seniors should be aware of. Some insurance companies give discounts to seniors who take these classes.
- Discuss alternative transportation. Don’t leave your parents without an option to get around, run errands, go shopping, or get to their doctor appointments. You, your siblings, neighbors or friends can volunteer to be their chauffeur. The Department on Aging, some churches, and most hospitals offer transportation services for seniors and the handicapped. Some shopping centers also have buses that will pick up seniors for free, drive them to the mall, and then home. There are taxi companies that offer senior discounts. Work out the logistics of transportation for them before you take away the keys and they feel stranded. Homebound seniors are more depressed, lonelier and may decline in health more rapidly, so it’s important for them to get out and about.
- Discuss the financial savings of no longer driving – no auto insurance (which increases with age) and no car repairs. Remove the temptation by removing the car from their house. Don’t hide the keys – they’ll find them. Help them decide who to give their car to – maybe a beloved grandson or favorite niece would be a good recipient.
What do you do if your parents absolutely refuse to give up their keys no matter how much you talk about their safety? Unfortunately, this is where tough love comes in. When all else fails, remove access to the car. Or have an objective third party talk to them, such as their
family physician, a minister or a respected friend. Although this can be difficult, you could be saving lives in the end, including your parent’s."
432,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/isolation-and-depression-in-older-adults/,"The holidays – and the many visitors and activities that come with them – have come and gone. And for many older adults, the looming question is, “Now what?” The post-holiday season can be especially challenging for older adults who are already dealing with isolation. The sudden and dramatic change in their environment when activities wane and loved ones leave after the holidays can have a profound impact on their mental health.
A very real problem for the aging population
As the population of adults 65 and older continues to explode, we’re learning more about the impacts of isolation. As they age, many older adults are less mobile, have less contact with their social circles and are less likely to connect with family on a regular basis. The impact? Prolonged isolation. According to AARP, isolation is about more than feelings of loneliness in seniors who may live independently. Rather, it’s the result of feeling detached – physically or psychologically – or being disconnected from support groups of family, friends and community. Isolation is becoming so common that the AARP Foundation recently launched a new website – Connect2Affect – dedicated to helping older adults and their loved ones minimize the incidence and impact of isolation.
The Connect2Affect website identifies five primary causes of isolation:
- Transportation challenges, particularly lack of accessible and affordable transportation options, leading older adults to become housebound
- Poor health and well-being, such as untreated hearing loss, lack of mobility or poor mental health
- Life transitions, role loss or change, such as loss of a partner or friends or leaving the workforce
- Societal barriers, such as ageism and lack of opportunities for older adults to engage and contribute
- Lack of access, often caused by poverty, rural living or inequality for minority groups
Recent stories in The New York Times and Forbes explored the correlation between isolation and a person’s physical and mental health. AARP suggests the health risks of prolonged isolation are equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes per day. One of the most significant areas of impact can be on the isolated individual’s mental health.
A common health issue that isn’t a “normal” part of aging
Changes in an older adult’s mental health – specifically depression – can be difficult to recognize. Why? Because the individuals themselves often don’t talk about how they’re feeling. And their loved ones often dismiss the symptoms of depression as a “normal” part of growing older, or they mistake the symptoms as signs of chronic health conditions, such as dementia.
While the aging process – and many of the health issues and medications that come with it – can trigger mental health issues, depression in older adults is not normal. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), untreated depression in older adults can increase risk of illness and contribute to cognitive decline. NAMI notes that symptoms of depression in older adults can differ from other populations, and may include:
- Memory problems
- Confusion
- Difficulty concentrating or making decisions
- Delusions
- Hallucinations
- Persistent and vague complaints, often of pain
- Feelings of worthlessness, helplessness or extreme guilt
- Social withdrawal and/or loss of interest or pleasure in activities
- Irritability
- Unexplained help-seeking behaviors
- Demanding behaviors
- Lack of energy
- Disturbed sleep or inability to sleep
- Slow or lethargic movements
- Lack of attention to personal care or hygiene
- Loss of appetite
- Weight loss or gain
Prolonged feelings of isolation, the post-holiday transition and even the change in seasons can intensify these symptoms.
Solutions for older adults – and the people who love them
The most important step for decreasing isolation and improving mental health for older adults is recognizing the issues. A variety of screening tools can help validate concerns:
- This AARP assessment tool can help individuals understand personal occurrence of isolation, as well as how significant a problem it is
- This confidential screening tool from Mental Health America can help determine the likelihood an individual is suffering from depression, based on specific symptoms
Once isolation is identified, there are many proactive steps that can help minimize its severity and impact. And a depression diagnosis can help enable the treatment older adults need to overcome their symptoms. Some ideas for combatting both issues include:
- Plan regular visits with or social outings for older adults
- Include older adults in family activities
- Identify resources for transportation, companionship and/or assistance with daily needs
- Join a support group, senior center/program or class
- Renew focus on a hobby or cherished activity
- Reconnect with old friends
- Participate in physical activities such as walking, meditation, Tai Chi or Yoga
- Spend time outdoors, when weather permits
- Invest in aromatherapy or massage
- Get adequate sleep
- Enlist the help of a professional via therapy or ongoing treatment

433,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/it-takes-a-village/,"Guilt, I’m discovering, is a huge part of this aging thing. Our parent feels guilt for putting us out, frets about being a burden, worries about picking up the phone to ask for help. We the adult children question our decisions, second-guess our actions, and feel guilt for all we can’t do.
I feel similar guilt with my preschool-aged children—worrying about their school, wondering if I’m reading enough books, stressing because they like only one vegetable. But with young children, it’s ok—even expected—to ask for help. You hire a babysitter when you need a break, send them to an afterschool program when you’re stuck late at work, or you get your neighbor to watch them while you run to the grocery store. “It takes a village to raise a child,” we’re told, and so we use that village.
With aging, the adult emotions of pride, embarrassment, shame, and loss get involved, and we’re suddenly incapable of asking for help. We feel it’s a betrayal to share with an outsider our loved one’s struggle or we’re in denial that we even need help. We think it’s abandonment to enlist someone else’s help in caring for our spouse or parents, or if we’re the aging person himself, we’re too embarrassed or proud to ask for help.
A friend of mine from Africa recently described to me his frustration with the way we deal with aging in America. Where he grew up, aging wasn’t a big issue because it was openly dealt with. Families were huge, and he grew up from an early age knowing the importance of elders and taking care of them. Aging loved ones aren’t embarrassed to ask for help, and full communities of people aren’t reluctant to give it.
The reality is it takes a village to care for our seniors. We have that village here already—with our senior center, GLSS and North Shore Elder Services, home care providers, various assisted living and nursing facilities, and many other resources available to people—but we’re usually too embarrassed/scared/frustrated/confused to use them. Imagine how much easier it would be if everyone went around saying, “It takes a village,” in reference to caring for our aging loved ones as much as they say it about our raising our little ones. We’d all have permission to ask for help, and we’d all feel an obligation to provide it.
With Thanksgiving here and the winter approaching, this may be the time of year aging loved ones and their families need help the most. Whether you’re in a position of needing help or not, you can always be on the lookout to offer it. Check in on an older neighbor (or better yet, join her for tea), call a friend who’s caring for his aging parent, offer to stand in line at the post office to mail a senior’s packages, volunteer to serve lunch at the senior center. It truly does take a village, and that village starts with us.

While many of us have no trouble being active in the great outdoors, seniors often pass up the chance to get fresh air due to mobility issues or lack of companionship. If you’re able, set aside a few days this fall season for the elderly loved ones in your life and make an effort to help them enjoy one of the more simple things in life—nature.
Offer to escort them on walks through nearby nature trails or parks in their neighborhood. If they are wheelchair-bound or have limited mobility, suggest a color tour and take them on a drive one sunny afternoon. Carving pumpkins and baking homemade pumpkin seeds is also a safe and easy way to entertain older adults—it’s also a great activity grandchildren can get involved in.
It’s important to consider your senior’s interests and what they are physically capable of. An entire day outdoors can be exhausting. Check your local paper or community news website to check for senior-friendly events in your area. Taking the time to plan an outing will ensure the elderly in your life get the best fall experience possible!"
436,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/june-is-national-safety-month/,"Injuries are a leading cause of disability for people of all ages — and they are the leading cause of death for Americans ages 1 to 44. The good news is everyone can get involved to help prevent injuries.
During National Safety Month, FirstLight Home Care will be utilizing Facebook and Twitter to promote ways families can help reduce the risk of injuries. This June, we encourage you to learn more about important safety issues like prescription painkiller abuse, transportation safety, and slips, trips, and falls.
Prescription painkiller abuse: Prescription painkiller overdoses are a growing problem in the United States, especially among women. About 18 women die every day from a prescription painkiller overdose — more than 4 times as many as back in 1999.
Transportation safety: Doing other activities while driving — like texting or eating — distracts you and increases your chance of crashing. Almost 1 in 5 crashes (17%) that injure someone involves distracted driving.
Slips, trips, and falls: The National Institute in Aging states that 1 in 3 older adults fall each year. Many falls lead to broken bones and other health problems.
You can make a difference. Find out ways to help reduce the risk of these safety issues and more by checking out FirstLight Home Care’s Health & Wellness blog posts."
437,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/keep-seniors-active-during-covid-19/,"Caregiving during COVID-19 has been a challenge both for family caregivers and for their loved ones.
Social isolation and loneliness have played a big part in these challenges as isolating during the pandemic has hit the elderly population especially hard.
Isolation for those over the age of 60 has serious medical and psychological effects and can lead to depression, heart disease, anxiety and cognitive decline. Another factor that adds to these issues is chronic loneliness because more and more seniors live alone.
But caregivers can keep seniors active and engaged during COVID-19 without putting them at risk:
- Cheer them up by visiting to give them a care package
- Set them up for video chatting
- Help them engage and connect on social media
- Get them outdoors

438,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/keep-your-brain-sharp-and-healthy-with-5-small-changes/,"Are you getting more forgetful? We all have occasional lapses, especially once we hit our forties. It might be alarming to you to have a “senior moment” now and then, but the good news is that research shows that by keeping your brain healthy with the right diet and “brain” exercise, you can keep your cognitive function strong – boosting your memory and brainpower. Here are five things you can do to stay sharp.
Eat Fish: People who eat fish once a week have a 60% lower risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (research by Martha Clare Morris, ScD.). The reason is DHA, a type of omega-3 fatty acid found in large quantities in the brain and in cold water species of fish, such as salmon, tuna, and cod. A weekly seafood-based meal may slow cognitive decline by 10% per year (the equivalent of turning back the clock 3 to 4 years).
Try Something New: Mental stimulation is good for the brain. As we grow older, we tend to engage in the same activities and behavior patterns. This is boring to the brain. When we mentally challenge ourselves on a regular basis, we can maintain good intellectual potential as well as reduce our risk for age-related memory loss. Give your mind a workout with fun brain games – like Sudoku.
Exercise: One important way to increase your brain health is through regular exercise. Cardiovascular activity will pump more oxygen-rich blood to the brain. With the blood comes nutrients such as glucose, which fuel every cell in the brain.
Embrace the Power of a Nap: We love this. Take a 20 minute nap during the day to give your brain a rest. It will help you with recall and improve your memory."
439,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/keeping-a-thankful-journal/,"It is an annual tradition in our family to go around the Thanksgiving table and have everyone express one thing they are thankful for. One of my favorites is when my nephew said he was thankful he didn’t have to clean up the mess!
But too soon, Thanksgiving is behind us, the stomach ache from eating too much turkey is long gone and the rat race begins anew. We get caught up in the stress, the negative feelings the holidays can elicit and we forget about all the good things.
For instance, this is my first holiday season without my Mom. We called her the “crazy Christmas lady” because she loved the holidays so much. I spent 54 Christmas’s with her … never missed a one. She taught us that the true meaning of Christmas was in giving not receiving and made sure we filled the holidays with charitable acts. So there is a hole in my heart this holiday season, one that could easily drag me down.
So I have two choices: drown my sorrows in pints of Hagen Dasz and be depressed or develop anattitude of gratitude. So knowing that the holidays could be difficult, I started a “thankful journal” on November 1. Sounds cheesy I know, but it works.
It is too easy in life to focus on the negatives – not enough time, never enough money, kid problems, job hassles and more. Like the tape we secure our holiday packages with, it’s like we get stuck on the cons instead of the pros. Sure we were thankful on Thanksgiving, but what about the other 364 days?
I can’t take credit for the idea of a thankful journal. It’s been around a long time. The concept is relatively simple. Every night before I go to bed, I write down one thing I am thankful for. Sometimes it’s small things like when my teenager cleaned up his dishes without having been told. Other times it’s bigger things like when I took my car into be fixed expecting a large bill and only owed $75 or when my sciatica flared up but quickly went away.
The outcome? It forces me to focus on the positive. To be grateful for some things I may have taken for granted. And to celebrate small victories.
If you’ve read the book “The Secret” it’s based on the notion that positive thoughts attract positive actions. Probably true. I do know this: knowing I have to write one good thing in my journal down nightly makes me more aware of the good things that are happening in my life throughout the day.
My entry for November 1? “There was a little girl at Walgreens today buying her Mom a birthday present. She thought she had enough money and counted up all the change she had been saving for a bottle of perfume but came up short. There was pennies, nickles and dimes spread all over the counter. She started crying, but I quickly handed the clerk the remainder she owed. Her smile was priceless. Thanks Mom for teaching me what’s important!”
Sometimes it’s the simple things."
440,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/keeping-aging-parents-home-safe/,"June is National Safety Month. It is important to keep everyone safe, especially when it comes to your aging parents living independently at home.
FirstLight Home Care put together a list of home safety tips to help aging parents prevent falls and accidents in their homes.
Start with the outside of your parents’ home. Walk around the home to check out the condition of sidewalks, handrails, lighting and vegetation or shrubs. Uneven sidewalks, loose handrails, poor lighting and overgrown landscaping could become a trip hazard. Move or put away outdoor furniture, flower pots, and gardening tools that could obstruct their pathway.
Secure all points of entry. Inspect all windows and doors for weak or faulty locking mechanisms. Make sure your parents know how to work the locks properly. As warmer weather approaches, secure window air conditioning units with a metal bracket, sliding window locks or steel corner braces to prevent them from being pushed into or pulled out of the home. Make sure your parents are locking all windows and doors and that they are not leaving a back door unlocked or a window open when they’re not at home, home alone, or at night before they go to bed.
Check exterior lighting. The front porch lights should be strong enough to illuminate the entrance and front yard. Other lighting around the exterior – near the garage, backdoor or alley – should also be lit. Motion sensors to exterior lights can be helpful because they don’t require your parents to remember to turn them on or off.
Move inside and check around the home. This is the place your aging parents will spend most of their time. It is important to check the accessibility of all rooms in their home. Make sure furniture is not obstructing walkways. Remove throw rugs to avoid tripping. Re-position floor lamps so that they don’t trip on the cords. Purchase nightlights and place them throughout the house in case they get up at night. Clear away all things from the floor – pet toys and bedding, stacks of newspapers or magazines. Make sure stairs have handrails on both sides and that both ends of the stairs are clearly marked (top and bottom). Check that smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are working.
Once you have assessed the exterior and interior of the home and made necessary adjustments, it’s now time to talk to your parents about home safety. Walk them through the changes that have been made, discuss their needs and concerns about their safety while living independently at their home, and continue to modify and discuss their needs as time goes on."
441,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/keeping-in-shape-for-national-nutrition-month/,"Between work and home life, there never seems to be enough hours in the day to pay attention to the little things (that can have a big impact!) like nutrition. Combined with increasingly sedentary lifestyles, this unhealthy trend has led to an overweight problem in America where 78 million U.S. adults are considered obese.
To address this, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has designated March National Nutrition Month 2016 so Americans, young and old, can “savor the flavor of eating right.” So, if you are looking to get healthy with your own food or want to set a good example for the people you care for, here are some great tips to get in shape for national nutrition month:
- Don’t skip breakfast: If you think skipping breakfast is an easy way to slim down this month, think again. Starting your day with a balance of lean protein, whole grains, fruits and even vegetables, can keep you satisfied until lunch and give you the energy needed to fuel your morning. It also helps you eat less in the evenings to balance your daily intake of calories.
- Expand your palate: We understand that you and your loved ones may think healthy food has to be bland, but if you simply expand your palate, you’ll discover a whole array of tasty options that can benefit your vitality. Try something different, vibrant and full of beneficial micronutrients and you might find your new favorite food. Kale, anyone?
- Cook more: While eating out or getting fast food can save you time, it can cost you calories – 65 percent more than the average home-cooked meal. Fast food also tends to have a significantly higher amount of trans fats, which can increase your chance of heart disease. Cooking nice, healthy meals is ideal, but it can be time consuming, especially if you’re taking care of an older loved one. This is where non-medical in-home caregivers can help.
- Love your food in smaller amounts: As we get older, our bodies need fewer calories to maintain a healthy body weight. This means portion control is a big factor in staying in shape. Adding fiber-rich foods like fruits and vegetables to your meals is a great way to keep you full longer.
At FirstLight Home Care, we understand that maintaining your diet can be tough, especially if you’re also caring for a loved one at home. This is why we work with families to help develop special diets, eating schedules and meal preparations designed with your health in mind. If you want to learn more about National Nutrition Month, visit www.EatRight.org to get more nutrition tips today. For information on personal care services, such as meal preparation assistance that can help your loved ones enjoy regular balanced meals, contact your local FirstLight Home Care location."

We did some homework and found some pretty simple tips to help keep everyone in your family cool this summer:
- Stay hydrated: Drink cool drinks, preferably water.
- Stay indoors during the hottest parts of the day, which is typically 11:00 am to 3:00 pm.
- To keep your rooms cool, close your blinds. Only open windows when it’s cool enough to do so.
- Head downstairs. Hot air rises. A lower floor or basement can be a cool refuge from the midday heat.
- Spend the day where there is air conditioning. Stop by a local library, community center, or shopping center where it is cooler.
- Eliminate extra sources of heat. Incandescent light bulbs can generate unnecessary heat, and so can computers and appliances. Turn them off in you don’t need them.
- Place a bowl of ice cubes in front of a fan to generate cooler air. Remember to be careful when placing anything near electrical and/or on the floor so that you or others don’t trip and get hurt.

443,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/keys-healthy-aging/,"September is Healthy Aging Month
Aging is a natural part of life. With it comes many challenges, both physically and mentally. Sometimes there are surprises and uncertainties, and occasionally there are changes in our bodies and minds we just don’t want to face. Yet, as we age, it becomes even more important to take control of our own health and focus on healthy aging.
Now is the time! September is Healthy Aging® Month, an annual observance aimed at focusing national attention on the positive aspects of growing older… a chance to encourage us to take personal responsibility for our health… physically, socially, mentally. So, what are the keys to healthy aging?
Keep moving. Regular exercise is key. Living an active lifestyle will keep you fit and help you maintain a healthy weight. You might even find that you sleep better. Regular exercise may also prevent or provide relief from common chronic conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, depression and arthritis. When you choose to move, make sure it’s something you enjoy so it doesn’t end up feeling like a chore.
Eat nutritious foods. Eating a healthy, balanced diet can not only make you feel great, it can help fight certain diseases. Opt for fresh fruits and vegetables and clean proteins. Ditch the junk food and avoid sweet, salty, highly-processed foods. Try some of these delicious, healthy fall recipes from Tasting the Seasons cookbook.
Get enough Zzzzzzz. Did you know that humans can go longer without food than without sleep? That’s a frightening fact. Make sure you get the sleep your body needs – that’s usually seven to nine hours per night for older adults. Lack of sleep can also cause irritability, increased fall risk and memory issues.
Prevent and protect. Keep up with regular well visits with your doctor, dentist and optometrist. Make sure to take all medications as directed by your physician. And make sure you know which immunizations you need to stay protected. In addition to a seasonal flu vaccine, which all adults need every year, there are many other important vaccines for seniors.
Challenge your brain. Some cognitive decline, such as in memory and thinking skills, is a normal part of aging. Studies have shown that a lifestyle that includes cognitive stimulation through active learning slows this cognitive decline. Do something good and stimulating for your brain like assembling a puzzle, learning a foreign language or learning to play a musical instrument.
Stay social. Stay connected to friends and family by being social. Schedule a regular time to have lunch, go for a walk or meet for coffee. Join a book club, paint pottery or volunteer with your favorite organization. Stay social and keep it fun!

445,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/knowing-your-parents-last-wishes/,"Talking with your parents about their last wishes can be a touchy subject. Chances are, it’s harder on you than them! It’s a subject that can’t be avoided, however, because there are some very important financial and emotional implications. The more you plan ahead — before someone is in a hospital bed or incapacitated – the better.
A study by the Hartford insurance company revealed that seniors are much more comfortable discussing estate planning than their boomer kids are! The study also revealed that 70-something year-old parents are more financially savvy when it comes to protecting their children and grandkids financially than boomers realize. They’re also more open to estate planning advice than their kids think they’ll be.
Here’s some basics about your parents last wishes you should know:
- Know their social security numbers. As simple as this sounds, your parent’s
social security numbers are a key to answering some important financial questions.
- Know your parent’s doctors, medications and health insurance coverage. Know who your parents’ doctors are and write down all their prescription medications. This way if a parent has to go to an emergency room, and he or she cannot directly communicate, you can tell healthcare professionals what prescriptions your parent is taking and is he/she has any allergies. Know their health insurance and policy numbers in case you need to contact providers or pay bills.
- Do they have valid will? Make sure your parents have an up-to-date will. If not, their money could be tied about in probate, an expensive process that involves lawyers, courts and the IRS. Without a properly executed will, the government could end up getting more money than your family does!
- Do they have a durable power of attorney? Should your parents become incapacitated, it’s important to have a durable power of attorney so a designated individual can pay the bills.
- Do they have a health care proxy, so someone is designated to make
medical decisions if your parents can’t?
- Do they have a living will (also known as an advanced care directive)? This way you will know your parent’s wishes in regards to resuscitation, transfusions, test, surgery, medications and organ donations.
- Make sure beneficiaries are chosen. Who gets Mom’s jewelry or family heirlooms? To prevent family feuds, the more that is spelled out in the will regarding property, bank accounts and IRAs, the better.
- Funeral arrangements. It’s hard to talk about this in advance, but it’s important to know your parent’s burial wishes. Many parents have pre-paid their funeral expenses, so it’s important to know where all the paperwork is. Additionally,some elderly parents have life insurance policies that pay for funeral arrangements or pay out an amount to a beneficiary. Do your parents want to be cremated or buried? What are their religious wishes? When your parents pass away, it is an extremely emotional time – knowing their wishes in advance can help ease some of the stress.
If your parents have not taken care of their estate planning, it’s important to sit down with them and prepare some of the documents for them. Depending on the value of their estate, an estate attorney may need to be involved. If not, forms for simple wills can be found on the Internet.
If your parents say that their financial affairs — and estate plans — are none of your business, at least try to find out where their various papers are located (e.g., their will, power of attorney, funeral plans, bank accounts, property deeds, insurance policies, car registrations, etc.) This can save you a lot of stress!"
446,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/last-minute-gift-ideas-fathers-day/,"“It is a wise father that knows his own child.” For many fathers, this quote from William Shakespeare speaks volumes when it comes time to celebrate Father’s Day. Whether you are a Father, a Dad, a Daddy or any combination of these ideas, being a father can take on many roles, all of which are cause for joy during this special “Day for Dad!”
As caregivers, we know that a Dad plays an intricate role in the dynamic of a family and for those whose fathers are aging, seeing this strong authority figure in a different light can be a time of conflicting emotions. If you still haven’t gotten the patriarch in your family a gift for Father’s Day next weekend, here are some last-minute thoughts on how you can show appreciation for Dad:
- Take the time to listen: Fathers, especially those who are seniors, can be filled with stories from their own experiences that they haven’t shared with you. Shut off your phone and sit with them to let them open up with memories from their younger days. Not only will this give you insight that you can use for your own life, but allowing them to share their memories can help them remain aware.
- Do something together that they love: Whether it is a sporting event, listening to music, going fishing or even a favorite place to eat, let your Dad decide what the day should be all about. If Dad is not able to get around easily, find a favorite movie, show or sporting event that you can watch together.
- Technology: If you have a senior Dad that loves technology, offer them some new products that they might enjoy. Fill a digital music player with some favorite tunes, download some fun new apps or even offer a personalized coupon for a few hours of “technology training” to assist Dad with computer or technology updates.
- Get the family together: Nothing says togetherness like bringing the entire family together. Sons, daughters, grandchildren, sisters, brothers and everyone in your extended family being able to be a part of Father’s Day can bring joy to everyone on this special day!
- A day for Dad: While there are some fathers that may enjoy the idea of relaxing at a spa for the day, there are others that won’t, but it doesn’t mean you can’t do something special. Take them to a barber shop for a haircut and a shave and help Dad look spiffy for Father’s Day!
Appreciating your Dad on Father’s Day doesn’t mean you have to get them a tie or another pair of socks. Showing a Dad what they mean to you by spending quality time together, doing something that they love or just taking care of them for the day will help create memories that will mean more than you may imagine. If you have a Dad, grandfather or other family member who you think of as your Dad, who is at a place in their lives where they need assistance, the culture of care at FirstLight Home Care can help put your mind at ease.

447,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/law-aims-involve-caregivers-of-veterans/,"FirstLight Home Care recently learned of news regarding the National Defense Authorization Act of 2018 and additional assistance for veterans and caregivers of veterans. The following information was published on ConnectingVets.com:
Thanks to the National Defense Authorization Act of 2018, service members who are transitioning out of the military will have more assistance for them and their caregivers. Currently, caregivers of veterans are not involved when veterans are going through pre-counseling to learn about their VA benefits.
The new law encourages the DoD and VA to work together to better integrate caregivers into the conversation around veteran’s and caregiver’s resources during military separation. It requires the DoD to ask service members who are in pre-separation counseling to identify if they have a caregiver. If they do, then the caregiver becomes part of the conversation to help veterans understand what resources they can utilize, what they can apply for, and how they can support the health, wellness and reintegration of their veteran.
We sat down with our own CEO, Jeff Bevis, to get his take on this new progress. Here is what he said:
“We applaud the recent National Defense Authorization Act of 2018. It aims to give greater awareness and importance to caregivers of veterans earlier in the process of service members transitioning out of the military. It also provides the additional steps needed to effectively present each veteran with their VA benefits.
In serving veterans and their families, caregivers are often left out of the dialogue and are not included in discussions regarding VA benefits. This creates information gaps and often results in widening gaps where VA benefits could help with health, medical or social services. Many times, the full benefits have not been presented or are not retained by the veteran during the transition process.
These “benefit gaps” are very often avoidable and, if communicated more effectively upfront during the transition process, will most certainly lead to fewer challenges for these veterans and their families.
On behalf of our entire FirstLight organization serving thousands of veterans and their families across the country, we are excited to remind and better enable transitioning veterans and their families to utilize the new assistance provided in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2018.”

449,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/lifestyle-how-being-optimistic-will-help-you-live-longer/,"Is your glass half full or half empty? How you see your life could impact how long you live. Research from Health News has reported that the more optimistic you are the better it will help you live a longer, healthier life.
The study shows that older people who described themselves as highly optimistic have a lower risk of heart disease or death from any cause over nearly 10 years compared with people who are very pessimistic. Researchers say depression has long been known to increase the risk of death due to heart disease, but less is known about the effects of an optimistic attitude.
In the study, researchers surveyed about 1,000 men and women aged 65-85 about their health, morale, optimism, self-respect, and relationships. Based on the participants’ answers about optimism, researchers divided them into four groups according to their level of optimism.
After nearly 10 years of follow-up, researchers found that compared with people who reported a high level of pessimism, those who were very optimistic had a 55% lower risk of death from all causes and a 23% lower risk of heart-related death.
The study also showed that optimism’s protective effect was stronger in men than in women for reducing the risk of death due to any cause except heart-related death.
Researchers say there are several factors that may explain the link between optimism and longer life. For example:
- Optimism is associated with more physical activity, moderate alcohol use in women, and less smoking.
- Optimism is associated with better health in general. People in poor health tend to report more pessimism.
- Optimists may cope with stress differently and more effectively than pessimists do.

450,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/limited-engagement-short-term-home-care/,"Chances are you’re already aware that non-medical home care is growing in popularity as a way to help older adults age in place – over the long term – while maintaining their quality of life. But you may not know that home care can also provide short-term assistance for adults ages 18 and older who need temporary companionship or support with the activities of daily living.
One of the most frequently asked questions to our Just Ask FirstLight service is whether non-medical home care can be provided on a short-term, episodic or as-needed basis. And the answer is a resounding yes! You don’t have to commit to a long-term relationship to take advantage of the benefits of non-medical home care. A limited home care engagement can last anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, and care delivery can be scheduled around the clock or for as little as the time it takes to complete a few defined tasks – and every increment in between.
Providing a Boost – For What You Need the Most
Short-term home care can provide vital support during what can be a challenging and stressful time for individuals and their family caregivers. And while the presence of a professional caregiver during these engagements may be temporary, the impact can be more enduring. Home care can provide a long-term boost to what you may need most – comfort, confidence and peace of mind. In the words of business consultant and author Idowu Koyenikan, “Even though your time on the job is temporary, if you do a good enough job, your work there will last forever.”
Delivering Support – Whenever It’s Needed
A temporary home care engagement can be valuable during times of recuperation and recovery, after an injury or during a significant life transition. Personal Care Services can provide assistance with the activities of daily living, such as bathing, mobility, meal preparation and more. Companion Care Services can also provide support through light housekeeping and laundry, errands and transportation, medication reminders and even visits from caregivers to keep a client company. Among the many times Personal Care and Companion Care services can deliver needed short-term support are:
- When dealing with a short-term health issue, such as an illness, injury or recovery from surgery
- When a family caregiver who typically provides support is temporarily unavailable
- When adjusting to a major life change, such as moving into a new home or transitioning after the death of a loved one
- When getting settled in with a new baby or other family member
When short-term home care is related to recuperation after a hospital stay, it can have an added benefit – the reduction of hospital readmissions. For FirstLight Home Care clients, our Readmission Rescue Program is a value-add service that’s part of non-medical home care packages. The program helps reduce hospital readmission rates by putting trained certified nursing assistants (CNAs) on the lookout for symptoms or other indications that a client who’s recovering may have a health problem related to a recent hospital stay. Through detailed monitoring, reporting and appropriate physician intervention, issues can be addressed proactively to ensure clients get the care they need – before their condition forces another hospital stay.
Supporting the Caregiver – When It’s Time to Recharge
Another short-term option that’s designed to provide support specifically to family caregivers is Respite Care. Such services allow caregivers to step out of their daily support roles to take time to relax, reflect and refresh. Professional caregivers can assist loved ones – for a couple of hours, an entire day or even overnight.

451,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/live-longer-and-stronger-tips-to-healthy-aging/,"Our friends over at the National Institute of Aging have put together a pretty awesome list of benefits that as you age, healthy eating and exercise can improve the following:
- Increase mental acuteness
- Help resist disease and injury
- Offer faster recovery
- Yield higher energy levels
- Boost a functioning immune system
- Provide better management of chronic health problems
So what can you do?First, speak to your doctor about your current eating and exercise routine. Get their recommendations. The National Institute of Aging promotes these basic things: Eat smart – less salt, more fiber, more fruits and veggies. Add exercise into your daily schedule (30 minutes). Drink plenty of liquids like water, juice, milk, and soup. Don’t wait until you feel thirsty. Try to add liquids throughout the day. Don’t smoke. Get plenty of sleep each night. Don’t drink or drink in moderation.
At FirstLight Home Care we believe in eating right and getting our daily exercise. We know from our own Nurse Gina that how we care for ourselves today will help us age gracefully.
Start today. What else do you feel healthier eating and exercise do for you? Feel free to leave us a comment."
452,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/living-a-purpose-filled-life-at-any-age/,"Molly Rowe owns FirstLight Home Care of Salem, MA with her husband, Steve, and lives in Swampscott with their two sons.
Of all the things that baffled us about our dad’s (my dad-in-law’s) behavior in the last few years of his life, there’s one thing that stands out most of all. It wasn’t that he started freezing all his food (including his butter) or sleeping in a chair every night. It was that he stopped doing crossword puzzles.
Crossword puzzles were a mainstay in his house after his wife died of cancer in 1991. He had a special clipboard for the weekly puzzle, a favorite pencil, and seemed to savor the process of solving them. On holidays, we’d pass the clipboard around in a group effort to finish the puzzle (I’m embarrassed to admit it sometimes took all five of us).
Looking back, this simple change could have had major implications but we didn’t think about it at the time. It may have been that he was having memory trouble or problems coming up with the words. It may have been his eyes were bothering him or his hand was shaking too much to write. Or it may just have been he was depressed—probably the most likely reason—after he suffered a heart attack and turned 80.
Such a simple thing—those crossword puzzles—not exactly saving the world, but they may have been his reason for getting out of bed (or out of his chair) each day. The end of those puzzles marked a turn in his aging. And an end to what some call a “purpose-filled life.”
When you’re caring for someone, giving his life “purpose” often takes a backseat to providing care. You’re just trying to get him (and you) through the basic parts of daily living. But, while maintaining that purpose gets harder and harder, especially if your loved one lives alone, having a purpose makes them live longer, healthier lives.
So, what can you do to ensure your parent or other aging loved one has that purpose? If he is well enough to leave the home, he could be well enough to volunteer. Volunteering doesn’t have to be standing on her feet for six hours, serving soup. It could be reading books to kids at the YMCA preschool, manning the welcome gate at Winter Island, or greeting people at church.
There are a ton of fun resources at the Swampscott Senior Center where seniors can play poker, for example, and connect with friends. (And if your mom or dad doesn’t drive, there are many local people, including FirstLight, who will help get them ready, drive them there, and stay until they’re done.)
If your parent or loved one isn’t well enough to venture out, there are other things you can do at home.
Our nurse tells the story of her mother-in-law who suffered from dementia and often got agitated when she came to visit. They discovered that keeping a basket of unfolded laundry (socks, pillow cases, towels, etc.) on hand relaxed her. Folding laundry became her purpose.
Maybe gardening is a passion, but your mom is no longer well enough to spend hours kneeling in the backyard. You could recreate a “garden” in standing bins or pots. Or if your dad loved bowling or golf, you might check out the Wii versions of these games. Obviously the “purpose” depends on your loved one’s health, physical abilities, and interests, but there are a million ideas if you’re creative.
And, if like us, you start noticing a big change in your parent—an absence of something simple but consistent like crossword puzzles—it’s worth exploring. I never asked my father-in-law why he stopped his crosswords, but now I wonder what it would have revealed if I did.

453,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/living-with-alzheimers-and-dementia/,"November is National Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Month. If a family member has been diagnosed with dementia, it can come as a shock and create anxiety within the family as to what will happen next. For many adults and seniors diagnosed with this disease, they want to remain independent and in their own homes for as long as possible. To achieve this goal, there will need to be some changes to enable people with dementia to remain independent for longer or make it easier for others to give support.*
- Avoid falls: Falls are a common and potentially serious problem affecting older people. The risk of falls increases with age. This may be because of a range of factors: medical conditions (such as stroke), medication, balance difficulties, visual impairment, cognitive impairment, and environmental factors. Falls can have detrimental effects on people, including injuries, loss of confidence and reduced activity. For some people with dementia, the condition can also increase the likelihood of falling. They may be less likely to recover as successfully as someone who does not have dementia.
- Check the home for potential hazards such as rugs, loose carpets, furniture, or objects lying on the floor, and modify as appropriate.
- Improve Lighting: As people get older, they need more light to see clearly. This is because of age-related changes to the eyes. Dementia can cause damage to the visual system (the eyes and the parts of the nervous system that process visual information), and this can lead to difficulties. The type of difficulty will depend on the type of dementia.
- Increase light levels where possible. Leave key lights on at night, for example, in the bathroom. Add a nightlight in bedrooms and hallways.
- Make Changes to the Home: As people get older, they may experience difficulties in managing everyday activities such as cooking or bathing, for a variety of reasons. People with dementia may experience additional challenges as their dementia progresses, because of memory problems or a reduced ability to carry out tasks in the correct sequence.
- Label cupboards and objects with pictures and words so that they can be identified.
- Where possible, use devices that only have one function and are easy to identify, such as a tea kettle.
- Place clear instructions somewhere visible that can easily be followed.
- Make sure the kitchen is well lit.
- Fit an isolation valve to a gas cooker so that the cooker cannot be turned on and left on. Devices are also available for electric cookers.
- Look into products that may help maintain independence and safety such as electric kettles that switch off automatically.
- If the person’s ability to recognize danger is declining, consider removing potentially dangerous implements such as sharp knives, but place other items for everyday use within easy reach.
- Safety Outside: Being outdoors is important for people of all ages, and has many benefits. It is good for mental and physical health, including wellbeing, sleep, and appetite. Being outdoors can have psychological benefits such as reduced depression and agitation.
- Make sure the patio, porches, and entrances are well lit.
- Put a rail on any stairs to help the person get up and down them.
- Avoid trip hazards such as loose paving and uneven surfaces.
- Have seating areas so that the person can take a rest or enjoy being outside if they are unsteady on their feet.
- Arrange Access: Make plans for how someone can gain access if the person with dementia or their caregiver are unable to answer the door.
To keep your loved one in their home for as long as possible requires planning. As we age, it is inevitable that we will need to change the way we live. If you are living with someone with dementia, there can be higher risks because everyone will experience dementia in their own way. Do you have questions about how to keep your aging parents or loved ones in their home and not sure where to turn? Feel free to contact our Nurse Gina or a FirstLight Home Care location near you.

454,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/living-with-parkinsons-disease/,"Living with Parkinson’s disease can be challenging. But there are ways to help improve your quality of life.
At FirstLight® Home Care, we understand the impact Parkinson’s Disease has on patients and their loved ones. Tremors, stiffness, loss of balance, and depression can lead to isolation and poor quality of life. Discovering the right medications, complementary therapies and support are ways to stay independent and even enhance your quality of life.
April is Parkinson’s Awareness month. There are more than one million Americans living with Parkinson’s disease, and most are doing everything they can to proactively affect the course of their disease in order to live a full, happy and healthy life.
If you are living with Parkinson’s Disease, here are 5 fundamental things you can do to improve your quality of life:
Eat Right: The Parkinson’s Foundation recommends that patients maintain a healthy diet. Most people living with the disease should eat a variety of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, milk and dairy products, and protein-rich foods such as meat and beans. They also should consider including nuts, olive oil, fish, and eggs in their diet for their beneficial fats.
Be Active: Regular moderate exercise can improve emotional well-being. Include physical activity in your everyday routine to improve Parkinson’s Disease symptoms and mental health. Find something you love to do and stick with it, whether it’s walking, playing golf, bicycling or swimming.
Build Your Network: The support of family and friends are important to your health and well-being. It’s also important to develop a bigger aid network. As the disease progresses, transportation, meal preparation and other activities of daily living can become overwhelming for the patient and the family members who are caring for them.
Finding the right non-medical home care like FirstLight, with our professional caregivers who provide Personal Care and Companion Care services to help with day-to-day needs, allows those suffering from the disease to live more independently. Help with personal hygiene, medication reminders, light housekeeping, walking, and mobility can give family members peace of mind.
Rest: It is important to sleep at least 8 hours per night, and consider taking one to two naps during the day to stay refreshed. Consult your doctor if symptoms such as restless leg syndrome, rapid eye movement (REM)-behavior disorder, tremor or difficulty turning in bed at night interfere with your ability to sleep.
Manage Stress: Anxiety and depression are part of the Parkinson’s picture. Stress worsens the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Learning to manage your stress can help control your symptoms, and keeping a positive attitude can go a long way. Socialize with friends and family; engage in a hobby you enjoy; try yoga or meditation techniques; and stay active.

455,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/living_independent_after_65/,"The number of American seniors is expected to reach 70 million by the year 2030, according to the U.S. Census. AARP reports that as many as 90% of people over the age of 65 are focused on living independently and live in their home for as long as they can.
We get it. Living independently has its perks, including staying in the comfort of your home with all its amenities, maintaining your privacy, and continuing to do the things you love. There is no doubt the aging-in-place movement promotes senior self-reliance!
Advancements in technology, home modifications, and in-home senior assistance services have this growing segment of the American population proving that they can retain some level of independence.
Modern Technology
Technological advancements, especially related to senior devices and gadgets, are allowing elderly people to age at home. Tools, equipment, and Apps are being geared toward ensuring their safety as they continue to live on their own.
Personal medical alert systems allow seniors to summon help quickly should they fall or need medical attention.
Video monitoring allows family members to visually monitor their aging loved in real time. This trend has been gaining popularity over the last few years as families spread out geographically.
Other systems are changing how older people age at home, including digital pill dispensers; voice-activated talking clocks that remind seniors to eat, take a short walk or even feed the cat; and GPS devices that call for the help of a response team and alert the family to the potential health or safety issue.
FirstLight Home Care has joined forces with TruSense, a smart home monitoring solution that uses sensor and GPS technology to provide insights into the health and well-being of a loved one. We think these are valuable advancements that not only help keep seniors safe but also give peace of mind to families.
Home Modifications
The desire to age in place may not work if the home an aging loved one is living in cannot accommodate the changes that come with growing old. However, sometimes minor adjustments can enable them to live safely in their homes.
This could include making simple changes around the home, such as:
- Adding wayfinding lights throughout the house to prevent accidents
- Moving furniture around to accommodate a wheelchair, cane or walker
- Adding handrails to assist them in and out of the shower
Sometimes major renovations must occur to allow a senior to remain in their home longer and safer, including:
- Updating outdoor lighting, walkways, and stairs to simplify access
- Adding a walk-in shower to help prevent stepping over the side of the bathtub every time they bathe
- Reconfiguring cabinet shelves to make things easier to reach
- Outfitting appliances with larger numbers and letters for easier visibility
Non-Medical Assistance
An elderly loved one may be more than capable of living independently, but they may need support with some activities that happen in their daily lives. FirstLight Home Care and our team of exceptional caregivers can provide quality, professional and dependable services to help seniors age at home. Our Companion Care and Personal Care services are customized based on need, which may include:
- Personal care: Bathing, eating, dressing, toileting, grooming
- Household care: Cleaning, laundry, organization, errands
- Meal preparation: Grocery shopping, meal planning, and prep
- Emotional care: Companionship, meaningful activities, conversation
For many aging family members, having someone to help them with weekly tasks and activities can mean the difference between living on their own and having to move into an assisted living community.

456,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/looking-for-a-caregiver-job-does-company-culture-matter/,"There’s a shortage of healthcare workers in this country across many areas, including in the home care field. That means if you’re looking for a caregiver job, your skills are definitely in demand.
However, not all home care companies are created equal. When you’re looking for a job as a caregiver, it’s important to not only assess the duties and responsibilities you’ll be handling, but also the culture of the company.
What is Culture & Why is It Important?
Culture is akin to a home care company’s unique personality. It includes factors like mission, vision and values. It also includes the beliefs and behaviors that determine how a team, including both leaders and employees, interact with each other.
When you work for a home care company with a strong culture that aligns with your own beliefs and attitudes, you’ll feel more comfortable on the job and loyal to your employer. During your tenure, you’ll also be happier and more satisfied, which will improve your quality of life overall.
Cultural Attributes to Look for in a Caregiver Job
Given the impact it will have on your level of satisfaction, culture is important to assess when you’re looking for a caregiver job. But what specific areas should you search for when it comes to evaluating an employer and a potential job opportunity? Here are a few:
Reputation: When you’re seeking a caregiver job, do your homework and research each company before you apply. You want to work for a reputable, credible home care company. If you have friends who work in caregiver jobs, you can ask them for referrals and which companies are known as good employers in the industry. Reputation matters and you’ll be happier at a company that has a solid one.
Work Environment: It can be difficult to find out about the work environment from a job description. However, if you’re called for an interview, make sure you ask questions about the environment and what it’s like to be part of the team. Ask the person interviewing you what they like most about working for the company. Also inquire about areas like continuing education and training. These are good indicators that an employer values and invests in their caregivers.
Scheduling: You want to work for an employer who is flexible with their hours and schedule. This is particularly important when you have your own family and personal obligations to attend to. When searching for caregiver jobs, look for employers who are accommodating when it comes to scheduling flexibility.

457,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/looking-for-caregiver-jobs-traits-of-great-caregivers/,"Are you nurturing and hard-working with a generous heart for others? You might have what it takes to be successful in a caregiver job.
As a caregiver, you’ll be helping many different people. For instance, seniors who want to age in place often have caregivers come into their homes to assist with daily tasks. Other individuals who often need the help of a caregiver include those with disabilities, dementia, chronic illnesses or who are recovering after surgery.
6 Traits of Great Caregivers
If you’re a natural caregiver at heart and want to turn it into a career opportunity, what traits are important to have? Here’s a look at a six:
1. Compassion
Having compassion is critical for success in caregiver jobs. You’re going to be helping individuals navigate through many ups and downs. At the same time, their families will also be turning to you for support and guidance. Treating them with compassion and respect is a must, always keeping in mind that your job as a caregiver is to make their lives easier while providing peace of mind.
2. Patience and Composure
When you’re caring for someone who is elderly or disabled, you’re often tasked with helping them through many personal tasks, like bathing, grooming, dressing or even going to the bathroom.
It’s your job as a caregiver to maintain your composure and treat each individual with dignity, respect and patience. There will be times when you get frustrated, especially after a long day on your feet. However, it’s important to stay calm and carry on.
3. Creativity and Problem Solving
As with any job, certain caregiving tasks are more difficult than others. That’s where creativity and problem-solving skills come in. For instance, if the individual you’re caring for doesn’t want to get out of bed, you might turn on some upbeat music to motivate them. If they’re having a hard time remembering things, you may encourage them with memory exercises, such as playing a card game, playing Sudoku or doing a crossword puzzle together.
The key as a caregiver is to approach each day with optimism and a desire to find creative solutions for any roadblock that appears.
4. Flexibility
Even when you have the day planned out, you need to maintain a flexible attitude when it comes to your job as a caregiver. For instance, if your client is having a bad day, physically or mentally, it can derail your plans. In these instances, it’s important to adapt quickly to the changing situation and ensure you’re meeting your client’s needs in the moment.
In addition, it is essential to adapt your personality to the particular client you’re taking care of. For instance, if you tend to be outgoing and extroverted and your client prefers quiet and calm, you may need to be more reserved so that they feel comfortable.
5. Dependability
Clients and families alike are depending on you for a consistent and reliable level of care. It’s critical to arrive on time and adhere to each individual’s personalized care plan. Over time, this will show both your client and their family that you are trustworthy and dependable, which is essential to forming a strong bond with both.
6. A Good Attitude
There are times when the job of caregiving can be sad or stressful. This includes when a client is severely ill or nearing the end of life. However, you must maintain a positive attitude throughout and understand the importance of the care you are delivering. You are making their journey easier, as well as their family’s, serving as an invaluable source of help and support along the way.
We Offer Access to Rewarding Caregiver Jobs

458,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/losing-it-early-signs-of-dementia/,"According to the Alzheimer’s Association, more than 5 million Americans live daily with dementia. In fact, every 67 seconds, someone in the United States develops dementia.
Dementia is a collection of symptoms that can be caused by various diseases. The leading cause of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease. Dementia can also be caused by brain damage incurred from any injury or stroke or from other diseases like Huntington’s or Lewy body dementia. Many people write in to Nurse Gina to ask about dementia and its early signs versus normal age-appropriate forgetfulness. Here are some signs to consider:
- Memory Loss: If you or a loved one is experience some memory problems, you might think dementia. Actually, you need to have at least two types of impairment that are significant enough to interfere with everyday life to be considered for a dementia diagnosis – including experiencing impairments in language, communication, focus or reasoning.
- Short-Term Memory Loss: A subtle change in how you or your elderly relative remember short-term activities could be an early sign. An example would be that they can remember years past, but not what they had for breakfast.
- Difficulty Communicating: Struggling to communicate thoughts the way they want or can’t seem to explain things could be an early symptom. It takes them a while to form what they want to say and conclude their thoughts.
- Mood Swings: We all get moody. However, mood changes such as depression or a shift in personality – from shy to outgoing – could be early signs.
- Apathy: Listlessness or apathy is a common symptom of dementia. Losing interest in hobbies or activities or not wanting to spend time with family or friends could be an early sign.
- Unable to Complete Normal Tasks: If you or a loved one have difficulties doing normal tasks – such as putting away dishes and folding clothing — to more complex tasks such as balancing your checkbook or playing games early onset dementia could be upon you.
As we grow older, we all have changes in how we function and our abilities. For instance, it is a natural part of aging to slow down. Even simple tasks that we did in our 40’s, 50’s, and 60’s can become more challenging.
If you have any questions whether your symptoms are a normal part of dementia or could signal dementia, make an appointment with your doctor. There is no single test that will reveal if you have dementia; rather, it’s a compilation of taking a medical history, conducting a neurological exam and running some mental status tests.
If your loved one is diagnosed with dementia and needs care, FirstLight Home Care can help. Our caregivers can tend to daily needs in addition to keeping the brain active. To read more about how we handle dementia, download our brochure."
459,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/love-heart-helping-prevent-heart-disease-healthy-diet/,"Taking care of your heart is integral to healthy aging. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 27.6 million Americans – about 11.5 percent of the population – have diagnosed heart disease. The good news is heart disease can often be prevented – and even reversed – when people make healthy choices. That includes adoption of a healthy diet. February is American Heart Month, and it’s a good time to take a look at lifestyle changes we all can make to help fight cardiovascular disease.
Eating right and staying fit are important no matter what your age. Whether you’re 22 or 82, you can take proactive steps to lower your risk for heart disease, including:
- Following a healthy eating plan
- Maintaining a healthy weight
- Including regular physical activity in your routine
- Quitting smoking
- Managing stress
The National Institute on Aging explains that many of the problems older adults experience with their heart and blood vessels are not caused by aging, but are actually caused by preventable disease. And if you have risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes or obesity, your chances of developing heart disease increase significantly.
Adopt a heart-healthy diet
A healthy lifestyle is the best defense against heart disease, and a great place to start is by adopting a heart-healthy diet. Just because a diet is described as “healthy” doesn’t mean it has to be lacking in flavor or satisfaction. Heart-healthy eating can be equally as delicious as it is good for your body. You can boost flavor and cut calories with a few simple kitchen tips:
- Eat a rainbow. Choose vibrant, eye-appealing ingredients, including fresh fruits and vegetables in an array of colors. Generally speaking, the more color, the more vitamins and antioxidants.
- Choose lean cuts of meat. Cut away excess fat from beef and pork, and remove the skin from poultry before cooking.
- Fold in flavor. Aromatics such as garlic and onion add flavor depth to any dish. Also try adding herbs, spices and lemon juice to season food instead of salt, butter or margarine.
- Use a low-fat cooking method. Choose steaming, broiling, poaching or grilling over frying. Or try a stir fry with just a little added oil or broth.
Create a recipe for a healthy heart
There are plenty of creative ways to make a tasty, heart-healthy dish. The FirstLight team has assembled a collection of some of our favorites that can benefit your heart and overall health.
According to Amanda, the two recipes she recommends are inspired by many FirstLight clients who prefer soft foods like mashed potatoes or soup. She also used to serve these dishes to her children when they were young.
Ingredients:
- 1 sweet potato (3 oz.)
- Ground pork
- 1/3 onion
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 TBSP margarine
- 2 TBSP olive oil
- 1/2 tsp white cooking wine
- 1 TBSP soy sauce
- 1 tsp stevia or honey
- 4 TBSP water
- 1/2 tsp cornstarch
Optional: Cherry tomatoes to garnish; side of steamed or boiled fresh green beans
To make:
Peel potato, slice and steam or boil. Once cooked, mash and stir in salt and margarine to taste. Mix well. Peel and rinse the onion and chop. Heat olive oil in pan and stir fry onion for a few seconds until fragrant. Stir in ground pork and add white cooking wine, soy sauce, stevia/honey, water and cornstarch. Stir fry evenly and quickly. If serving green beans on the side, cook them in water or steam until well done.
Put the potatoes on a plate and drizzle the pork mixture on top. Garnish with cherry tomatoes and serve with a side of green beans.
Chicken/Beef Vegetable Soup
Recommended by Amanda Chow, Owner, FirstLight Home Care of East Brunswick
Ingredients:
- 2/3 lbs. of tender beef
- 1/2 carrot
- 1 potato
- 4 leaves cabbage
- 1 TBSP white cooking wine
- 1 tsp salt
- 10 C boiling water
- Few drops of cornstarch solution
To make:
Cut meat into small pieces and blanch to clean. Rinse and cook in the boiling water and cooking wine for 40 minutes. Peel carrot and potato and dice. Add to soup, cooking until well done or tender. Rinse and chop the cabbage. Add to the soup mixture and cook until cabbage is soft. Add salt to taste and cornstarch solution to thicken.
Baked Pita with Cheese, Tomatoes and Cucumbers
Recommended by Rebecca Rushing, FirstLight Director of Client Care Services
Ingredients:
- 4 6-inch whole-wheat round pita breads
- 4 oz. fat-free shredded cheese (about 1 C)
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1/2 tsp dried basil
- 2 medium tomatoes, sliced into quarter-inch rounds
- 1 large cucumber, cut into quarter-inch pieces
- 1 green onion, chopped
Optional: Sprouts, chopped lettuce or any other favorite veggies
To make:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cut the pita breads in half and set aside. Shred the cheese and mix well with the garlic. Sprinkle the dried basil over the shredded cheese. Divide cheese evenly between the 8 pita halves, about 2 TBSP per pita bread. Place pita breads with cheese on a flat pan, cookie sheet or aluminum foil and bake for 5 minutes, until cheese melts. Carefully remove from heat. Put onto plates and serve with tomatoes, cucumbers and green onions.
Pro tip: You may wish to make these in batches to keep the cheese melted and prevent the bread from getting hard.
According to Rebecca, this is her favorite recipe!

FirstLight Home Care and Ageless Grace partner on brain fitness program
It’s never too early to start doing whatever it takes to keep your brain young, healthy and active. Sustaining healthy brain function and keeping the mind sharp at any age may be more important than you think.
“There have been several studies on the impact of how maintaining a healthy brain can help prevent early dementia and even diseases such as diabetes,” stated Jeff Bevis, CEO and Co-Founder of FirstLight Home Care.
FirstLight is thrilled to announce that it is expanding its services to include Ageless Grace, an innovative program that can help individuals maintain a healthy brain. We have already begun offering Ageless Grace training to our franchise owners and managers so that they may, in turn, train our caregivers. The customized curriculum was developed by Denise Medved, founder and creator of Ageless Grace, specifically for FirstLight Home Care.
Innovative Brain Fitness Program
Bevis says the company plans to continue educating FirstLight franchise owners across the country with the goal of offering the Ageless Grace program to FirstLight clients in up to 100 markets by mid-2019.
“We love the program’s anti-aging focus that helps improve overall health and well-being, reduce stress, keep the brain agile and the body responsive. It’s all about improving the quality of life for our clients, especially those with cognitive deficits.”
Ageless Grace is a cutting-edge brain fitness program that is meant to exercise the body and stimulate the brain. The exercises, based on neuroplasticity, activate all five functions of the brain – analytical, strategic, kinesthetic learning, memory/recall, creativity and imagination. The Ageless Grace program consists of 21 simple exercises focused on natural, everyday movements and is designed for all ages and abilities.
Exercises Based on Neuroplasticity
Medved created Ageless Grace based on her own experience with her parents’ health and observing the different ways they were aging. She wondered if there was a way to keep both the body and the brain healthy as we age. Medved spent seven years with a Duke University-affiliated hospital and a university graduate department to develop this creative approach to aging.
“Brain health is the ability to remember, learn, play and maintain an active mind,” said Medved. “It’s all about capitalizing on the strengths of your brain and helping to reduce some of the risks to it as you age. The Ageless Grace exercises, which are based on neuroplasticity, address all 21 physical skills needed for lifelong optimal brain function, and each of the tools emphasizes different anti-aging techniques.”"
461,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/make-a-difference-in-the-life-of-a-senior/,"October is the month that has the largest community support day called Make a Difference. Millions of people gather around the country to improve the lives of others. In its 24th year, this day is all about helping those less fortunate or people who just need a helping hand.
Seniors often need help more than one day a year – it is often a life-long issue as they get older and less mobile.
Many senior citizens need help because as they age, doing household chores or running errands can become more difficult. If you have a senior relative, neighbor or friend, here are some ways you can help make their life a little easier.
- Paint. Maybe their house could use a facelift. Volunteer to paint the exterior of their home or even a room. Painting one room can brighten up their whole outlook!
- Wash windows. Washing windows can be hard, especially if it involves ladders. Wash their windows inside and out and take off the screens and clean them.
- Many times seniors are lonely, isolated from their friends or family. Put aside some time to just listen to their stories, lessons learned and experience. Find out what they are passionate about and chances are, they would love to share some anecdotes with you.
- Fall proof their home. About 1/3 of the elder population over the age of 65 falls every year. At 80 years, over half of seniors fall annually. You can make a big difference by fall-proofing their home. Remove any loose throw rugs. Change all the lightbulbs so they can see better. Make sure all railings are secure and any clutter is removed.
- Clean their home. It can be hard for seniors to dust and vacuum their home, especially getting into small spaces. Volunteer to do a thorough cleaning.
- It can be hard to cook for just one or two people, yet seniors need to be concerned about their nutrition. Cook a home-cooked meal and share it with them. In fact, cook a week’s worth of meals so they can freeze them. Too many seniors subsist on TV dinners and take-out food.
- Run errands. Offer to run errands for seniors who have difficulty driving or can’t drive at all. If possible, do this weekly, and let them know you are available if they need you. You can also bring them along as you ride around town, so they can get out of the house and visit with you at the same time.
At FirstLight Home Care, we make a difference in the lives of seniors every day through compassionate in-home care. Our mission is to help seniors stay independent and safe in their homes for as long as possible.
Make a difference in the life of a senior all year long."
462,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/make-every-day-a-fabulous-fathers-day/,"Father’s Day 2014 may be over but can’t we keep it alive each and every day. While searching the web for smart men talking about being a great day, we found Carey Casey, CEO of the National Center for Fathering. We’re now big fans.
Mr. Casey wrote the following blog earlier this month and we thought it was worthy to share because he was spot on. The National Center for Fathering has a father-training program that looks very rewarding and his ideas for how to make every day like Father’s Day. His tips are simple and easy for all of us to apply.
- He said that every day can be like Father’s Day: No he’s not suggesting asking for gifts and special treatment every day but instead, he wants to challenge dads to take whatever positive thoughts and motivations come to you on Father’s Day, and renew them every day.
- One of our favorite tips was that Mr. Casey said: “It is the awesome privilege to be a dad and granddad and that you should try to soak up every minute that you get to spend with your kids and grandkids.” We agree. In our line of work for caring for the elderly and those in need, we find some of the most life-changing times for us is when we watch our clients engage and interact with their family members. We can see how much it means to everyone involved and how we need to do this every day and every time we be with family.
- The reality check message in Mr. Casey’s blog entry had to do with the challenging and hard times of being a father. When asked are there challenges and hard times when being a father? “Of course. But you should really try to turn the atmosphere positive with family and be a force for good things in their lives.” We agree.
We love the ideas behind having the essence of Father’s Day be pulled in to every day of the year and we hope all dads (and moms…hello, Mother’s Day was just last month) take on this challenge to make this simple, but life-changing commitment, to do your best for your children every day. To learn more about the National Center for Fathering we encourage you to check out their website.

463,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/making-a-list-and-checking-it-twice/,"Now is a good time to sit down with your elder and figure out his or her priorities for the holiday season. Spend some time together making a list and setting dates to get it all done. From parties to presents, the holidays can be stressful—but with the right planning and preparation, it can also be a pleasant time filled with family bonding and fun.
1. Décor Galore. Putting up a tree and sprinkling holiday decorations around the house can create a cheerful environment filled with past holiday memories. This is also a great bonding experience for you and your elder—even better, get your children involved. Make a day out of it: Put on some holiday tunes, light a pinecone-scented candle and whip up a batch of gingerbread cookies.
2. Hitting the mall. You will definitely want to help your elder with shopping—this can be an overwhelming task that requires thoughtful work. Most stores are open additional hours leading up to Christmas, but online shopping is another alternative. It’s a good idea to buy a few extra gifts for anyone you’ve forgotten; CLICK HERE for some gift ideas. Oh, and don’t forget to help your loved one pick out a holiday outfit!
3. Giving back. Participating in a few charity events this month will give your elder a breath of fresh air while also giving back to his or her local community. You never know, you may even make some new friends in the process. Ideas include donating gifts to a local hospital or spending time at a food bank. HERE is a great list of some ideas in the Virginia area. Many of these should be available in your hometown as well.
4. Last-minute delivery. Do you have family members living across the country? Make sure you help your elder finish his or her shopping in time to mail out the gifts. Usually the Monday of the week before Christmas marks the busiest of the year (this year, it falls on Dec. 13), so if you’re looking to beat those crowds you’ll want to hit your local post office before then.
The holidays don’t have to be hectic. Make a list—and stick to it! With extra time off work and school (hopefully), you should be able to get everything done in time for the holidays! 🙂
Do you have an idea or tip that we didn’t include on this list? We want to hear from you. Send your stories to Kristen@sandersonpr.com."
464,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/making-the-choice-in-home-care-or-nursing-home/,"If you have an aging parent, the term “age in place” is a topic that comes up in many conversations about their future. While most seniors want to remain in their home for as long as possible, life occurrences may not allow. And if they have reached a point when they cannot physically care for themselves, one of the options that must be considered is moving your loved one to a nursing home.
Making the decision to have your aging parents remain in their home or to move them into a nursing home is a difficult choice. In-home care offers companion and personal care service to help seniors maintain their freedom and independence. Nursing homes offer a high level of medical care with experienced physicians and nurses on staff. However, a nursing home can come with resistance from the senior because they believe they may lose their freedom and independence, and they fear the expense of such care could be outside their budget.
In-Home Care is preferred in many family situations. However, the need for nursing home care becomes the obvious choice when your loved one requires more than basic daily care such as dressing and bathing. If they have physical and/or mental conditions that require more specific or skilled care and attention because of rehabilitation, medical, or specialized supervision needs, they may need a nursing home.
WHEN IN-HOME CARE IS THE BEST CHOICE
- In-home care allows your loved one, who is still self-sufficient, to live safely in their own home. Home care can assist seniors, those recovering from a medical illness or surgery, or adults with special needs or a disability who need some assistance to live independently.
- In-home care is ideal when your loved one needs non-medical support and services.
- Home care providers can adjust their non-medical services based on your loved one needs. Care can be day-to-day, overnight, or scheduled care throughout the week depending upon needs.
- If your loved one just needs support around the home, services can include help with light household chores, such as laundry, vacuuming, and other chores to help maintain and safe and healthy living environment.
- If your loved one wants to live at home but needs to reduce the amount of driving they do, a caregiver can provide transportation to run errands, doctor appointments, or social events with friends in the community.
- If your loved one seeks one-to-one care and individualized attention, an in-home caregiver provides that service.
- Caregivers can be another set of eyes ensuring that your loved one is taking the right medications when required, is eating properly, dressing, bathing, and is able to function in and around their home.
- In-home care is customized based on a family’s needs and can be adjusted as your loved one ages.
- Home care provides peace of mind to family members who do not live close by. They can feel confident that their active senior who lives independently is receiving both the personal and companion care they need.
WHEN A NURSING HOME IS THE BEST CHOICE
As difficult as it is to suggest that your parent moves out of his or her own home, a nursing home might be the best choice. It might be time to consider this option when:
- Your loved one needs constant or almost constant care every day.
- Your parent needs skilled nursing care, orthopedic care, physical, occupational and speech therapy, and/or wound care.
- They can only walk with assistance or continual supervision.
- Continence and toileting care are needed daily.
- Living at home alone becomes dangerous due to difficulty seeing or hearing, making navigating the home on their own a challenge.
- Your parent has difficulty making daily decisions or is experiencing memory and recognition issues.
- Problematic behaviors become more frequent, such as a verbal and physical abuse, acting inappropriately in public, resisting necessary care and wandering.
The choice between in-home care or a nursing home is a tough and emotional family decision. While most adult children want to have their parents live at home, the care their parents need may be too overwhelming and may require skilled services that go beyond their fundamental capabilities. A nursing home might be the best option and best place for a loved one to live out their remaining years.

465,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/may-is-older-americans-month/,"Encouraging Older Americans to “Engage at Every Age”
Each May, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Community Living leads our nation’s observance of Older Americans Month. It is a time to recognize the contributions of older Americans and think about how we can work together to support and value people over age 65.
The 2018 Older Americans Month theme is “Engage at Every Age”. It’s meant to remind us that you are never too old (or young) to take part in activities that can enrich your physical, mental, and emotional well-being. It also celebrates the ways in which older adults positively impact our communities.
In commemoration of Older Americans Month, we’ve put together a list of activities you and your local community can do this month, as well as throughout the year, to thank older adults and help engage our aging loved ones.
- Start a mentoring program where seniors help children succeed in school.
- Encourage local community or fitness centers to offer nutrition classes to educate on healthy eating for seniors.
- Work with your local town hall to host a meeting to discuss and find out what community services seniors want, as well as ways to involve the community in helping make new programs a reality.
- Encourage your senior residents to share their life stories with others by participating in story circles. Host weekly story circles focused on a specific topic and allow everyone to discuss. The stories they share would be interesting for people of all ages. This can be done at area seniors centers or local churches.
- Help an older person gather family photos and make an album or scrapbook about their life and the legacy they will leave. Get their children and grandchildren involved as well.
- Encourage your local community center or library to host a game day that will stimulate our brains and keep them sharp.
- Bring together senior groups to prepare meals and provide for those less fortunate in the area, or consider volunteering at a local food bank.
- Teachers and other school administration can help local students set up interviews with residents of a retirement community, assisted living community or nursing home, and write short biographies for a school assignment. Then plan a program in which the students read aloud their stories. Invite families of students and seniors from the communities to attend.
At FirstLight® Home Care, we believe in supporting our elderly community members by providing home care and senior care services that promote mental and physical wellness for our elderly loved ones and their families.

466,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/meal-tips-for-aging-parents/,"Do you have an elderly family member living alone? Do they struggle with cooking and are not sure about the meal plans for them? You can help them by preparing meals and putting them in their freezer and help them plan their meals with easy meal techniques. Following are some of our favorite ideas for planning ahead and simplifying meals.
1. Crock Pot Meals: Prepare meals that are put together, seasoned, and ready to stick in the crock pot to cook. You can prepare these meals in advance by placing them in containers and freezing them. Then all they need to do is put them in the crock pot.
2. Prepared Food Items: Grocery stores, Costco and Sam’s Club have wonderful prepared food items that are ready to go. Pick up a few of them to eat now and freeze for future dinners.
3. Soups: Prepare your favorite soup recipe, and then freeze it. Do not use pasta or potatoes in your soups (they continue to absorb the liquid in the soup).
4. We Love Chicken: Cook large quantities of chicken in a stock pot. Freeze and pull out for meals later. Chicken is s great protein to add to salads, wraps, tacos, pasta, rice and more.
5. Double or Triple Batch: When cooking your weekend meals, make more and share. Split the meals with family. Eat some now and freeze later.
6. Stock Up: When you or another family member goes to the grocery store, pick up items for the folks to keep the basics in their pantry. Pasta, pasta sauce, boxed meals, bread mixes, canned food, soup, cereal and protein shakes/bars are great to have on hand.
7. Marinate Meats: We found this idea online. Simply put raw meat in a freezer zip-loc bag, with a marinade that you like, and then freeze. Do several bags at once. Later, you can pull out one bag and stick the meal in a crock pot to cook.
8. Grocery Store Delivery: If you do not live near your folks, find out if their local grocery store delivers. You can place an order for your folks on line and have them deliver it to them for a very small fee.
9. Meals On Wheels: If your folks qualify for Meals on Wheels to be delivered to their home, you may want to check this out. Not only will they receive a meal, they will also connect to an amazing volunteer delivering the food. To find out more about Meals on Wheels America, click here."
467,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/meditation-and-aging/,"For thousands of years, meditation has served as an excellent source of stress relief and relaxation. Through active practice, people can even see improvements in their health, including reduced blood pressure, a slower heart rate, and a stronger immune system. But did you know that it might also help reduce the process of aging?
Recent studies have found that people who practice mindful meditation (focusing on the present) had improved telomere health. For those who aren’t neuroscientists, telomeres are the protective ends of our DNA that prevent the ends of chromosomes from fusing with nearby chromosomes or deteriorating. The healthier the telomere, the greater its ability to fight off this deterioration, which is the cause of aging. Through the process of active, mindful mediation, the body is able to strengthen its telomeres leading to a reduced aging process.
According to NaturalNews.com, the study, which was conducted by the University of California at San Francisco, studied 239 healthy women between the ages of 50 and 65 to see how the body reacts to thinking in the present versus letting their mind wander. The study revealed that the women who let their mind wander had shorter telomeres. Although the study is not conclusive, it does arise a new theory on how mindful meditation can help strengthen the body’s telomeres, ultimately leading to a decreased aging process.
So how can you reap the anti-aging benefits of mediation? First, you must find yourself in a quiet room free of distractions. Close your eyes, breath slowly, and try to focus on nothing but the moment you are currently in. The anti-aging benefits of mediation come through the process of removing all thought from your mind that does not reflect the present. If you find outside thoughts enter your mind, don’t fight them, as this will only make them grow stronger. Instead, accept them for a moment, then let them go. Once you have more practice with meditation, these thoughts will enter your mind less frequently. Meditate whenever you can find free time and need to relieve the stress in your life, and you may also see the benefits of a reduced aging process."

469,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/men-are-caregivers-too/,"A couple of weeks ago I wrote about a long-time friend of mine who had been caring for his elderly mother. My blog entry was also about how FirstLight Home Care is meeting the needs of aging America, and an unfortunate lack of awareness surrounding caregiving options.
This week however, I want to circle back to the fact that my friend Dave* (a male obviously) was in a caregiver role for his mom. Dave* is not alone in having that title. According to a National Family Caregivers Association (NFCA) survey, 44% of caregivers are men. Yes, I said 44%, and yes I said men. Are you surprised by that statistic? I will admit that I was slightly surprised to find out that almost half of all caregivers in the United States are men. Yet at the same time, I had a sense of great pride (for my own gender).
In past generations, the role of caregiver so often fell to women that many people just assume that it’s a gender specific job. Take a look at the nursing industry for instance. It’s only been in recent decades that the idea of a male nurse has become much more common place. And, you will find more and more men filling the role of “stay-at-home-dad.” I love to hear about old ways of thinking being thrown by the wayside.
There are many situations that require men to be caregivers as well. It’s not always an elderly parent that necessitates men to step up. We are hearing about and seeing more cases of spousal care due to Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease and multiple sclerosis just to name a few debilitating diseases. Just today I read an article in USA Today that stated male caregivers for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients has risen from 19% – 40% in the last 15 years. This is a huge increase, and once again, it makes me proud to know that my fellow males are bucking any stereotype that is left for the caregiving role.
I also recently read an article that touched on the fact that many times people don’t really see the person who is pushing the wheelchair. Who are these kind hearts that balance checkbooks, clean homes, bathe, dress and dispense medicine for and to those in need? These kind-hearted people are just that…people too. People that I’ve come to find out include 44% of men. So the next time you see a male caregiver, maybe give him a kind word or two. But regardless of gender, caregiving is a huge responsibility and commitment. My hat goes off to all 42 million of you across the country who care for loved ones!

470,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/missing-the-crazy-christmas-lady/,"The other day my daughter asked me to watch “The Grinch That Stole Christmas” with Jim Carrey. It was the first snow of the year, and it seemed like a fun thing to do, even though it was way ahead of the holidays. It’s a fun movie with a heartfelt message. When the movie ended, I started to cry. Not little sniffles, but heaving sobs. When my daughter asked me why, I explained that it was the first holiday season without my Mom.
These “milestone” moments are always hard, particularly the first year. We liked to make fun of her (as all kid’s do) for being the “crazy Christmas lady”. If you even thought about shopping on Black Friday, you would be exiled from the family. After all, that was the day to put up Christmas decorations!
Every inch of our home was decorated with garland, mistletoe and holly, right down to the Christmas toilet paper (it was scratchy – give me Charmin any day). It’s funny that I don’t remember the presents as much as the festivities. Think about it … people cherish the memories … the gifts are short lived.
When we eventually moved my Mom to a skilled care facility, I still flew in and decorated her room. I wrapped her door like a giant present, complete with gift wrapping and a bow. And then because the other patients were so jealous, I had to do everyone’s room up and down the hallway! Be careful of those good deeds!
There are things I will miss terribly … the homemade chocolate chip Christmas cookies that were so thin, you had to place the chips one-by-one. Singing carols that would make Blake Shelton from The Voice vote us out in the first round. Then there are a few things I will miss not so much: the annual Christmas picture where the kids had to dress up in uncomfortable matching clothes and inevitably got the “evil eye” for complaining.
No matter how busy we were, no matter what age, we went on an annual pilgrimage to a woman’s shelter, dropping off food, gifts and presents. I always felt a little guilty that I didn’t appreciate what I had more. And that I imagine was the purpose – not to forget the true meaning of Christmas – it’s not about what you get, but what you give.
People cope with death in different ways. So as the holidays approach, here’s some suggestions I have received that may help you as well:
- Do something different for the holidays. Vary the menu, try some new recipes, go on a trip, or just change the locale.
- Keep certain traditions alive so that your own family and friends will carry them on. My Mom started my daughter an ornament collection when she was born. Now that she’s 21, we almost have a whole tree full! But never and I mean never stop making the homemade cranberry sauce that Mom made every year and became one of the family favorites.
- Adopt a Grand Mom and invite her over for the holidays. They have an Adopt-a-Pet program, but no Adopt a Mom program, so I decided months ago to start my own. I went to our local nursing home and asked them to “adopt” an elderly woman who had no family and friends. “Ellie” has become a part of our lives – we go shopping every Wednesday and we alternate cooking family dinners twice/month. Since she’s Italian, I have learned to cook awesome pizza and lasagna something my Polish Mama never taught me!
And as I go to hang the Christmas stocking this year, there will be one for my Mom. Only it will be filled with gift cards for the people at the women’s shelter … a tradition that will hopefully be passed on through the generations!
The other day my daughter turned to me and said: “you’re becoming the crazy Christmas lady just like Nana.” That was the greatest compliment she could have given me.
The Crazy Christmas Lady lives on!"
471,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/mobility-aids-make-aging-in-place-possible/,"When you have a loved one with mobility issues, it’s scary to leave them alone. It can seem like there are fall hazards everywhere, from the staircase and area rugs to the bathroom and bedroom. You might want them to move to an assisted living community where they can get more help. Yet, they want to remain in their home. How can you keep them safe while they’re aging in place? Here are some aids that can help both of you gain peace of mind.
Walkers & Canes
According to the National Council on Aging, an older adult dies from a fall every 19 minutes in the U.S. The good news is that a simple step, like having a cane or walker on hand, can protect your loved one from a potential injury, while giving them the independence they crave.
Both aids are the most accessible on the market today. In fact, many neighborhood drugstores sell canes. These simple tools can make a world of difference for your loved one, enabling them to walk from one place to another with more ease and comfort.
Over time, they can also help educe balance issues and lower body pain, while improving posture. Just make sure whatever cane or walker your loved one is using is set at the proper height for them for their safety and comfort.
Adjustable Beds
Adjustable beds offer another way to help your loved one when they’re aging in place. Gone are the days of traditional hospital beds. Today, there are a range of more luxurious styles and designs that can help your loved one with chronic pain, so they enjoy a more restful night’s sleep.
Most importantly, though, getting into and out of bed will be much easier with an adjustable bed. You can also add rails to the sides if you’re concerned about your loved one falling out of bed at night. In addition, an adjustable bed will make reading and watching TV more comfortable.
Motorized Stairlifts
Going up and down stairs is one the biggest hazards for seniors when aging in place. One tiny misstep can lead to a big fall and a broken bone or worse.
A stairlift can be helpful, giving your loved one the ability to navigate the staircase when they’re alone. These lifts are attached to a motorized rail that takes an individual up the staircase when they’re seated in it. They just have to be able to sit down and get up from the lift.
These can be installed on both straight and curved staircases. With today’s many options, they can even be personalized to match the style and decor of your loved one’s home, so it’s more inviting and less clinical.
Power Wheelchairs & Scooters
If your loved one has issues with mobility that are severe, including any paralysis or lower body weakness, a motorized wheelchair can help them get around. These are easier to maneuver around the home and far lighter when compared to a conventional wheelchair.
If your loved one doesn’t need a wheelchair on a regular basis, a scooter might be a better choice for helping with aging in place. These too offer greater mobility but are more heavy-duty and can be used outdoors when going for a stroll or to get around a store with more ease.
Additional Tips for Helping Your Loved One Age in Place
Before you invest in any of these mobility aids, check with your loved one’s doctor to ensure you’re making the right selections and purchasing the aids that will be most helpful. Also, call their insurance provider to find out what’s covered under their plan, so you pay less out-of-pocket for it. Oftentimes, Medicare Part B and Medicaid will cover the cost of mobility devices that are prescribed by a physician.
If your loved one is having a hard time accepting using a mobility aid, be compassionate and try to listen first. Allow them to discuss their fears and why they’re hesitant. Realize that it’s also hard for them to accept that they’re aging and require extra help. In addition, they may be fearful of continuing to lose their independence, so it’s important to be tactful and gentle.
How Home Care Can Help Your Loved One Who’s Aging in Place
Aging in place is easier and safer with the help of professionals. Consider hiring a caregiver who can assist your loved one in many ways. They can provide non-medical support, including help with mobility around the home. They can also offer transportation to and from appointments and to run errands.
Beyond providing physical assistance that helps with aging in place, a professional caregiver can offer companionship and conversation. This can be crucial if your loved one lives alone and is feeling isolated and depressed.
However, by delivering emotional and social support, combined with physical assistance, a professional caregiver can open the world back up to your loved one. They’ll be safer and happy, aging in place with as much independence as possible.

472,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/moments-of-thanksgiving/,"It’s difficult to capture in one blog post all the things we’re thankful for at FirstLight Home Care. For us, it’s about the clients who trust us to help them achieve independence and live happier lives. The family caregivers who invite us to be a part of their caregiving journeys. The partners who help us deliver the best home care services. And the referral sources who introduce us to the people who will become such a central part of our lives.
But just as much as we’re profoundly grateful for the people who allow us to live out our mission of caregiving, we’re also in awe of the moments we have the opportunity to share with them.
Like the daily moments of joy of a great grandmother who can remain in her beloved home while she ages. Or the smiles of recognition from a father living with dementia. It’s the moments of triumph for a son who’s navigating a challenging recovery from major surgery. The first snuggles between a new mom and her precious baby. The surprise in the eyes of a sister with a disability who has discovered a way to do something she thought she’d never do. The prideful voice of a veteran in the moment he shares a memory about his days of service. And the instant a woman realizes she has the support she needs to be a daughter again.
We live for these moments. And we don’t take a single one of them for granted.
Witnessing these moments, caring for the people who are living these experiences – that is our calling. And we couldn’t be more grateful for the way every moment impacts our organization. And enriches our lives.
Happy Thanksgiving, FirstLight friends."

474,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/mothersday-firstlighthomecare/,"“Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother.” This telling quote from Oprah Winfrey is a great segue into the celebration of Mother’s Day and what it has to offer your family, friends, children and of course, moms. If you are preparing to spend time with Mom this Sunday, enjoy these last minute Mother’s Day Gift Ideas from FirstLight Home Care!
As caregivers, we know that moms can sometimes go uncredited for everything they do, which is why we want to help you make their Mother’s Day one to remember. If you still haven’t gotten your mom a gift for Sunday, here are some last-minute thoughts on how you can show you care:
- Cook her dinner: If you can still smell mom’s cooking from when you were a kid, now is the time to return the favor. Make her one of her favorite dishes and bring the dinner to her, or try and recreate that one meal she made for you whenever you needed a mother’s touch.
- Write her a letter: If your mom grew up before the digital age, surprise her with a thoughtful, hand-written letter. Even if you plan to visit her on Mother’s Day, sending a letter confessing what she means to you will tug at her heartstrings and give her something tangible to hold on to after you return to your busy life.
- Give to her favorite cause: What is your mother passionate about and what keeps her up at night? Chances are high that there’s a charity established to help ease her worries and warm her heart, so help her give back by donating to her favorite cause. You can make the gift more special by presenting her with a receipt from your donation to show her how much you care.
- Digital picture frame: If you have a number of photos of you and your family on a digital camera or your phone, turn them into an interactive digital photo frame to give to mom. You can buy digital frames with large amounts of space and in a variety of shapes and sizes. This will allow mom catch a glimpse of her favorite kids and grandchildren any time – even from far away.
- A day for her: If your mom is one of the hardest working ladies you know, give her a day to relax and recharge. Stop by her favorite local salon, spa, massage therapist, and restaurant to make appointments for her to enjoy a special day.
Giving back to mom doesn’t have to require expensive and flashy gifts – just simple, thoughtful and sentimental tokens of your love and appreciation. If you have a Mom, grandmother or other family member who you think of as your Mom, who is at a place in their lives where they need assistance, the culture of care at First Light HomeCare can help put your mind at ease.

475,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/moving-your-elderly-parents/,"Moving is one of the most stressful events a person will experience in their lifetime. Going to a new home at any stage in life is not an easy decision and it can be extremely emotional. When it’s an elderly parent, that can bring even more challenges.
Whether you are moving your elderly parents into a new home, a senior living community, or having them live with you, the entire process can be overwhelming. This is especially true for their adult children, as any of the major decisions will fall on them. Of course, everyone involved in a loved one’s care wants to ensure the transition goes smoothly!
There are countless things to consider before moving elderly parents for senior home care. But it all starts with having the conversation. And the timing of that talk is critical.
So, before you jump in, think about how you will handle that discussion. Remember to be sensitive to your parent’s feelings. They can have a lot of anxiety about any kind of change, and relocating for caregiving services is a big deal!
Do your research, especially if you are moving parents to a senior living community. You want to make sure the new place they call home meets as many of their needs as possible from the get-go.
Create a plan (and a Plan B) and make sure your loved one and any family members are all on board. This will make any move easier and reduce the number of surprises along the way.

476,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/multiple-generations-living-together/,"When my dad was alive, he used to say “18 and out.” In his mind, he paid for our college and after that it was time to fly on our own. It was an expectation I never tested. In the 30+ years since I left college, I went home for visits but never to live. We took pride in being self-sufficient and “making it on our own.”
Now, my 25-year-old son still lives with me. He has a part-time job making $9.25/hour and pays for his own car insurance, health insurance and gas. That’s about all he can afford. I pay all the living expenses, food, utilities, TV and cable bills. And my college age daughter? I just worry that she’ll be able to get a good job after graduating.
I know that the economy has made it tough for people to afford the expenses of daily living. Sometimes I’m just afraid he’ll be living with me forever, versus learning the valuable lessons we all learned from being independent.
And he’s not the only one. We’ve all heard about aging parents who have to move back in with their kids because they need help. It’s what is known as role reversal: your parents took care of you, but now you are taking care of them. This I totally understand.
However, a study at UCLA makes me scared for the future of my children. Approximately 194,000 Californians between the ages of 54 and 64 had to move back in with their parents between 2005 and 2012. This wasn’t because they needed to be caregivers; instead, they moved back home because of their own financial hardship. That’s a 67.6% increase! This is the age (my age group by the way) when you think people are financially stable and should be well on their way to retirement. And among 18 – 29-year olds, 1.6 Californians have gone back to live in their childhood bedrooms. Talk about role reversal!
This isn’t isolated to California, but will continue to happen in more and more states if the unemployment rate does not continue to decrease.
Maybe it’s time we redefine the meaning of “family.”
I envision a future where a nuclear family no longer lives alone. There will be post-college age children, parents and grandparents all living under one roof. There may be two Moms, two Dads, or even grandparents raising their grandchildren. So instead of learning about independence and being out on your own, kids may benefit in different ways from multiple generations living together. I know that younger people have a grip on technology that we will never have since we didn’t grow up with cell phones, computers and iPads. They are whiz kids and can keep us up-to-date on the new-fangled communication devices.
However, my generation and that of my parents have more wisdom and experience when it comes to life lessons. We have been where they are and have the foresight to know many of the obstacles they will encounter on the journey of life. Unlike young people who make hasty decisions, we have learned patience and can save them from making some of the mistakes we have made.
We should not see moving in together as “defeat” or an inconvenience or giving up your own life. Instead, we should embrace the experience of different perspectives and celebrate family no matter what form it takes."
477,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/must-have-documents-for-your-aging-parents/,"Too often, we are caught off guard: an sudden illness or accident robs us of our ability to plan ahead when it comes to critical healthcare and legal decisions. We wait until a crisis hits, when we are least capable of making rational decisions.
Whether you’re a baby boomer or a senior citizen, there are some must have documents to protect yourself and your loved ones. Planning ahead will ensure that your children will be able to make health and legal decisions on your behalf should you be unable to do so.
No one wants to think about dying or being incapacitated. However, too often families are caught off guard. Often, we do not like to talk to our children about financial issues, citing a right to privacy. However, this must be balanced with their ability to be prepared should a major change in our life occur such as hospitalization, a move to a retirement community, or in the event of applying for Medicaid, Social Security, VA benefits, etc.
Here are some crucial documents that FirstLight Home Care recommends having organized in one place with multiple copies:
- Medical Power of Attorney or Advanced HealthCare Directive – enables someone to make healthcare decisions for you should you be unable to do so. HIPPA laws make it illegal for doctors to share any healthcare information about you unless you have it in writing. Therefore, you need to designate one individual (called an agent) who can make your healthcare decisions regarding artificial life support, resuscitation, intravenous feedings and other end-of-life decisions. It may be smart to name more than one agent, in case the first cannot be reached in an emergency. This document is only valid if you are unable to make your own health care decisions – your stated agent will have no authority or legal access to your medical information while you are able to make decisions. This document can be voided at any time and a new one made should you change your mind.
- Consent for Release of Information/HIPAA – you may have been asked to sign this document when you visited your doctor’s office. This form authorizes the release of medical information to insurance companies, family members, or anyone else you choose.
- Durable Power of Attorney (POA) for Finances – this document and a medical power of attorney are two different documents. A Durable Power of Attorney for Finances allows you to name the individual to manage your financial affairs in the event you cannot. This POA can access your bank records, sell your property, and deal with insurance companies. This document remains valid until death.
- Last Will & Testament – This document covers you after you have died and spells out who is responsible for settling your estate. You will spell out how you want your assets and personal property dealt with after your death. Without a will, you will die “intestate”, meaning that state law will determine who gets what.
- Other Healthcare & Financial Information That Should Be Easily Accessible
- List of all bank accounts
- Pension and 401K documents
- Bills on Auto pay
- Tax Returns
- Life, Auto, Home and Health Insurance Policies
- Deeds to all property
- Title & registration to all cars
- Credit card accounts (front and back)
- List of all debts including mortgage information
- Marriage documents
- Online user names and passwords
- Access to safe deposit boxes and keys
- Birth certificates
- Driver’s License
- Social Security card
- Passport
Understand that elder law can be quite complex, and laws vary state to state. Keep multiple copies of this information in different places in the event of a fire or burglary. It is best to have this information electronically (on a thumb drive) as well as in hard copy.

478,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/must-have-traits-for-every-caregiver/,"In the United States, over 65 million people provide care for a chronically ill, disabled or aged family member or friend, according to the National Alliance for Caregiving. Even though 29 percent of the U.S. population is providing care, this doesn’t mean that all 29 percent is cut out for the job. Anyone can attest to the joys, rewards and challenges of caring for another but how do you know what characteristics should be present when looking to hire a caregiver for an elderly loved one? Keep the following traits in mind when you’re on the hunt:
Companionship
A caregiver should be able to offer a sense of companionship to the older person. They have to be willing to sit without feeling like they should be doing something at all times. Many times, home care providers offer this service on an hourly basis.
Flexibility
Sometimes issues arise when a caregiver has to arrive early or stay late. There are many elderly individuals who suffer from dementia or Alzheimer’s and can’t be left alone for any period of time. Is the caregiver willing and able to arrange his/her schedule to fit that of yours or your elderly loved one?
Attention to detail
Often times a caregiver has to notice a patient’s change in skin color, eating habits or moods because the doctor isn’t around every day to monitor them. This isn’t something that requires medical training but caregivers are responsible for observing changes and taking the appropriate course of action if they do feel that a trip to the doctor is necessary.
Common interests
This isn’t a must-have but identifying commonalities between your elderly loved one and his/her caregiver can be beneficial for both parties and will make the caregiving process much easier. It helps establish a bond that goes beyond essential caregiving duties.
The most important thing to consider when looking to hire a caregiver for your elderly loved one is to thoroughly consider his/her needs and decide what he/she would want most out of the relationship."
479,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/my-friend-is-a-family-caregiver-how-can-i-help/,"When one of your good friends becomes the family caregiver to an elderly parent or loved one, they may begin feeling stressed, overwhelmed and they can experience a plethora of emotions. They might need help, but they’re afraid to ask.
Here are 6 ways you can support a friend as they embark on their family caregiving journey.
Just listen. Your friend may need someone to talk to and share the concerns, frustrations or sadness they may be experiencing. Just listen and allow them to vent their feelings. Many family caregivers often feel very alone, and some can be suffering from depression due to their situation. Listening to them can be the first in helping them feel less isolated.
Offer to be there for whatever they need. Don’t wait for your friend to ask you for help. Ask them “what can I do today to help you.” Caregiving is exhausting and stressful. Helping your friend define what support they need and what specific role you can take on will provide comfort and make a difference.
Help them get organized. For new caregivers especially, it can seem like a daunting task to figure out where to start and how to keep daily tasks organized. It’s easy to get lost in the weeds of caregiving and to feel out of control with so much to do. As a friend, you can help them bring the big picture back into focus. Work alongside them to organize their daily routines into a system that will keep them – and anyone else helping with family caregiver responsibilities – stay on track.
Give them your time. Many family caregivers feel locked into a whirlwind of daily routines caring for their loved one, and they have no time for themselves. The greatest gift you can give your friend is the gift of time. Offer to sit with their loved one while your caregiver friend takes a well-deserved break, even if just for a few hours a week.
Help them with research. When you’re the family caregiver, it can feel like there’s not enough time to do everything. Something like researching to find appropriate senior-focused services for the loved one in their care just might be the last thing on their “to do” list. A great way to lend a hand is to do some of the legwork for them and determine the best sources and local services, like Firstlight Home Care, that could assist them in the care of their loved one.
Just be who you are…a friend. Your friend will go through a lot when they become the family caregiver, and they need your friendship now more than ever. The best thing you can do for them is be a friend. Bring over food, send encouraging notes or texts, take them out for a cup of coffee or glass of vino, and don’t exclude them from activities you’re doing just because they’ve declined past invitations. Many caregivers need time to figure out the “new normal” in their lives and it can take time to adjust.
We’ve been there when a friend needs support, and we have found these 6 caregiving tips to be very helpful, and greatly appreciated.

480,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/myths-about-osteoporosis/,"Osteoporosis is known as the “silent disease” because many people do not realize they have it until they fall or experience a fracture. There are certain things we know: osteoporosis is a disease in which the bones become more and more fragile as they lose density, usually due to aging, menopause, and other factors like lack of calcium and vitamin D in the diet.We know that osteoporosis is predicted to affect as many as half of all Americans over age 50 by the year 2020.
However, there are still many myths and misconceptions surrounding the illness which FirstLight Home Care would like to explain so you can more accurately prevent and cope with this debilitating illness:
- Only women are prone to osteoporosis. While it is true that women are more susceptible to osteoporosis (particularly Caucasian), it can afflict men and
people virtually of any race or age. Unfortunately, more and more young women
and men are being diagnosed with osteoporosis due to hormonal imbalances and poor nutrition. Between one-quarter and one-third of all hip fractures occur in men and estimates show that 30% of all men over 50 will have an osteoporosis-related fracture during their lifetime.
- If you have osteoporosis, you can feel your bones getting weaker. In the early stages of osteoporosis, you may have no symptoms. Most people do not realize they have osteoporosis until they fall or fracture a bone.
- The osteoporosis test exposes you to too much radiation. One of the best ways to diagnose osteoporosis is through a bone mineral density test using a central DXA (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry) machine. It is totally painless, takes 5-10 minutes and uses very little radiation. According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation, you are exposed to 10-15 times more radiation from flying in a plane roundtrip between New York and San Francisco.
- Your bones don’t grow after adolescence. Although most of us think our bones stop growing after young adulthood, making healthy lifestyle choices when you’re older can still have a positive impact on your skeleton, says Felicia Cosman, MD, clinical director of NOF. “Even small gains add up over time,” she adds. According to research from Tufts University, postmenopausal women who did strength-training twice a week for a year gained 1 percent to 2 percent in bone density. Any weight-bearing workout can provide similar benefits. The key: Keep increasing the intensity.
- If you drink a lot of milk and exercise, you won’t suffer from osteoporosis. Although drinking milk and exercise are important to preventing osteoporosis, there are other risk factors which can contribute to the disease. These can include: a family history, having a low body weight, too much sodium and caffeine and lack of Vitamin D.
- Consuming a lot of calcium will prevent osteoporosis. Taking an excessive amount of calcium does you no good because your body cannot absorb it. Instead, estimate the amount of calcium you get from foods on a typical day to determine whether a supplement is right for you.
- Osteoporosis is a common illness all over the world. Unfortunately, the United States has the highest incidence of osteoporosis, but there are other areas where this disorder is relatively rare, even among the older segments of the population. Singapore and Hong Kong have relatively low rates of osteoporosis and many African cultures are almost immune to osteoporosis.
If you or a loved one are suffering from osteoporosis and need in home care, FirstLight Home Care is ready to help. Find about more about our care options or read more about osteoporosis itself."

Eating disorders are complex illnesses that can be life-threatening for the young and old. February 23 to March 1 is the National Eating Disorders Awareness Week and it was started to support families and
communities who are struggling with this disease. It also brings awareness and helps to overcome the misconceptions following these mental health disorders.
This disease does not target just adolescent women, it is an illness that strikes all age groups, genders and demographics. One person in every hundred people in the United States struggle with an eating disorder* and there are many misconceptions surrounding this mental illness:
- Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia are the most talked about eating disorders, but there are actually 9 different illnesses ranging from food intake to exercising issues.
- Eating disorders are not just food restriction issues, but can also be over-exercising, overeating, and even night eating.
- Eating disorders are considered life-threatening mental illnesses and can be fatal.
- Eating disorders do not discriminate. While younger women are more commonly affected, and talked about in the media, eating disorders impact older women too. Plus, millions of men and boys battle all forms of the illness*.
- One of the biggest misconception with an eating disorder is that people do this on purpose. In fact, they don’t. An eating disorder is a mental disorder. It is a significant health problem that to date, doctors do not know its origin.
At FirstLight Home Care, we understand the struggles of both mental and physical illness and we focus our support on families in need. Our in-home personal care services work with families to help with special diets, eating schedules, and meal preparations. We work with clients, families, and nutrition professionals to plan and prepare meals according to specific needs of our clients. Our personal care services are customized purposely for you.

482,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/national-eye-donor-month/,"Are you an eye donor? Many of us have checked the eye donor box on our driver’s license or state ID card, but do you really know what it means? Did you know you can be an eye donor even if you have cataracts, bad vision or have had lasik surgery?
Although the cornea (the clear tissue in the front of the eye) is usually the only part of the eye that can be transplanted, the sclera (white of the eye) can also be used in some surgeries, and eye banks accept the whole eye for research and education. In fact, every donation can help between 1 – 2 people and everyone is a universal donor (unlike blood type). Donors are usually between the ages of 2 and 70, and the eye must be harvested between 8 – 12 hours after death. In very rare cases, an eye donor may be living
History of Corneal Transplants
In 2013, there were 48,229 corneal transplants performed in the U.S. Eye transplants go all the way back to the 1800s, with the first eye bank being established more than 50 years ago. Since it became common in 1961, more than 1,000,000 men, women and children have been blessed with sight restoration. The beauty of a corneal transplant is that the surgery is 95 – 99% successful! The sad part? There are many more people awaiting corneal transplants than there are donors available.
Who needs a corneal transplant?
Generally, corneal transplants are performed on individuals who have a disease, scar or infection of the cornea. Most candidates have a condition called keratoconus where the central cornea has become so thin that neither glasses nor contacts are effective. People who are totally blind and cannot see light generally cannot benefit from corneal transplants. Neither can people who have macular degeneration, since in this case it is the retina versus the cornea that is affected.

Did you recently receive a cancer diagnosis? Have a chronic debilitating illness? March is National Optimism Month, and as hard as it is, you have to try and maintain a positive attitude. You have to take all your negative thoughts and stuff them under your mattress where you can’t see or reach them.
My Mom was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and lupus when she was 20-years-old and had a colostomy when she was 40. She lived until she was 80, even though her hands were crippled and she was in a wheelchair. We gave her last rights three times, but she always bounced back. Yet every day, she made me laugh and always had something nice to say. No doctor’s diagnosis could get her down despite some of the grim prognosis’s she received. I asked her tell me from where she drew her positive strength.
She would quote Mark Twain and say: “If you want to cheer yourself up, try to cheer someone else up.” This was the philosophy she lived her life by, and her attitude was both contagious and infectious!
There are obvious health benefits to maintaining a upbeat attitude. Optimistic people have fewer heart attacks, less stress and healthier hearts than their pessimistic peers. Plus, a recent study at Mayo Clinic found that pessimism can lead to premature death, even when other factors such as age are discarded.
So it’s time to put your baggage aside, leave your comfort zone, and find your silver linings. Here are some tips to get you jumpstarted!
- Read a good book. Down in the dumps? Pick up a copy of David Mezzapelle’s “Contagious Optimism” which will inspire you with his stories of amazing life turnarounds. Amazon describes it as a “Chicken Soup for the Soul” meets “Pay It Forward” on steroids!
- Keep a grateful journal. Sound corny? It works. Every morning when you get up, write down one thing you are grateful for. Make a list of things that make your s mile. Know that life will throw you some curves, but collectively, the good and the bad is what makes you who you are.
- Cast aside your negative emotions. We all experience negative emotions – jealousy, hatred, sadness, depression and envy to name a few. You only have so much energy in a day. Do you want to spend it on thoughts that sap your energy or thoughts that energize you? Frowning all the time takes more muscles than smiling, plus smiling allows you to release serotonin. Princeton University says serotonin is also known as a happiness hormone because it contributes to feelings of well-being, Do you really want to give negativity that much real estate in your head?
- Keep your criticisms and blame to yourself. Have something bad to say? Keep it to yourself! Trying to blame all the ills in your life on someone else? Remember, that we each control our own destiny.
- Get off the couch. It’s so easy NOT to exercise. With Spring around the corner, and you can no longer use bad weather as an excuse, it’s time to get those winter creaks out of your limbs. We all can’t be a marathon runner, but we all can exercise to a certain degree. Even if you walk short distances or take the stairs instead of the elevator, it gets your aerobic juices flowing.
- Relax. As a workaholic, I find it hard to unwind. Drink a glass of wine (cheers!), go watch a movie or do something mindless. You need to have balance in your life.
- Choose happy. Every morning when you wake up, you can choose to be happy or grumpy. Yes, it’s a choice. Wake up on the wrong side of the bed? Shake it off or your day will be miserable.
My Mom used to say “God doesn’t give you more than you can handle” to which I would reply “but he is testing my upper limits!” Realistically I know you can’t be happy all the time. Each of us will have some bad days. It’s how we deal with the bumps along the way and move forward that counts.
Even though my Mom has passed away, I keep her driver’s license perched on my computer. It reminds me every day to think about the best possible outcomes versus the worse!"
485,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/national-prescription-drug-take-back-day/,"Want to jump on the spring-cleaning bandwagon while supporting an important public health issue? Take a moment this weekend and clean out your medicine cabinet. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is sponsoring a nationwide prescription drug “Take-Back” initiative in an effort to combat increased drug abuse and theft. On Saturday, April 30, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., the DEA will be collecting potentially dangerous, expired, unused and unwanted prescription drugs at collection sites nationwide. This is a free and anonymous service.
This is the second time the DEA is conducting the “Take-Back” initiative, due to the success of the first take-back day last September, when the American public turned in more than 121 tons of pills. More than 7 million Americans currently abuse prescription drugs, according to the 2009 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration’s National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Studies show that a majority of abused prescription drugs are obtained from family and friends, including the home medicine cabinet."
486,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/national-senior-health-fitness-day-stay-active-at-any-age/,"For many older adults, the past year has been a difficult one filled with social isolation and loneliness. It’s led to a more sedentary lifestyle and less time exercising, especially if their previous schedule involved going to a gym or working with a trainer. This, in turn, has triggered an overall decline in senior health, particularly in the areas of anxiety and depression.
Exercise can be the key to healthy aging, especially during pandemic times. Beyond improving mental health, exercise is important when it comes to strengthening the immune system and lowering risks for heart disease, stroke, diabetes and issues with cognition and memory. Movement and exercise are also vital for those with joint issues, pain and arthritis.
The good news is that with the weather breaking and COVID-19 vaccine access on the rise, it’s a great time to start fresh with a senior fitness program. Plus, with National Senior Health and Fitness Day just around the corner – on Wednesday, May 26th – it’s yet another reason to get moving. Where do you begin?
Start Small
When it comes to senior fitness, aim for around 30 minutes of physical activity per day to start. If that’s too much at once, break it up into smaller chunks. For instance, go for one 15-minute walk in the morning and one 15-minute walk in the afternoon. Work on improving your endurance and build up to exercising in full 30-minute blocks.
In addition, incorporate other activities into your day that add more motion and exercise. If you’re watching TV, for instance, take breaks to get up and move by doing things like:
- Walking laps around your house
- Simply stand up from a seated position several times during a commercial break
- Use weights to do upper body exercises while watching TV
Over time, you’ll build up strength and be able to perform more exercises over longer periods of time.
Play Music
If you’re having a hard time getting started, turn the TV off and put on some upbeat music. This will give you the motivation you need to start moving, even if it’s simply stretching.
Beyond serving as a source of motivation, music can also help cognitively since it relieves depression and anxiety. In fact, according to Harvard Health, “bright, cheerful music can make people of all ages feel happy, energetic and alert, and music even has a role in lifting the mood of people with depressive illnesses.”
Music also helps those seniors with health conditions, like Alzheimer’s and dementia. Studies have shown music may reduce agitation and improve behavioral issues that are common in the middle-stages of the disease.
Find a Friend
As social creatures, it makes sense to find a friend to exercise with. If you have both been vaccinated and it’s safe to socialize, get a workout in together. This will keep you both motivated to stick to a schedule and be consistent with your senior fitness routine. Your exercise time will also be more enjoyable and go by faster as you’re chatting and socializing. As a result, your workout will not only boost your physical health, but your emotional and social well-being too.
Practice Balance
Each year, approximately 2.5 million older adults are treated for fall injuries in the U.S. The good news is there are some exercises to prevent falls and improve balance.
Standing on one foot or walking from heel to toe across a room are good options, as are leg raises. Strengthening the core can also help to improve overall balance. If you’re concerned that a loved one is at risk for a fall, there are medical alert systems to consider as well.
Make Senior Fitness Fun
Part of the reason fitness and exercise can feel like a chore is because it’s not fun for many seniors. However, there are ways to incorporate enjoyable activities. For instance, take a walk to a park and have a picnic with a friend there. Attend a fitness class or join a local gym or community center. Having a professional by your side can help ensure exercises are performed properly, lowering the risk for injury.
You can also participate in hobbies that are active, such as working in your garden. These keep you up and moving, while allowing you time to be outdoors and enjoy nature. Another option is to put on music and dance. This can be in a formal class or simply at home in your living room.
Find Workouts Online
If you or a loved one is comfortable going online for senior fitness workouts, there are countless ones to choose from. These can replicate what it’s like to work with a trainer or attend a fitness class. Everything from YouTube to Instagram, as well as paid subscription options, are available online.
Make sure when you use an online source for senior health and fitness, you stick with it and schedule it into your week. It’s easy to get started with a class or two and then let exercise fall by the wayside. If you commit certain days and blocks of time to working out, you’ll have a better chance of meeting your goals. Once exercise becomes a habit and a regular part of your routine, it’s easier to keep up with it.
Eat Well
Exercise and a healthy diet go hand in hand. While you’re focused on adding movement into your daily routine, it’s also important to ensure you’re eating a balanced diet.
Talk to your doctor about a diet that will work well for you or turn to a nutritionist to design one that best supports your needs. There might be a specialized one if you have any medical conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease. However, in general, your diet should be filled with fruits and vegetables, lean meats and healthy grains.
Staying active is a challenge at any age. As we get older, though, it’s even more important. A sedentary lifestyle can lead to many physical issues and trigger anxiety and depression. However, studies show that maintaining regular physical activity can prevent common diseases and boost immune function. Exercise also produces endorphins (the “feel good” hormone), which serve as a stress reliever.
If you’re concerned about a senior loved one and their physical health and activity, talk to their doctor about designing an exercise and nutrition program that’s right for them. It’s also a good time to perform a general health screening to check for any new issues and keep tabs on their overall health.

487,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/natural-disasters-preparing-for-the-unexpected/,"“One person caring about another represents life’s greatest value.”
– Jim Rohn
While we can’t always predict or avert weather emergencies or natural disasters, we can try to prepare for them as much as possible so that we are always ready. Unexpected emergencies involving seniors can be even more challenging as many older adults have mobility issues, chronic health conditions, or they may not have family or friends nearby to assist them.
We were quite inspired when we learned about the above-and-beyond measures one of our FirstLight franchise owners took during the recent hurricanes. When the massive storms blew through South Carolina, FirstLight Home Care of Savannah/Hilton Head owner Jenny Price was more than prepared. Because she and her team were proactive and had a plan for natural disasters in place, they were able to evacuate several of their senior clients to a safe place and care for them during the storms without missing a beat. Their story demonstrates what it truly means to provide exceptional care…no matter what the circumstances.
Giving Clients a Safe Haven
When Jenny Price learned that several of her elderly clients would need to evacuate the area, she immediately made sure they were taken care of. Some of these clients did not have any family in town, one was on hospice and another was taking care of his wife by himself. Jenny arranged for these families to be taken to a safe place and to continue being cared for by their FirstLight caregivers.
Jenny booked a block of rooms with a hotel that was out of the storm’s path. She made the hotel her caregiving team’s home base for five days to ensure clients would continue receiving their regular care.
Caregivers helped clients pack up the necessities from their homes, they accompanied clients during travel to the hotel, and they assisted in unpacking and helping the seniors settle into their temporary home. While there, caregivers provided door-to-door service to each client, making morning, midday and evening rounds. Clients received the same quality care and service and their families were grateful for the peace of mind.
This amazing FirstLight team pulled together to make sure everyone remained safe and experienced minimal disruption in their lives, despite what Mother Nature had in store.

488,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/navigating-senior-care-options/,"By the year 2020, 56 million Americans will be 65 and older.
By 2050, that number will reach 84 million. Nearly 70 percent of Americans who reach 65 will not be able to care for themselves without assistance at some point in their lives.*
Many adult children can attest to this – most elderly would prefer to age at home. In fact, 90% of people aged 65+ want to stay in their homes for as long as possible. And 80% think their current home is where they will always live. However, remaining at home might not always be the right option for your aging parent.
Finding senior care options can be complex and confusing. Many seniors, as well as their adult daughters or sons, are unaware of the different possibilities and may not know what’s best. Furthermore, senior care options have evolved significantly over the years, offering many more choices for different levels of care.
Do you know what’s best for Mom? There may not be an easy, clear answer. Here is an overview of some common senior care options to help you navigate the choices and determine the ideal level of care for your parent.
If Mom needs:
- To downsize or just make things easier
- Basic care, such as medication management
- A sense of community, to be around people with like interests and in a similar stage in life
- Peace of mind to know that if quality care is needed down the road, it may be offered within the same community
Independent Living Communities may be the answer. This option helps seniors who need a bit of assistance from time to time, and could offer amenities such as light housekeeping and laundry. It also may feature different housing options designed to meet the needs of seniors as their needs change. Some communities have assisted living accommodations for residents who may have a greater need for care in the future.
If Mom needs:
- 24-hour support
- Access to medical care
- Assistance with eating, bathing, dressing, etc.
- Social stimulation
- To maintain some independence
Assisted Living Facilities are a great option for seniors who want or need help with some of the activities of daily living, such as cooking meals, getting to the bathroom in the middle of the night and transportation to and from appointments. These facilities offer safety and security, while also promoting privacy and independence. Shared dining and recreational areas encourage socializing with other seniors. And assistance is always just a phone call away.
However, many parents find the idea of moving to an assisted living facility to be depressing and just one step away from losing their independence. If it turns out to be the best option, how do you go about convincing your parent that it’s time think about moving to assisted living? Read this piece for advice.
If Mom needs:
- Constant attention
- Full-time medical care
- Help with getting in and out of bed, feeding, bathing and dressing
- Daily meals, activities and housekeeping
A Nursing Home might be the best option. Nursing homes differ from other senior housing facilities in that they provide a high level of medical care. Experienced personnel, including physicians and nurses, are on staff. Other medical professionals, such as occupational or physical therapists are also available, allowing delivery of medical procedures and therapies on site.
If Mom needs:
- Conversation and companionship
- Basic help around the house, such as light housekeeping, laundry service or meal preparation
- Transportation to and from appointments
- Reminders to take her medication
- Assistance with eating, bathing or mobility
Non-Medical Home Care fills the gap between people needing medically skilled services and people who need non-medical companionship and help around the house. Home care offers companion care and personal care services to help seniors maintain their freedom and independence. A wide range of companion care services can be offered at home, in the hospital or in healthcare facility settings, and personal care services can assist with the activities of daily living.
FirstLight Home Care provides other senior care services such as dementia care, hospital readmission rescue, travel companion services, as well as respite care to give family caregivers temporary relief from caring for a loved one.

Earlier this month, Representatives Charlie Crist (D-FL) and Tom Suozzi (D-NY) introduced the Home Modification and Accessibility Act, which creates financial incentives for homeowners to proactively make accessibility upgrades to their homes. The bill would help older adults afford home modifications, allowing them to live safely and comfortably in their own homes as they age.
AARP reports that around 90 percent of people ages 65 and older would prefer to age in their homes rather than move to an assisted living community or nursing home. When compared, aging at home is cheaper and more cost-effective than living in a nursing home.
The Home Modification and Accessibility Act empowers Americans to make decisions about where and how they live by offsetting the costs associated with making home modifications through a penalty-free early retirement withdrawal and lifetime tax deduction of up to $30,000.
By offering financial incentives through this legislation, people can plan ahead, upgrade their homes and better prepare to age in place. Accessibility upgrades in the home can also help reduce falls, injuries and other health problems, which can potentially reduce medical expenses.

491,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/new-study-indicates-home-care-is-on-rise/,"While franchising in the home care industry only began in the last 20 years, the past 10 years alone have yielded some tremendous growth. A new study released by the web portal Franchise Direct indicates that the increase in demand for home care is not only the result of an aging population; now more than ever people desire to age in place surrounded by the comforts of their home and loved ones.
According to the study, 70 percent of American seniors spend the rest of their lives in the place where they celebrated their 65th birthday—even though an overwhelming number of them still require some assistance. The California Department of Aging, for example, estimates that 30 percent of women and 17 percent of men over the age of 75 need assistance with personal care.
At FirstLight Home Care, we’re excited to be part of a new movement that is reinventing the way we care for our elderly or those affected by a chronic condition or illness. I was astounded to read some of the findings included in this revealing report. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Labor predict 27 million people will use paid, long-term care services in any setting by 2050. And while the study touts many established care givers already excelling in the business, we feel our entry into the market couldn’t have come at a more opportune time.
As we continue our mission of growing our business in the decade ahead, we are equally excited to bring other caregivers on board. And as more people become aware of the advantages that in-home care provides, the more we will continue to spread our message. Media outlets, such as The Buffalo News in Buffalo, N.Y., are already taking note of the widening appeal of business franchising, particularly as it relates to the in-home care market. Take a moment to look deeper: What next steps will you decide to take?
Next week: Watch for my tips on how to start a conversation with a loved one about the need for providing long-term care."
492,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/new-year-new-you/,"Happy New Year! Have you made your resolution yet? As the holidays come to a close, I wanted to take some time to discuss a resolution that’s on the top of many peoples’ list: staying fit. It’s very important especially for seniors to take care of themselves as they get older. Many don’t realize, however, that this can be done with a few simple adjustments to one’s diet and daily routine. Below are some fitness and nutrition tips that fit the unique needs of the seniors in our lives.
FITNESS TIPS
Talk To A Doctor
Before starting your loved one on an exercise program, consult a doctor. He or she may have limitations and your doctor can provide suggestions as to how to work around those.
Start Slowly
Don’t let your loved one jump into a strenuous workout right away. There are benefits to simple exercises such as stretching and walking. Overdoing it in the beginning may cause soreness and prevent you from making it part of your daily routine. It’s also important that seniors wear comfortable clothing and footwear appropriate for the temperature, humidity and activity.
Join An Organized Sport
Many sports, ranging from bowling to tennis, have added competitive sectors for seniors. Ask around and find a sport that fits your interests, lifestyle and ability-level. Water exercises are also great because they promote strength without stressing your joints.
NUTRITION TIPS
Switch It Up
Turn meal planning into a fun experience by planning one new meal, trying one new food item each week or looking for new ways to prepare your favorite dishes. Be sure it’s a well-balanced meal—complete with fruits, vegetables, grain, meat and dairy. Also to avoid dehydration, seniors should aim to drink six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily. Drinking water can help combat ailments and reduce hunger.
Enrich Foods
Try spreading nut butters on toast and crackers or adding cheese, lean meats and extra veggies to sandwiches, soups and rice. Also try spicing up bland foods by using lemon juice, herbs and spices.
Sensible Snacking
Though everyone likes a treat once in a while, it is important to choose the right snacks. Limit indulgence in sweets in favor of cheese and crackers, fruit or meal replacement drinks like Ensure® or Boost®, as they are higher in nutrients than cookies or candy.
*Before making any dietary changes, be sure to check with your physician first"
493,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/new-year-shows-signs-of-recovery-for-franchises/,"A recent report by IHS Global Insight for the International Franchise Association Educational Foundation predicts modest growth for franchise businesses in 2012, in areas such as number of establishments, employment, output and contributions to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). This comes after three years of restrained growth due to the recession.
The outlook for growth differs among industries with personal services franchises expected to be a leader at 6.2 percent output growth. Overall, franchise business jobs are projected to grow 2.1 percent, with an increase of 168,000 jobs.
Here at FirstLight, we have a very positive outlook on 2012’s forecast based on 2011 achievements and we’re looking forward to another successful year. Over the past 18 months, we have achieved the following:

2019 is just days away and the beginning of a new year is a perfect time to evaluate our lives, address challenges and move forward with positivity. For caregivers, this is an especially important time, so we’ve put together a collection of family caregiver New Year’s resolutions just for you:
In 2019, grow your support circle so that you’re not doing everything by yourself. Create a support team of family, friends and/or local resources, like FirstLight Home Care, to help you be the best caregiver you can be.
Ask family or friends to help with the loved one you’re caring for to support you with specific tasks: providing companionship or hands-on care, managing finances, doing research, running errands or helping with household chores.
In 2019, block out break-times for yourself – every day. Even if you’re taking mini-breaks throughout the day, do something simple and positive to help reduce the stress of caregiving.
- Conduct a two-minute meditation, breathing or calming exercise.
- Take a minute or two to stretch and enjoy a quiet moment.
- Get up and walk outside.
- Connect with family and friends with a phone call or video chat.
In 2019, connect with the loved one in your care by doing an activity you both enjoy. Find fun activities you can do together – at home, or in the community – to make caregiving feel like less of a chore and more of a time to grow your relationship. Adding activities, such as doing a puzzle, going to the movies, playing a board game, or taking a stroll around the neighborhood will create a special time that you both can enjoy.
In 2019, schedule time off – weekly. Caregiver burnout is real. One way to prevent burnout is to set aside time for yourself. Find a family member, friend, volunteer or a professional caregiver to help manage the care of your loved one – even if just for a couple hours one morning a week – so that you can take time for yourself.
- Hire an in-home caregiver for a few hours each week to help with companion care and other personal care responsibilities
- Enroll your older adult in an adult day program
- Connect with professional organizations with respite care programs
In 2019, don’t just manage the symptoms, help improve them. Work with your loved one to lower blood pressure, get control of glucose levels, eat right, stop smoking and get more exercise. Seniors who are physically healthy tend to be happier, more energetic and easier to be around. Family caregivers should follow this same advice!

FirstLight Home Care 2016 Caregiver of the Year
Being a family caregiver is both a rewarding and challenging role. Becoming a primary source of care – when you used to be a daughter, son, sister, brother, wife, husband, friend – can be overwhelming. And it can place a strain on your most valued relationships.
As a FirstLight caregiver, I work with many clients who are fortunate to have a loved one also providing support and participating in their care. While each situation is different, many of the challenges are the same. I often hear family caregivers ask questions like, “How do I get my mom to (fill in the blank)?” Or, “Is he just giving me a hard time, or does he really not remember?” Or, “Why won’t my husband listen to me when I tell him he has to do this?”
And, almost as frequently, family caregivers share that they wish they knew how to be better at caregiving.
I’m here to tell you, there’s good news. First, you’re likely a much better family caregiver than you even realize. The fact is, the relationship your loved one has with you has a significant impact on the quality of his or her life. Even on what may feel like your worst day, you’re making a difference.
And second, there are strategies you can apply to your role as a caregiver that can help you become more confident and get better results.
Following are some of the strategies I employ everyday in my role as a professional caregiver. I hope they help you on your caregiving journey in the New Year.
- Remember that everyone is an individual. Many family caregivers struggle to relate to the person they’re caring for. What you think would work for you won’t necessarily work for your loved one. Think about what’s important to your loved and what motivates him or her as an individual, and incorporate those things into your caregiving.
- Be flexible. Especially for older adults, their status and their behavior may be very different from day to day. If you expect consistency, you will likely become easily frustrated.
- Communicate what’s in it for them. I care for many people who just don’t want to let anyone clean their homes. Or they don’t want to eat. Or take a shower. Repeatedly telling them they have to do something isn’t likely to convince them. Instead, ask them to show you something or try something to help solve a problem. For example, if your loved one always insists his or her house is clean and resists letting you tidy up, start by asking if you can test out a vintage vacuum cleaner. Or shine up a favorite piece of silver. You may get somewhere.
- Relate tasks to activities your loved one enjoys. As a person ages, simple daily tasks may seem overwhelming. Or may become a source of fear. Try to relate the overwhelming or frightening task to something your loved one enjoys. For example, if your mother loves to go to the beauty salon but refuses to take a bath, talk her through it by relating the steps of the bath to the salon experience.
- Include your loved one in tasks. Another way to help a loved one feel less overwhelmed and afraid is by including them in tasks. For example, if your loved one resists leaving the house, consider going on a shopping trip where he or she helps look for items on the list – like a scavenger hunt. Involvement may be an effective way to distract your loved one from fear or anxiety. And the activity may even help with cognitive function.
- Do things in steps. Breaking tasks into multiple steps can be a good way to make them less overwhelming and easier to accomplish.
- Use desirable activities as motivation. There will always be things your loved one has to do, but doesn’t want to do. Think about doing those things first, before the things they or like to do. This provides something to look forward to and may help get your loved one motivated.
- Listen to the stories. No matter how many times you’ve heard them, listen as if it were the first time. The listening creates trust. And really hearing what your loved one is telling you can help you better understand what’s meaningful for them.
- Don’t take it personally. One of the most difficult things for many family caregivers is dealing with the emotions they feel about their loved ones’ condition or behavior. It’s not unusual for age or sickness to cause dramatic shifts in memory, behavior and even mood. Try to remember that, in most cases, it really isn’t about you.
- Ask for help and take breaks. Being a caregiver is emotionally and physically demanding. To have the stamina to do it every day, you have to find a way to also take care of yourself. Seek professional advice. Join a support group. Take the time to do something you love that’s just for you.
Being a family caregiver can be beautiful, lonely, rewarding, grueling experience. Know that you are making a profound difference in your loved one’s life. That there are resources out there to help you. And that you’re not alone.
Part of your support network.

496,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/nine-halloween-safety-tips-for-older-adults/,"Halloween is a fun time of year for both kids and adults. But for our elderly loved ones, it can be stressful and a little scary, especially if they live alone. A constant stream of trick-or-treaters knocking on the door can be a bit unsettling and intimidating – add scary masks and high-spirited kids and the unknown is greatly magnified.
Our elderly loved ones should feel safe and secure on Halloween, whether they choose to hand out candy or not. Here are nine Halloween safety tips to consider:
- Check your lights and keep them on, even if you’re away from home. A dark house may invite unwanted guests. Whether you’re going to be gone that night or at home handing out Halloween treats, make sure your porch light is working and that your home’s exterior and the interior is brightly lit.
- Look outside before opening the door. Even though it’s Halloween, always check to see who is standing outside before answering the door. If it’s a group of unruly teens or a lone adult, you might want to keep the door closed as a safety precaution.
- Keep all visitors outside. Stay inside when passing out candy. Do not invite strangers into your home or allow them to use the restroom or your phone. You can also place a bowl of candy on the front porch rather than handing it out. Include a sign that says: “Happy Halloween! One per person, please.”
- Keep a clear pathway. Keep all walkways, both inside and out, clear from flame-lit jack-o-lanterns, oversized decorations, and home décor. Removing items that pose tripping hazards will not only help keep aging loved ones safe, but also the children coming to the door whose vision may be impaired by a mask.
- Avoid using candles: Instead, use battery-powered lights to illuminate your jack-o-lanterns. Flames from candles can pose a fire hazard. Part of a costume could catch on fire or, if forgotten, it could cause a house fire.
- Avoid being alone. Instead of having your elderly loved one hand out Halloween candy alone, make it an evening. This is especially important if your loved one is living with dementia or physical limitations. It will make everyone feel more comfortable, and they’ll be safe throughout the night! If you can’t be there, we can. Our FirstLight® Companion Care Services provide visiting services for a few hours, or even overnight. We can be there to help distribute Halloween candy and, in between trick-or-treaters, we can share a conversation, play games or watch their favorite television shows.
- Hang a sign: Sorry, out of candy. If you’re not handing out candy or if you run out of candy before trick-or-treating hours end, leave a sign on the front door or porch. This will deter ghosts and goblins from walking up to your front door and ringing your doorbell. Don’t forget to leave your lights on.
- One for them…two for me. The Halloween candy bowl may do more harm than good. More than likely your elderly loved one does not have access to such foods on a regular basis. Having a bowl full of candy may become a temptation and cause them to overindulge. Additionally, eating hard or chewy candy could be harmful to their dentures or become a choking hazard, especially if the senior has difficulty swallowing. Consider limiting how much candy is distributed or handout alternative treats such as Halloween stickers or temporary tattoos, mini cans of play-doh, glow sticks or glow-in-the-dark jewelry.
- Costume safety tips: If an elderly adult is dressing up in a costume, it shouldn’t be restrictive or something that may cause them to trip. Masks and other accessories that can block vision are also a bad idea for seniors that may already struggle with poor vision
Halloween is a scary-fun night for people of all ages. By taking a few extra precautions will help your aging loved one to be safe and able to enjoy all the fun. As the seasons continue to change, be sure to check out these other Autumn safety tips for older adults.
We are proud to CHAMPION the family caregiver, offering empathy, advice, and support for those who provide countless hours of care to their loved ones. At FirstLight Home Care we want to provide a helping hand, relieve some of the stress that comes with caregiving and give you back a few hours in your overwhelmingly busy day."
497,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/no-one-can-take-of-your-mother-like-you-do/,"But FirstLight Home Care comes very, very close.
There is no doubt that as our mothers begin to age, it can be tough on sons, daughters and other family members to provide the level of care she needs. Whether you live close or far away, suddenly the roles are reversed and the dynamics of the parent-child relationship changes – in many cases, you take on the role of caretaker.
You have to make sure your Mom is taking her medication and gets to doctor appointments. You may be responsible for meal preparation, financial arrangements, and household chores, the day-to-day activities that keep your Mom safe. And most importantly, you want to give back all the love and attention she provided for you growing up. You fret, you worry, you feel guilty that you are not doing enough.
And the tricky part is chances are like many seniors, Mom wants to remain in her home. This can create a conundrum: how do you make sure she stays safe, happy and healthy? How do you make sure she is not alone?
The Quality Of Our Senior Caregivers
This is where FirstLight Home Care comes in. Our senior caregivers are compassionate, treating your Mom as if she were our own Mom. They often become very attached to your Mom and quickly take on the role of a surrogate family member. For our caregivers, providing home care is not a career, it’s a calling. They are passionate about providing the best in home care to give your Mom and you the peace of mind you deserve.
With FirstLight Home Care, it’s not just about physical care – it’s about emotional care as well.
Long or Short Term Care – FirstLight Home Care Is There!
Whether your Mom needs help on a short term basis – for a couple of hours a week or on a long term care basis with 24/7 home care–FirstLight Home Care has the caregiving staff to keep you covered.
Companionship, Personal Care and More
Simply having a visitor from time to time can make all the difference in the world to your Mom. From sharing a conversation to sharing a meal, FirstLight Home Care means a home care companion and something—or someone—to look forward to.
At FirstLight Home Care, you can rest assured your Mom will be in good hands with our senior care program. After all, she deserves the best? And we’ll deliver!"
498,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/non-medical-home-care-versus-medical-home-care/,"Because FirstLight Home Care provides non-medical home care, we are often asked about the difference between medical and non-medical care.
What Is Non Medical Care?
Non medical care is often referred to as “assisted living”, “transitional care”, or “private
duty” care. Non-Medical home care is usually provided by caregivers, certified nursing aides (CNAs), and home health aides (HHAs).
With non-medical in-home care, our caregivers provide personal and companion
care in the comfort of our client’s homes, wherever home may be – a residence,
assisted living facility, retirement community, etc. Too often seniors are lonely and need someone to talk to, someone who can help prepare meals, do their laundry, perform light housekeeping duties, take them to bingo, and help with the shopping and errands. Or maybe they need assistance with personal home care services or what is known as ADL or activities of daily living — such as getting dressed, showering, transferring from bed to chair, and more. Our caregivers do not administer medications, but they remind seniors and the elderly to take their medication on-time.
Non medical home care is not just for seniors – at FirstLight Home Care, many of our younger clients are recovering from plastic surgery, an orthopedic procedure, or are
new moms who just need a little help around the house for a short time. Our home companions also provide much needed peace of mind for young adults suffering from multiple sclerosis, cancer, diabetes and other chronic illnesses.
Did you know you can hamper your recovery if you try and do too much too soon? Our caregivers make sure you get the rest you need, enabling you to recover at home faster.
Plus, who doesn’t want to be in their own bed among familiar surroundings that are comfortable?
What Is Medical or Skilled Care?
Medical home care or “skilled care” is usually prescribed by a doctor after an injury or hospital stay. Home healthcare is provided by licensed registered nurses RNs, licensed practical nurses (LPNs), Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVNs), physical therapists, occupational therapists or physician assistants. These professionals can administer medications, insert catheters, and provide wound care.
Both medical and non-medical providers are either licensed or certified and both
focus on one thing: helping clients get stronger, safely.
Who Pays For Medical Versus Non Medical Care?
Medicare, Medigap, Managed Care Medicaid, and private pay absorb the costs of skilled
care. Non medical care is usually paid for privately or is covered by a portion of Veteran’s benefits or some medical and long term care insurance. On occasion, some healthcare insurance plans offer limited respite care, which is care while the family is away and usually consists of 80- hours/year. Skilled care is usually temporary, whereas home care can go on indefinitely on a short or long term basis.
Here’s a chart which better explains the differences:
|Medical|
Care
|Non-Medical|
Care
|Duration||Usually temporary||Can be short or long term|
|Staff||LPNs, LVNs, RNs, physical therapists, occupational|
therapists.
|Caregivers, certified nursing aides|

medication changes, ostomy, injections, tracheotomy

499,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/now-hiring-companion-caregivers/,"At FirstLight® Home Care, companion care is a big part of what we do. Companion care helps to give the clients we serve emotional support, comfort and conversation, along with practical assistance around the house, so they can live independently. We’re hiring companion caregivers to provide this level of care to our many clients, and we are always on the lookout for strong candidates.
If you are interested, here’s what you need to know about joining our team.
What Do Companion Caregivers Do?
When a family member notices an aging or disabled loved one is missing meals, letting their food expire, having trouble with housework or dealing with loneliness and depression, companion care can help. It includes a range of different non-medical support services.
As a companion caregiver, you may be responsible for performing the following.
Providing Emotional & Social Support
Isolation and loneliness are extremely common among older adults. Concerned families hire companion caregivers to help alleviate some of the issues related to isolation, providing their loved one with someone who can offer companionship, conversation and comfort. This can include anything from simply sitting and chatting to playing games or taking a client out to visit a friend or family member.
Handling Light Housekeeping Tasks
In addition to being a source of friendship and support, companion caregivers also handle light housekeeping chores, such as laundry, dusting, sweeping and washing dishes or cleaning up after meals. This ensures those individuals who have issues with mobility don’t get overwhelmed by housekeeping tasks.
Preparing Nutritious Meals
Another part of your job if hired as a companion caregiver is preparing healthy meals, including meal planning, grocery shopping and meal preparation. It can also include helping a client follow a prescribed diet, such as low-sodium or low-sugar.
Providing Transportation
If your client has an appointment with their doctor, you might be asked to transport and assist them in navigating their way through the medical office. Companion caregivers can also help with running errands, like going to the post office and picking up prescriptions.
Communicating With Families
In addition to the above responsibilities, another aspect of the job is monitoring your client and notifying their family members if you see any new issues arise related to their well-being or safety. If the individual you’re caring for starts to change their behavior or isn’t eating, for instance, it’s up to you to communicate that to those involved in their care to ensure they’re able to get the medical attention they need.
Over time, you’ll become a friend and confidant who boosts their mood and quality of life. They’ll also have the extra help they need, wherever they call home, so they remain comfortable and safe.
We’re Hiring Companion Caregivers!
FirstLight Home Care is dedicated to hiring the kind of companion caregivers we would trust with our own families. We’re currently searching for compassionate and committed companion caregivers who want to make a difference in the lives of others. For the kinds of people we’re looking for, caring is a calling and a way of life, not just another job.
When we find these exceptional individuals, we take excellent care of them because they are truly the heart and soul of our home care company. Each day, they help us live out our mission of providing top-quality home care services, including companion care, to our many clients who depend on us. This enables those we serve to live life with more independence, joy and comfort.
If you’re interested in getting hired as a companion caregiver with our team, we will provide you with comprehensive paid training. We also have a system for providing feedback and additional learning, so you’ll feel supported and confident when caring for clients.
In addition, we also offer:
- Flexible schedules
- Rewards and recognition programs
- A fun, supportive and safe working environment
- Exceptional support team
When you work at FirstLight Home Care, you’ll have the opportunity to do something that matters. Each day, when you go to work, you’ll be making a positive difference in ways, large and small. You’ll be a partner, a listener, a problem solver, an organizer and so much more. Most importantly, though, you’ll be that person our clients can count on where and when they need help and support.
We’re hiring companion caregivers across many locations. Contact your local FirstLight Home Care today to learn more about our openings and opportunities."
500,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/now-i-know-my-abcs/,"And no, we’re not talking about the alphabet! Many seniors and older adults don’t realize the importance of getting the proper amount of essential vitamins on a daily basis. Did you know that 2/3 of older people admitted to hospitals are undernourished? The elderly are at an especially high risk of malnutrition for reasons such as lack of appetite which can be a result of medications or disability and also reduced food intake because of certain medical conditions. Sometimes, a healthy, balanced diet isn’t enough—vitamin/mineral supplements become necessary as we age. Here’s a brief rundown on some of the most important vitamins aging bodies need to stay nourished, courtesy of the Vitamins & Nutrition Center:
Vitamin D: This is necessary for calcium absorption—the two work in harmony to maintain healthy bones and prevent bone mass loss. They also keep the nervous system healthy and boost the immune system. The elderly are especially susceptible to having brittle bones which can result in serious fractures or broken limbs if/when they fall.
Vitamin K: A common deficiency in the elderly, vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and enhancing bone density—it is often a supplement for people at risk for osteoporosis. Research is currently being done to investigate the link between vitamin K deficiency and if it is a contributing factor to the development of Alzheimer’s.
Antioxidants: Vitamins A, C, and E are well-known antioxidants—defenders against free radicals, which destroy our bodies’ good cells and are linked to diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, AIDS, cancer, premature aging, stroke, kidney and liver disorders and many other detrimental health issues.
Taking a good multi-vitamin as we age is important. Before starting any nutritional supplement, consult your doctor who can tell you the proper dosage. More information on nutrition for the elderly can be found here:"
501,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/nutrition-aging-eating-healthy-mind-body/,"For older adults, the benefits of good nutrition are endless. Healthy eating can improve memory, increase energy levels, strengthen the immune system, speed up recuperation, help manage chronic health problems and more. But nutrient deficiencies and malnutrition are not uncommon among seniors. March is National Nutrition Month, an opportunity to emphasize the importance of a well-balanced diet for healthy aging.
Nutritional Needs as We Age
As we age, our nutritional requirements change. The body’s daily energy needs slowly decrease, so fewer calories are necessary to fuel the body than when we were younger. The impact of our eating habits shift, as well. Natural hormone changes make the body prone to depositing more fat, especially around the middle, and can stagnate muscle building. Bones lose mineral content more rapidly than before, and plaque buildup can naturally occur in the arteries. A healthy diet, combined with moderate physical activity, can help maintain a healthy weight and slow the effects of aging. And researchers are now also making links between nutrition and memory, giving us yet another reason to start making healthy improvements in our eating habits, one forkful at a time.
Start with Your Heart
Research shows that what’s good for your heart is also good for your brain and the rest of your body. The goal of a heart-healthy diet is to help maintain healthy levels of cholesterol and fatty molecules called lipids. The University of Maryland Medical Center says you can achieve this by:
- Reducing low-density lipoproteins (LDL), or “bad” cholesterol. Do this by consuming more fiber and omega-3 fatty acids.
- Increasing high-density lipoproteins (HDL), or “good” cholesterol. Do this by avoiding trans fats and alcohol.
- Reducing other harmful lipids (fatty molecules), such as triglycerides. Do this by limiting sweets and refined carbohydrates.
Make Smart Choices
The optimal eating plan varies depending on age, weight, health status and level of physical activity. But for everyone, a balanced diet should contain the following:
High-fiber foods, such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains and nuts. If you’re not eating enough fruits and vegetables, you’re not alone. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 21 percent of adults eat the recommended amount of fruits each day, and only 33 percent consume the daily recommended servings of vegetables.
Low/fat-free dairy products. As you decrease the fat in dairy, you also cut calories, saturated fat and cholesterol, while protein, calcium and most other vitamins and minerals remain high.
Lean meats and fish. Add seafood, lean meats, poultry, beans, eggs and unsalted nuts for protein, which helps build muscle mass.
Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, considered “essential” fats because they help build healthy cells and maintain brain and nerve function. They’ve also been found to lower blood pressure and heart rate, as well as improve blood vessel function. Omega-3 fatty acids can be found in oily fish such as salmon, tuna and mackerel, as well as vegetable oils, walnuts, leafy greens and flax seeds. Omega-6 fatty acids are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, safflower, corn and soybean, as well as nuts and seeds.
Set Healthy Limits
When it comes to healthy eating, what you don’t put in your body is as important as what you put into it. Setting some healthy limits will help you reach your dietary goals.
Control your portion size. How much you eat is just as important as what you eat. Use smaller plates to help limit portion sizes and be mindful of serving sizes. For example, one serving of pasta is 1/2 cup, or about the size of a hockey puck. A 3-ounce serving of meat, fish or chicken is about the size of a deck of cards.
Limit sodium. About 90 percent of Americans eat more sodium than is recommended for a healthy diet. Try to limit sodium intake to less than 1,500 milligrams a day. This target is especially important for people middle-aged or older, African-Americans and those with high blood pressure.
Avoid saturated and trans fats and cholesterol. Limit your consumption of red meat, whole-fat dairy products, shellfish and egg yolks.
Steer clear of nutrient-poor foods and added sugars. High-calorie, processed foods often have little nutritional value, especially sugar-filled beverages like sodas. Empty calories can lead to weight gain, putting us at higher risk of heart disease.
Limit alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can raise the levels of triglycerides in the blood. It also can lead to high blood pressure, heart failure and an increased calorie intake.
Supporting your pursuit of a more nutritious diet.
If you or a loved one needs help shopping for or preparing healthy meals, FirstLight can help. Through our Companion Care Services, our caregivers can prepare regular meals that help you maintain a healthy diet, provide sufficient nutrition for the application of medicines, and simply add joy and comfort to your day.

503,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/opening-the-conversation-on-care/,"Molly Rowe owns FirstLight Home Care of Salem, MA with her husband, Steve, and lives in Swampscott with their two sons.
A few weeks ago, I wrote about our regrets related to my father-in-law in the last few years of his life. Since then, I’ve heard many stories from people who’ve shared similar experiences caring for an aging parent or loved one. Every story is different of course, but there’s one sentence I keep hearing over and over: “Looking back, we should have had help.”
It’s mind-boggling to me, really, that we are all in this “caring for our parent” boat at one time or another, and yet no one knows how to row. One of our caregivers said the same thing to me last week as she spoke of her dad, who died of cancer, and how she and her mom took turns caring for him. Between the two of them, they were able to care for him 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but she, too, says, “Looking back, we should have had help.”
We say it, too, but starting the conversation about getting help just seemed too overwhelming at the time. How do you suggest to your parents that they allow a stranger into their house or that they move to assisted living? It’s not easy, we know, but we now know there are ways to approach it.
Ask questions. Don’t start with the words, “You need home care” or “You need to sell your house.” Start the conversation by asking questions: Do you wish you had help with something small, like meal preparation, grocery shopping or house cleaning? Do you feel safe in your home? Do you ever feel lonely? And then really listen to the answers. Your loved one might have needs or worries you didn’t even know about, and if you listen to them, they might be willing to work with you to come up with solutions.
Start small. Propose that they start with a meal service or a home-care visit of just a few hours a week, where the caregiver does laundry or light housekeeping while building rapport. Then, let your mom or dad decide if it’s helping and if they want more care — or none at all. Maybe the help they need is much bigger than a few hours each week, but starting small might make them see that without your forcing it on them.
Empower. A lot of the objections we hear don’t have as much to do with a person not wanting help as they do with a person not wanting to lose their independence. We tell families to let their loved ones be in control by involving them in the decision of what type of care they’ll get, the initial meetings with the caregivers and how often they’ll get care (e.g., every night between 6 and 9 p.m.).
Sometimes, “help” comes in different forms. As I write this, I know none of these approaches would have worked with my father-in-law. He never would have agreed to a caregiver in his home — even once a week — and certainly wouldn’t have moved. But one thing I think he would have agreed to was a personal emergency response system — one of those pendants where he could push a button if he fell or needed help. (This simple tool might have saved his life, actually, since he was home alone when he died.)
If you think the bigger care conversations won’t work, start the conversation here — with an in-home monitoring device to monitor medications, sense if they’ve fallen or even track their whereabouts if they lose their way.
I’m not going to say opening the conversation on care is easy — it’s not — but there are ways to do it that will actually empower your loved one rather than strip away their independence. You’ll both sleep better at night, and in the end, instead of looking back, saying, “We should have had help,” you’ll be able to say, “Thank God we asked for help.”

504,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/oral-health-and-aging/,"Your oral health can be impacted as you age. Crowns and veneers do not last forever. Gums may recede, and tooth loss may require partial dentures, bridges or implants. No matter your age, it’s never too late to improve your oral care and work with your dentist to positively impact your overall health.
A regular dental care routine and relationship with your dentist will help you understand the changes occurring with your oral health. Here are some things that you should know about your oral health and aging:
- Older adults are more prone to cavities and decay on the root surfaces of their teeth. Visiting your dentist on a regular basis, along with normal oral health routines, like brushing and flossing, can help prevent this.
- Sensitive teeth and receding gums are common issues and only increase with age. As your gums begin to recede, the areas of your teeth that do not have enamel start to become exposed, leaving them prone to sensitivity. Brushing with sensitive toothpaste can help, along with seeing your dentist.
- Medical conditions and medications can impact your teeth dramatically. One of the more common issues is dry mouth, which means less moisture is produced in your mouth, leaving it less cleansed and protected. Your dentist can recommend treatments and medications to assist with dry mouth that can help restore saliva production.
- People over the age of 40 are at a higher risk for gum disease (Sources: ADA). Many things can increase the progression of gum disease: poor oral hygiene, a bad diet, stress, diseases like diabetes and cancer, medications and personal choices such as smoking.
- Always let your dentist know about existing medical conditions you have. Common senior health conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and even cancer can affect oral health. When your dentist understands your medical conditions, he or she can better recommend treatments and care for your oral health.
By maintaining healthy oral habits at home, making smart choices about diet and lifestyle, and seeking regular dental care, you can help your teeth last a lifetime—whether you have your natural teeth, implants or wear dentures.
You can learn more about oral concerns in adults over the age of 60, such as the link between medications and cavities, gum disease and mouth cancer from the American Dental Association.
FirstLight Home Care provides a variety of personal care services and aid to assist with hygiene activities, including oral health. Contact FirstLight Home Care today to learn more about our Personal Care and other home care services."
505,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/oral-health-care-for-the-elderly/,"A recent visit to the dentist left me thinking about the issue of oral health care for the elderly. A report on the oral health of older Americans noted that dental care is a luxury many of the seniors in our society can’t afford; a whopping 20 percent of Americans age 75 and older lack any form of dental insurance. Additionally, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, about 23 percent of people between the ages of 65 and 74 have severe periodontal disease.
Poor oral health in the elderly can lead to inadequate diet, malnutrition, inadequate oral hygiene due to poor dexterity or limited mobility, compromised chewing and functioning abilities, lowered self-esteem, and social isolation. What can we do to help prevent this from happening? Many prominent oral health professionals advocate the establishment of formal health care programs in long-term care facilities and nursing homes. Caregivers should also be trained to help patients with daily tooth-brushing, fluoride rinses and flossing.
When choosing a professional caregiver or researching nursing home or assisted living options, be sure to ask if any specific programs are in place to ensure your elderly loved one’s oral health."
506,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/organization-write-things-down/,"Life gets busy and we are inundated with a ton of noise coming from our cell phones, emails, text messages, videos, TV and more. When things get hectic, we can tend to get forgetful. A simple but powerful habit to get into your daily routine is to write things down. Why is it so important you ask?
Time has a way of changing our memory: Writing things down as they happen or right after they happen will help you to memorialize the facts. Every time we remember something, we recreate what happened and each time we do this things change. Your perception is your reality and therefore other people might remember something completely different than what you do. We need some kind of system outside of ourselves to help us remember what really happened – writing it down is that system.
Good things don’t last long: Have you ever had a brilliant idea in the middle of the night and by morning you can’t remember it? Ideas can pop up at the strangest times but they tend to not stay for long in your head. So you need to capture them fast. Keep a journal with you (or by your bed) and when the idea comes up, jot it down.
Writing down your goals can make a big difference: Ask any successful person about how they set goals and they will tell you that they write them down. Written goals bring clarity and focus, not to mention accountability. A written goal will give you a set path and focus. You can return to these goals each week, month, or year to see where you at to achieving.
Streamline your thoughts: Too many ideas running through your head is not a good thing. Take time to list out the tasks or ideas taking space in your head and purge this information out. Creating a list of action items or issues to address will help you to clear your head and improve your thinking so that you can solve the task or problem and get back on track to achieving the goal.
Keeps you focused: We get busy. Life happens. Business has a crisis. Each and every day we are bombarded with unexpected things and if we don’t write things down – such as a goal or an idea – we will lose track of what is most important. Write your goal in a place you will see daily. When the pressures of life start to mount, look at your goal and get yourself back on track"

So at FirstLight Home Care, we’d like to share with you some stories where teens can learn from senior citizens and vice versa. Maybe it will inspire you to start an
intergenerational program in your area!
Think about it. Many senior citizens have trouble with their mobile devices and computers. What better person to teach them than a teenager who is never far away from their favorite technological gadget? Teenagers can text faster than most of us can talk! Many cities across the United States have programs where teenagers can get class credit for helping seniors with their computers. How great is that?
Or how about People Helping People, a volunteer program run by the Duarte Teen Center in California? Teenagers help seniors with errands, lawn work and enjoy long chats over lunch. Too often in our busy lives, we don’t take the time to really listen to a teenager’s concerns. The senior citizens take the time to listen and offer advice. And because the advice is coming from someone other than their parents, it is often welcomed!
Think about it … there is much about “been there done that” that teenagers can learn from seniors. In fact, the idea that teens and seniors can help each other also drives the Elder
Wisdom Circle, a national organization based in Walnut Creek, CA. Founded in 2001, the program uses technology to connect younger people who seek advice and inspiration with older people who can share the benefits of their experience. In September 2006, some 600 senior volunteers responded to 3,500 requests for advice submitted anonymously at www.elderwisdomcircle.org. The “Dear Abby” of the older generation!
Senior centers and elementary schools in Berkeley have also participated in an intergenerational exchange program. Once or twice every week, the school kids practice their language and reading skills on seniors at the North Berkeley Senior Center by reading stories aloud. And once a week, as many as three dozen senior volunteers travel into classrooms around Berkeley, ready to help children improve their reading and
language skills.
In fact, whole communities are being built around seniors and teenagers helping each other. The premise is that seniors can help earn a little money while babysitting, whereas working families will feel more comfortable with a babysitter who they know. In fact, this is exactly what The Related Companies did when they built The Windsor Court which contains one apartment complex for seniors and one for family’s side-by-side. “It helps keep seniors youthful to be with younger people, and it gives younger people an appreciation of the value that older people bring to life, with their experience and knowledge and worldly wisdom” says Don Anderson, community development director for the City of Westminster.
Or many seniors have problems getting outside, but miss the images found only in nature. That’s exactly what the Huntington-Oyster Bay Audubon Society (“HOBAS”) had in mind when developing its program called “Connecting Teens and Seniors, Bridging the Generation Gap Through Nature”. The HOBAS Youth Outreach Committee (“YOC”) visits nursing homes to present programs on birds in order to help re-connect seniors to the natural world. Pairing teenagers with seniors through nature education builds mutual respect between generations.
Do you have a great idea for a multigenerational program? At FirstLight Home Care, we’d love to hear about it!"
509,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/parenting-an-aging-parent/,"As our society ages, the children of older parents are faced with the fact that they may have to care for Mom, Dad, or both as they enter their later years, which reverses the traditional parent/child roles each has known all or most of their lives.
Caregivers often face other challenges when parenting an aging parent, such as having to step in and advise them when to take medication, when to purge expired food, or even when to take away the car keys. This role reversal is sometimes shocking to both the children and the parents and can result in friction. The parents have been adults for decades now and may resent their child making decisions for them, while the child can sometimes find it hard to “parent” their parent.
Adult children should consider several things before making the decision to care for their aging parents in their home:
Keep the lines of communication open
Older parents may find it difficult and embarrassing to ask for assistance from their own children. What once was a simple task is no longer easy, and the frustration in the inability to manage the chore can make the parent angry or depressed. At other times, the parent may not remember to take their medication, or they refuse to take it because they are upset at being told to do so. In these cases, the adult children need to take some time to explain why these things are necessary.
For example, explaining calmly to the parent that they could injure themselves in the bath without assistance or that their medication needs to be taken so they can continue to spend time with their loved ones can avoid hurt feelings and put the onus on the parent to take responsibility for their own actions.
Allow yourself to “mourn” the loss of the traditional roles
While the parent has not passed away, their role as the elder leader has diminished. This can cause a sense of loss in the adult child that is as strong as the loss of a parent. Take time to mourn the role reversal and allow yourself to grieve in the process. Seek out other adult children who are experiencing the same changes in their relationships with their parents and discuss these feelings of loss and chaos.
Get support
Adult children who care for their parents should maintain relationships with others who are in similar situations. Finding a support group or even another family who understands how difficult it is to transition from the role of child to “parent” helps. Offering each other advice and tips on care can ease the burden of such a major change.
Family caregivers should also set time aside for themselves. Asking another family member or hiring a professional caregiver to come in on occasion gives the adult child time for self-care. Sometimes recharging one’s batteries is necessary for good mental health.
Don’t set unreasonable expectations
Because many adult children are new in their roles as caregiver, they may not realize that some of the frustration they feel and the disappointment they see in their parents are because they have set their expectations too high. Realize that the parent is no longer mobile and may have aging issues that have reduced their ability to make even minor decisions and adjust accordingly. Consult the parent’s doctors to determine the limits of their abilities and recognize that sometimes letting go also applies to one’s own expectations.
Another thing to remember is that your parent is not a child. Don’t give them orders unless their life is in danger. If possible, include them in any decision-making.
Set boundaries
If there are tasks that the adult child or the parent is uncomfortable performing together, like bathing, for example, it may be time to seek outside help just for those chores. If that is not an option, many senior groups and community organizations provide training and tips on how to overcome embarrassments that arise when the adult child must assist in the bathroom.
Also, remember that order and routine are comforting to people who are undergoing big changes in their lives. Setting a daily schedule and keeping to it as much as possible will help in the transition. The parent knows what to expect and the adult child can prepare for daily events.
Parenting an aging parent is sometimes part of the aging process. If an adult child decides he or she must become a parent’s caregiver, spending time educating themselves about the resources they will need makes the transition smoother. Don’t be afraid to ask for help.
Caregiving for a parent is certainly a challenge, but it can also be joyful. Time spent together and building a bond over new roles can strengthen the parent/child relationship for years to come."
510,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/parkinsons-disease-myths-misconceptions/,"April is Parkinson’s Awareness Month.
There are many myths and misconceptions about Parkinson’s Disease and FirstLIght Home Care is here to set things straight. During the month of April, our caregivers at FirstLight Home Care will share information through our social media channels about the disease. Conversations will include living with or caring for someone with Parkinson’s Disease and tips and resources to help you better understand this progressive neurological disorder that affects nearly one million people in the United States.
The first step in understanding Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is to recognize some of the many common misconceptions and myths that don’t truly reflect the reality of the disease.
- Misconception: Only elderly people are diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease
- Reality: The average age of a Parkinson’s Disease diagnosis is 60, there are many people diagnosed younger, and some receive a diagnosis before age 40
- Myth: Parkinson’s disease is curable
- Reality: To date, there is no known cure or way to prevent Parkinson’s Disease. But on a positive note, research on PD has made remarkable progress. The science communities are very hopeful that the causes, whether genetic or environmental, will be identified and the precise effects of these causes on brain function will be understood. Even though there is no cure for Parkinson’s disease, by identifying individual symptoms and determining a proper course of treatment, most people with the disease can live enjoyable, fulfilling lives.
- Misconception: Tremors are the only symptom of Parkinson’s Disease
- Tremors are probably the most recognized symptom of Parkinson’s Disease; many Parkinson’s patients do not have tremors but have rigidity and slow movements. Up to thirty percent of patients do not have tremors at the onset of the disease. And, for others, tremors can be caused by many other conditions.
- Myth: Parkinson’s Disease is caused by genetics
- Reality: Currently there is no known cause. Scientists and doctors are studying both environmental and genetic factors and their impact on PD and their research currently suggests that less than 10 percent of Parkinson’s Disease cases have a true genetic link.
- Misconception: People diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease do not live a quality life
- Reality: There are many actions a person living with Parkinson’s disease can do to help maintain a quality and active life. Exercise, as part of your daily program, may help improve balance issues and motor coordination. It can also have an impact on mood, fatigue and other non-motor Parkinson’s symptoms. Finding the right medical personnel is important. Working with a movement disorder specialist, a neurologist with additional training in Parkinson’s or Physical therapists will help the person with PD. We also , nutritionists and other professional caregivers can help you design a treatment plan and daily care programs that will help you live better with Parkinson’s.
Join FirstLight Home Care Parkinson’s Disease conversations happening on our Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ social channels. If you have specific PD questions or would like to know more on how FirstLight Home Care can support you or your family member diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease, please contact us online or at (866) 985-4031."
511,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/pay-home-care-life-insurance/,"For many hard-working adults, taking care of a loved one in need can be complicated and time consuming, often requiring the aid of a trained caregiver. Whether it’s for chronic pain sufferers, aging parents or family members recovering from an injury, in-home care is a worthy investment that unfortunately for some, simply isn’t in their budget.
At FirstLight Home Care, we never want the care of your loved ones to cause financial hardship. For these instances, life insurance can often be used to pay for in-home senior and adult care. Here are a few things to know to get the financial assistance you need to extend a culture of care to your family.
- Qualifications: Converting life insurance to what’s called a long-term care benefit plan is an option that all in-force life insurance types offer. These include term, whole, group and even universal insurance. Immediate need for care is a requirement that’s likely to be determined by the insurance provider.
- Costs: Many providers offer this conversion at no additional cost. In fact, when most policies are switched, the subsidies begin helping immediately with no extra premiums and payments going directly to the care provider.
- Payouts: Payouts for caregiving vary based on your life insurance policy and the number of months help is needed. Because the payouts are private pay, the money can be used for any type of caregiving, from assisted living to in-home care.
- Funeral costs: You may think that converting a life insurance policy to pay for in-home care would eliminate the funeral cost savings, but that isn’t the case. While the ultimate payout may be smaller, you’ll still receive a portion of your account to cover funeral expenses – typically $5,000.
Paying for the care your loved ones both need and want can be tricky, but life insurance is designed to help. Most long-term care benefit plans are accessible at any time and are even recognized by Medicaid as a qualified financial vehicle. If you want to learn more about paying for high-quality in-home care using life insurance, contact your local FirstLight Home Care location to find out how to get started."
512,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/personal-or-companion-care-which-is-better/,"“Sometimes asking for help is the most meaningful example of self-reliance.”— Unknown
If you are caring for a loved one, whether it’s an aging parent who needs help around the home or a family member with a disability, there may come a time when you – as the family caregiver – need an extra helping hand with personal and companion care.
Enlisting the help of non-medical home care and hiring a caregiver to deliver personal and companion care services can be the next step in providing respite and peace of mind for you. But home care can include such a wide range of services, it can be difficult to know which is truly needed and which is best for you and your loved one.
Does your loved one need general help around the house, such as grocery shopping and meal planning, or simple companionship? Or do they need more hands-on assistance like bathing and dressing?
In this piece, Choosing Personal and Companion Care for Loved Ones, our Co-Founder and CEO, Jeff Bevis, talks about the differences between personal and companion care and how to choose the right one. Jeff has been a family caregiver four different times in his life, and he has always been focused on improving the quality of life of others.
This article originally appeared on Forbes.com. Jeff is a regular contributor to the publication, offering advice, insight and often a glimpse into his personal experiences with home care, senior care and family caregiving.
At FirstLight Home Care, we provide non-medical in-home care that covers everything from household duties like cooking, cleaning, and laundry to individual needs such as bathing and hygiene and mobility assistance.
If you’re not sure where to start, give us a call so that we can learn more about your needs for personal and companion care services."
513,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/personal-stories-personal-care/,"More than 20 years ago, Kim Motter remembers when her grandmother, Olivia, could no longer live independently in her home after suffering from a severe fall. Kim remembers how at the time, in-home care options were limited. Nursing homes were really the only viable care option for her family, who lived some 250 miles away from her ailing grandmother.
Today, times are different. Kim, who recently opened a FirstLight Home Care business with her partner Liza M. Burns in Dayton, Ohio, never forgot Olivia’s story. Its lasting impact carried over into a mission of providing in-home care for those who need it most.
On Aug. 1, the two opened only the second FirstLight Home Care business and are serving residents in Montgomery, Warren and Butler counties.
Like Kim, Liza’s personal experiences have impacted her decision to make a difference in the homecare industry after recently experiencing a stroke. Liza, now 31, suffered short term symptoms including muscle weakness, loss of speech, light sensitivity, memory loss and migraines. Simultaneously, Liza realized how much care was needed when her grandmother suffered a series of debilitating strokes.
I was fortunate enough to talk to Liza about her two-fold challenges earlier this week.
“My experiences have helped me reevaluate the need for in-home care services,” she told me on her decision to go into business. The two look to cultivate a culture of care with the help of a staff that provides exceptional services based on education and wellness.
Like Kim, Liza also cultivated a close relationship with her grandparents.
“Quality of life and care depends on an extraordinary team that can ensure an undeniable level of integrity,” she told me. “We are committed to building a team of caregivers we would trust in providing care for our own families.”
In addition to tying their passionate pursuits with their personal stories, Kim and Liza bring nearly a combined 30 years of sales and marketing experience to their new roles. They expect to grow their business by adding at least 10 caregivers by the end of the year.
As president and CEO of FirstLight Home Care, I am certainly excited to bring our newest team on board—and even more excited for the growth opportunities ahead. In the coming weeks we’ll be introducing our next franchisee—who has a personal care story of his own to share.
Until then . . . Enjoy the weekend with your loved ones."
514,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/personalizing-amazon-alexa-for-seniors/,"Amazon Alexa just may be the perfect digital device for your loved one. Seniors can talk to Alexa just as they would a normal person and ask it for a wide range of services. As a holistic resource, Alexa can become an integral part of your senior’s daily routine.
However, setting up Alexa for your loved one can take time. It’s not always clear how to integrate accounts and set up apps for Alexa. Let’s go over key aspects of personalizing Amazon Alexa for seniors so your loved one can make the most of it.
Challenges of personalizing Amazon Alexa for seniors
Given the depth of services Alexa provides, set-up can be fairly involved. It’s important to guide your loved one through this process. Especially at the start, be sure you’re available to help them learn Alexa skills and answer any questions.
Start by setting up their Amazon account. This way, Alexa can easily integrate with all Amazon services down the road. You only need an email to get started.
You might also consider printing off a list of Alexa commands. While it may be obvious to you how to ask Alexa certain things, seniors may not feel comfortable with voice-activated technology at first. Create a “cheat sheet” so they feel comfortable asking about the weather, playing music and even calling you. Later on, they’ll likely not need this sheet.
You should also pay special attention to the volume control so that your loved one can communicate with and understand Alexa in the long run.
Essential set-up for personalizing Amazon Alexa for seniors
First things first: you’ll want to set up Alexa with essential services. You can preconfigure many of these items, so that your senior doesn’t need to worry about set-up.
- Set up phone contacts so your loved one can call you via Alexa.
- Save their address for ordering Uber rides or getting food delivery.
- Create medication reminders that your loved one might not remember.
- If your loved one has smart house apps, you can integrate them into Alexa, including lights, thermostat, TV, security cameras and house locks.
- My Life Story feature for seniors with dementia allows you to save “memories” that your loved one can play back.
Entertainment set-up for personalizing Amazon Alexa for seniors
Next, it’s time to set up the fun stuff! Most entertainment set-up can be preconfigured as favorites in Alexa. Basically, just ask Alexa via voice to “link” your accounts and services for a seamless experience.
- Integrate your loved one’s favorite entertainment apps, including music, radio, audio books, sport matches and trivia shows.
- Set favorites for weather, traffic and news.
- Set favorites for other areas of interests, such as bible passages, exercise programs and shopping apps.
Alexa is an excellent way to boost your caregiving abilities from a distance. With it, seniors feel secure, are entertained, and they get answers to any questions. It’s also a friendly tool for those with dementia or immobility. With voice-activated commands, seniors don’t have to strain arthritis joints or their vision either.
Personalizing Amazon Alexa for seniors will ensure that your loved one has everything right at his or her fingertips. Remember, when in doubt, simply check out Amazon’s Alexa Guide for in-depth steps.
Caregiving can be challenging. My Caring Plan has a list of resources to help guide you through the questions you may have. Resources include financial, legal and health information.

516,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/positive-attitude-and-caregiving/,"Maintaining a positive attitude as a family caregiver can be difficult, especially when the role becomes overwhelming. Staying optimistic can help family caregivers cope, reduce stress and make it easier to get through the tough days.
Here are some tips we often provide to our FirstLight Home Care caregivers to help them keep their amazing, positive attitudes. These may also help you – the family caregiver – to remain
confident, hopeful, and encouraged when it comes to your own personal caregiving responsibilities.
Learn healthy ways to manage your stress: Stress happens when you believe the demands placed on you – anything from work to family to caregiving – exceed your ability to cope. Managing your stress can make a world of difference. Taking breaks, exercising, getting together with friends and asking for help are simple ways you can reduce your stress level and maintain your positive attitude.
Eat right and get plenty of rest: Your diet and nutrition choices can make your stress levels go up or down. Certain foods, like spinach, salmon, blueberries, and almonds provide comfort and increase levels of hormones in the body that naturally fight stress. Pre-plan and prepare your meals in advance to avoid stressing over what to make for dinner and to avoid filling up on fast food.
Sleep and mood are closely connected. Poor or inadequate sleep can cause irritability and tension. Make sleep a priority for you and the family members in your care. Start early in the evening by turning off distractions such as the television, computer, and mobile devices. You also can dim the lights to get everyone relaxed and ready for bedtime.
Exercise: Carve out time each day – even if it’s just 30 minutes to an hour – to walk around the neighborhood, hike in the park, do yoga at a local gym or whatever physical activity you enjoy. Exercise and other physical activity produce endorphins—chemicals in the brain that act as natural painkillers. Plus, exercising can support weight loss and improve your ability to sleep, which in turn reduces stress.
Laugh: Find the joy and humor in your daily life. Laughter is known to decrease stress hormones and increase immune cells and infection-fighting antibodies, improving your resistance to disease. Laughter triggers the release of endorphins, the body’s natural feel-good chemicals, which can promote an overall sense of well-being.
Find time to relax: Caregiving for a family member can be a 24/7 job, so finding time during a typical week for guilt-free relaxation is important. You will be a better caregiver if you can take a step away from caring for someone else so that you can care for yourself for a while. Ask other family members to step in and help, even if it’s for a few hours on a Saturday afternoon.
If that is not possible, find a solution like FirstLight Home Care to help support you. We provide in-home care services such as companion care, personal care, and respite care. We deliver the personalized care services and elder care solutions at home or any setting for a couple of hours, an entire day, or even longer-term if needed to support your family member and you.

517,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/preparing-a-holiday-dinner-for-someone-with-diabetes/,"Finding out you are diabetic does require a change of lifestyle. The food plan
diabetics need isn’t so much a nutritional food plan specific to those with
diabetes; it is the recommended food plan for everyone, including low calories,
smaller serving sizes, low in fat, and high in nutrients…this is simply a
healthy eating plan. One component that may be more specific to those with diabetes, is the limit of carbohydrates; however, this is also something we recommend for all. With that said, planning a holiday meal for someone with diabetes shouldn’t be an added stress. Simply try to create a meal plan that is healthy for all. There are two easy steps to making sure you are on the right track when providing this meal:
- Get the facts straight. It is a great idea to become aware of the myths and facts about the diet of a diabetic. Make sure to take the time to become informed. You can find great information at http://www.helpguide.org/life/healthy_diet_diabetes.htm as well as other related sites.
- Find a Holiday Menu. There are so many food websites that create full diabetic friendly holiday food menus.Make life that much easier by using recipes that are already put together for this purpose. Sign up for a holiday meal plan as well as helpful information about healthy eating at http://www.diabetes.org/mfa-recipes/log-in/register-for-myfood-advisor.html
Holidays are a time for fun! Enjoy the food, but most importantly, the people around you and never lose sight of your diabetes care. Especially if those around you are limited by food choice, it is essential to not make your holiday party all about the food. Include fun games and conversation to keep the party alive!"
518,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/preparing-your-parents-for-the-flu-season/,"Preparing for the flu season is vital to the health of your aging parents. It’s no secret that the elderly are more susceptible to catching the flu virus, so each year it is important to take the proper precautions to keep your parents healthy. This year, the flu season has started early and appears to be strong, according to the CDC. In order to keep your parents healthy this year, make sure you take the following precautions.
Get Vaccinated
The first step to prepare for the upcoming flu season is to get your parents vaccinated. Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent catching the flu and is available to aging adults. Not only will the vaccination help keep your parents from getting the flu, but it will also prevent them from spreading the disease to those around them, including their spouse, grandchildren, and friends. If your parents are worried they might catch the flu from the vaccination, tell them not to worry. According to the CDC, you cannot catch the flu from the vaccination, as the influenza viruses in flu shots are inactive. Also, make sure your parents get vaccinated as soon as possible. Any one over the age of 50 is at a higher risk to get the flu, and the vaccine usually takes two weeks to set in.
Other Tips to Avoid the Flu
In addition to getting a flu vaccination, there are plenty of additional steps that your parents can take to avoid catching the flu this year. Each day, make sure your parents
take the precautions below in order to stay healthy this flu season.
– Wash your hands often, especially in high-risk environments like public places
– Avoid touching your face, especially your eyes, mouth, and nose
– Get plenty of rest
– Drink lots of fluids throughout the day
– Avoid others who are sick or may be getting sick
– Turn your head and cover your mouth with your elbow when you cough or sneeze
– Eat immune system boosting foods that contain antioxidants
– Include plenty of vitamins like vitamin c in your diet
– Get exercise each day
– Routinely clean and disinfect surfaces throughout your home
Looking for additional resources? Check out the CDC website which is filled with great information about the flu and flu prevention."
519,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/prevent-caregiver-burnout/,"In November, we celebrate National Home Care Month and National Family Caregivers Month, two observances that are core to FirstLight Home Care. Throughout the month, our FirstLight blog will focus on providing the tools, tips, resources and peace of mind so many family caregivers need. We invite you to comment and share the challenges and rewarding experiences you’ve encountered throughout your caregiving journey.
Because family caregiving is emotionally and physically draining, it can lead to caregiver burnout.
For many, taking on the role of family caregiver is unfamiliar territory. While caring for a loved one is a worthwhile responsibility, it also can cause a significant amount of stress, exhaustion and sometimes even health issues. Because caregiving is emotionally and physically draining, it can lead to burnout and possible health issues for you – the family caregiver.
There are ways to help prevent family caregiver burnout, and it begins with recognizing the warning signs. Read about some of the signs to be mindful of, as well as what you can do prevent caregiver burnout.
Possible Warning Signs
Are you a family caregiver who is seeing one or more of these signs in yourself? Take action immediately to prevent caregiver burnout and preserve your health.
- Feeling depressed, anxious or helpless
- Having trouble relaxing, even when you’re not providing care for your loved one
- Losing interest in activities you once enjoyed
- Purposely avoiding family and friends
- Changes in weight (losing or gaining weight)
- Lack of energy or constant exhaustion
- Not taking care of your own health
- Getting sick more often
- Becoming progressively short-tempered with the loved one you are caring for
Keeping It All in Check
There are ways to help reduce, if not prevent, caregiver burnout:
Confide in someone close to you. Talk to a friend you trust, share your feelings of frustration and anger and allow them to listen to you. Remember that it’s normal to have negative feelings about this rewarding responsibility. You could also find a support group in your area to discuss your experiences and connect with others who are in a similar situation and can relate to what you’re going through.
Consider asking for assistance. Accept that you might need caregiving assistance. Don’t be afraid to ask for help from those who can share in the caregiving responsibility. Even if friends or family members cannot step in to help relieve some of the burden and responsibilities, they might be able to provide a different perspective on the situation, offer guidance or advice.
Set aside time for you. Taking care of yourself is a necessity. Prioritize activities you enjoy, even if it’s just for a short period of time. Taking a break to sit and relax or read a book, or getting out of the house to take a short walk can be enough to recharge and regain some energy. It’s also important to focus on your personal relationships by staying in touch with family and friends and spending time with them when you can.
Consider respite care services. Respite care services can offer temporary relief by having a professional caregiver come in and take care of your loved one. It allows you to take time off from your responsibilities as a primary caregiver so that you can focus on yourself. Caregivers are there to make sure your loved one is cared for in a safe, familiar environment while you take a much-needed break.
Maintain your own health. Eating well, exercising and getting plenty of sleep can keep you healthy so that you can better care for your loved one. Also consider daily meditation, which can help relieve stress and keep you relaxed. And don’t forget about your own doctor visits. When you get busy taking care of someone else, you often miss your own check-ups and appointments, which can lead to health issues down the road.
Accept the choice you’ve made. Acknowledge that you made a conscious choice to be a family caregiver, and remember all the positive reasons behind that choice. Recalling these reasons can help get you through some of the most difficult times. And there is no shame in finding ways to applaud yourself and what you’re doing, especially if you’re not getting appreciation from others.

520,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/prevent-falls-in-seniors-with-these-home-safety-tips/,"According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, falls are the most common cause of non-fatal trauma-related hospital admissions among older adults. The facts are alarming:
- Ninety-five percent of the 250,000 hip fractures that occur annually are the result of a fall.
- Every 11 seconds, an older adult is treated in an emergency room due to a fall.
- Every 19 minutes an older adult will die from a fall.
However, falls are often preventable. Our team at FirstLight Home Care has outlined the most common causes of falls in the elderly, as well as what to do to reduce the risk.
Be careful when carrying the load
- Never carry objects that are too heavy or large, making balance difficult.
- When carrying objects, do not allow your vision to be blocked.
- Make more trips with smaller loads.
Wear proper shoes
- Shoes should have low heels and good tread.
- Avoid smooth leather soles or tennis shoes with a smooth bottom.
- Keep shoelaces tied or Velcro firmly fastened.
- Slippers should have rubber soles and should not be worn outside.
Avoid common hazards around the home
- Area Rugs and runners should have a rubberized non-slip backing.
- Patterned rugs can affect depth perception. Solid-colored rugs are less confusing.
- Do not place cords or wires under rugs or runners. Uneven surfaces can cause tripping.
- Use non-slip rubber adhesives under furniture legs to prevent sliding.
- Shelves that are too high can result in a fall from overreaching or from using a chair or ladder.
- Do not use hallways or stairways for storage—keep them free of clutter.
- Tape down torn carpet and/or tack down loose edges.
Be aware of bedroom safety
- The bed should be a comfortable height, stable and firm enough to get in and out of easily.
- A telephone and lamp should be reachable on the bedside table.
- Keep a flashlight on the bedside table for emergencies.
- Eyeglasses, canes, and walkers should be kept within reach.
- Sit when dressing or undressing especially if you are unstable when standing.
Keep the bathroom safe
- Rubberized slip-resistant mats both inside and outside of the shower or tub help prevent slipping.
- Place slip-resistant grab bars inside and outside the shower and tub area and next to the toilet.
- Use a shower bench or chair for someone if unsteady on your feet.
- A raised toilet seat makes it easier and safer for someone who is weak or has balance problems.
Don’t forget proper lighting
- Light switches should be accessible at room entrances and at the beginning of any dark area.
- Always use the suggested maximum wattage (but not to exceed) of the light fixture.
- Consider frosted bulbs to reduce glare.
- Automatic touch lights that tum on when you touch the base of the lamp are helpful for those with arthritis or painful joints. Adapters are available to convert existing lamps into touch-sensitive lamps.
Stairs can also be a hazard
- Stairs should be well lit so that each step is clearly seen, especially the first and last step, the places where most falls occur.
- Check carpeted stairs regularly to make sure that the carpet is securely fastened.
- Do not place loose rugs or runners on the top or bottom of stair landings.
- All stairways, including outside stairs, should have handrails installed at the correct height on both sides.
Remember outdoor safety
- Step edges should be marked with reflective tape that is designed for outdoor use.
- Traction tape on stair treads will minimize the chance of falls when the stairs are wet.
- Use a contrasting color adhesive strip along the edge of the threshold to make it more visible.
- Keep pathways and stairs clean. Leaves, moss, snow, and ice can cause serious falls.
- Paths and sidewalks that are raised and cracked create a hazard.
- Illuminate pathways with exterior lights and light larger areas with spotlights.
- Keep hoses away from pathways and sidewalks.
Medications can contribute to falls
- Some medications can contribute to falls because of side effects such as drowsiness or dizziness.
- Review all medications with the physician or pharmacist to see if there is an increased risk for falls. Some drugs that contribute to falls are diuretics, blood pressure medicine and medications given for psychological reasons.
Walker and wheelchair safety
- When using a walker, both hands must be free to grasp the handles on either side.
- Avoid carrying heavy objects, which could cause a loss of balance or overload a wheelchair.
- Wheelchairs should be checked periodically to make sure they are in good working condition.
- Always raise or remove the foot supports and lock the wheels before transferring.
Emergency alarm systems provide peace of mind
- Personal Emergency Response Systems (PERS) provide emergency help at the press of a button, 24 hours a day.
- The response button is worn around the neck, on the belt or on the wrist.
- These systems help alleviate the fear of being alone during an emergency such as a fall.
At FirstLight, our caregivers are taught to watch for possible fall hazards and to manage them before an accident happens. In addition to home safety checks, our team provides a variety of home care services to help you or your loved one stay safe and independent.

521,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/prevent-type-2-diabetes/,"November is National Diabetes Month and FirstLight Home Care would like to bring your attention to an illness that impacts millions of Americans every day. According to the National Diabetes Association:
- Nearly 26 million children and adults in the United States have diabetes.
- Another 79 million Americans have pre-diabetes and are at risk for developing type 2 diabetes.
The statistic that is most startling is:
- Recent estimates project that as many as 1 in 3 American adults will have diabetes in 2050 unless we take steps to Stop Diabetes.
Although Type 1 diabetes is not preventable, Type 2 diabetes is. For instance, did you know you can be screened for diabetes after 30 if your family history shows you are at risk? Here’s some ways to help you prevent diabetes:
- Weight. A study done by the Harvard School of Public Health and published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that being overweight and obese was the single most important risk factor that predicted who would develop type 2 diabetes. Maintaining a diet that is low in fat and high in fiber can help prevent Type 2 diabetes. If you are more than 20% over your ideal weight, you are a prime candidate for type 2 diabetes.
- Eat your grains and vegetables. Whole grains may reduce your risk of diabetes and help maintain blood sugar levels. Try to make at least half your grains whole grains.
- Exercise. You don’t have to become a marathoner, but moderate exercise – even just 30 minutes/day — has been found to significantly reduce the incidence of Type 2 diabetes. Plus, you’ll be less stressed and feel better.
- Medications. If you fall into a high-risk group for diabetes, there are medications that may help prevent the progression to type 2 diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance.
- Cholesterol. Unhealthy cholesterol levels can raise your risk for type 2 diabetes and heart disease.
- High Blood Pressure. Healthy blood pressure is below 120/80. High blood pressure makes you susceptible to not only diabetes, but heart attack and stroke as well.
Diabetes has reached epic proportions in the last ten years. Taking small steps to change your lifestyle can bring BIG rewards in preventing diabetes."
522,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/preventing-caregiver-blues-during-the-holidays/,"Caregiver Blues: Tips to help family caregivers cope with depression this holiday season.
Even though the holiday season is a time for family, friends and lots of activities, it can also be a stressful time for many people, especially seniors and their family caregivers. Unrealistic expectations, loneliness, reflection on losses, anxiety about an uncertain future, failing to get enough sleep, exercise, or not eating right are a few reasons that may cause caregiver blues over the holidays.
Here are some great tips on how you, or the family caregiver in your life, can prevent the holiday caregiver blues:
Set realistic expectations for yourself and your family. Know that it’s okay to say “no” and not feel guilty about doing so. Identify two or three-holiday activities you and the senior in your care would like to do over the holidays and stick to those things.
Ask for help. People want to be useful to you, but they may not know how they can best help. Be specific with what you need help with and just ask.
Self-care during the holidays (and throughout the year) is a good thing. Family caregivers need to have time to care for themselves. This will help you stay healthy, recharge, and avoid caregiver burnout. Carve out time to stop, breath, and feel the joy of the season. Take time to get outdoors, to exercise, and to do something uplifting for yourself.
Seek Additional Support. If you’re experiencing caregiver stress or burnout that seems beyond that of the holidays, it may be time to seek additional support. FirstLight Home Care and our professional caregivers help the family caregiver with senior care support. We understand the importance of respite care and how important it is for caregivers to find time to rest and recharge.
Be social. It’s important to find time to interact with family and friends. Carve out time to have fun, laugh and focus on something other than your caregiving responsibilities.
Naps are your friend. Be sure to get enough sleep. You’ll be more stressed if your body is tired and drained of energy.
Avoid overstimulation. If you’re a caregiver for a person with Alzheimer’s or dementia, avoid overly stimulating environments which can increase his/her stress, and yours. Avoid shopping over the weekends or hosting large gatherings that will escalate your stress levels.
Eat right and exercise. Watch what you eat and drink. Certainly, treat yourself this holiday season, but avoid the temptation to overeat those holiday goodies or overindulge in alcoholic beverages. Plus, make time to exercise. Take a walk, ride your bike, or get to the health club for yoga or a swim class. Exercise can be a tremendous benefit to your physical and emotional health.
There are ways for family caregivers to cope with and manage the holiday blues so that they can enjoy everything the holiday season brings.

523,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/preventing-falls-home/,"Be aware of the risk factors that can cause seniors to fall
One in four older Americans falls every year. Falls are the leading cause of injuries for seniors aged 65 and older, so preventing falls can be vital to their overall health.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one out of five falls causes a serious injury, such as broken bones, hip fractures or head injuries. And each year, at least 300,000 older people are hospitalized for hip fractures.
If you have an aging parent or grandparent, helping them reduce their risk of falling can keep them safe, healthy and independent. There are ways of preventing falls in the home. First, you need to be aware of some of the risk factors that can lead to a fall, which include:
- Balance and gait – As we age and become less active, we can lose some coordination, flexibility, and balance, which can cause instability.
- Vision – As we get older, less light reaches our retina, which makes contrasting edges, tripping hazards and other obstacles more difficult to see.
- Medications – Some prescriptions and over-the-counter medications can cause dizziness, dehydration or drowsiness, which can all lead to a fall.
- Environment – Seniors who have lived in their homes for a long time may not think about simple changes they can make to their space to keep it safer as they age.
Now that you know the risks, here are 4 things you can do for preventing falls so that your loved one stays safe and that you have peace of mind.
Monitor their balance
Is your older loved one unsteady on their feet? See if they’re holding onto walls, furniture or someone else when walking, or if they seem to have difficulty getting up from a chair. They may need help improving their balance, strength and gait. A cane, walker or other mobility aid might be the answer. But oftentimes light exercise and regular activity can improve overall stability.
Discuss their health conditions
Is your older loved having trouble managing their own health? Make sure they are remembering to take their medications, and ask if they are experiencing side effects from that medication. Are they having difficulty doing routine daily tasks or do they have other health concerns? If certain health issues are not addressed immediately, it could lead to more serious problems down the road.
Take them for an eye exam
If your parent or grandparent wears glasses, do they have a current prescription? If not, it may be time for an eye exam. Also make sure they are using the glasses as directed by their eye doctor. Remember that sometimes tint-changing lenses can be hazardous when going from bright sunlight to the indoors. And bifocals can be problematic on stairs and other level changes in the home.
Modify their home
There are many things you can do to make your loved one’s home safer so that they may age in place for a long time:
- Pick up anything on the floor that they could trip over, including unnecessary clutter.
- Consider moving anything that is plugged in to a different area of the home if the cords become a tripping hazard.
- Add secure railings to both sides of stairs, inside and out.
- Make sure their home has enough light by adding more or brighter light bulbs.
- Add grab bars inside and outside the tub or shower, as well as next to the toilet. Also consider adding a shower chair or hand-held shower.
At FirstLight, we help seniors enjoy the best quality of life for as long as possible. Contact FirstLight Home Care to learn more about our senior home care solutions that help keep your loved one safe, healthy and independent."
524,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/preventing-falls-in-older-adults/,"According to the National Council on Aging (NCOA), falls are the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal injuries for older Americans. One in four older Americans experiences a fall annually.
Falls threaten seniors’ safety and independence and are a substantial medical risk that can result in hip fractures, cuts and sometimes life-threatening head and brain injuries. Oftentimes a fall is so scary that seniors may avoid certain activities because they are worried that they’ll fall again.
The data is startling. Sixty and Me, an online community of 500,000 women over 60, provided us with some very helpful information that explores basic statistics related to falls in older Americans, as well as the costs and consequences.
If you are a family caregiver, the following quick guide to falls prevention can help keep your aging loved one safe inside the place they call home and provide you with comfort and peace of mind.
Quick Guide to Preventing Falls
Although falls are not a normal part of aging, most of us lose some coordination, flexibility and balance as we age. This can increase our potential to fall. There are some ways to help prevent falls in your elderly loved one.
Remove clutter. The simplest way to prevent falls is to remove clutter from floors, hallways, staircases and sidewalks around your loved one’s home. Unnecessary clutter can be a tripping hazard. Plus, your loved one is at risk of losing their balance and falling when they bend down to pick up the clutter.
Fix trip hazards. Walk through every room of the house and identify potential trip hazards. Fix, remove, or repair items such as loose carpets, throw rugs, uneven flooring, electrical cords, or unnecessary furniture, as well as things like old newspapers and magazines that may be piled up.
Install grab bars and handrails. Hire a handyman or have a family member install grab bars by toilets and bathtubs and handrails in stairways and hallways. A bath seat and a nonslip mat in the bathtub or shower can also help. Most seniors have lived in their homes for such a long time they may have never thought about making simple home modifications that could make aging in place a viable and safer option.
Install proper lighting. Poor lighting is another hazard that can cause falls. Install brighter light bulbs in each room for everyday use. Add night lights in bedrooms and bathrooms for better guidance at night.
Encourage shoes, even in the home. Preventing falls at home can be as simple as wearing sensible shoes. Socks might be more comfortable, but they can also be slippery. Encourage your loved one to wear shoes, even inside the house.
Urge your older adult to slow down. Many falls at home are caused by your elderly loved one moving too quickly while getting in or out of a seated position. It is important for them to take their time. Advise them to pause before sitting or standing to make sure they are steady before moving. Additionally, some prescriptions and over-the-counter medications may cause dizziness or dehydration, which can lead to a fall.

526,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/protecting-parents-common-senior-scams/,"National Senior Citizens Day is August 21st
National Senior Citizens Day was first celebrated in 1988 as a result of a proclamation signed by President Ronald Reagan. Each August 21st, people from across the United States celebrate, recognize, and support senior citizens for their contributions to the community. National Senior Citizen Day is also aimed at raising awareness for the safety of our senior citizens, both economically and physically. Unfortunately, the senior community is often targeted by scammers searching for sensitive, personal information.
This is why it’s important for us to educate and raise awareness among seniors and family caregivers, in the hopes of identifying, avoiding and resolving these senior scams. We turned to the experts at LifeLock to provide information on some of the most common senior scams and how to protect your parent or aging loved one.
Common Scamming Methods
Mail: Theft can occur once a criminal has obtained one’s publicly listed USPS mailing address. Scammers, who often pose as donation collectors, can attempt to exploit an individual for financial, medical, tax, and Social Security information. As discussed here, all of this information can be used to commit acts of identity theft.
Phone: Telemarketers, fake debt collectors, donation solicitors, and even criminals who fraudulently represent government officials can target senior citizens in order to obtain personal information or money.
Digital: Cybercrime strategies, including password theft, account hacking, data breaches and viruses are commonly used by criminals to disable and obtain information from vulnerable individuals. Once personally identifiable information is fraudulently obtained, a criminal can hold the information for ransom, sell it to the highest bidder or use it themselves to drain accounts, apply for loans or accept government benefits.
3 Tips to Help Protect Your Parent
Understand who you’re dealing with: Be sure your parent understands the importance of verifying emails, phone calls and mail. Before responding to someone who is asking for sensitive information, it is important to identify and authenticate them. If it’s not possible to verify their identity or their employer, it’s best to not respond.
Monitor bank accounts: It is always a good habit to check financial accounts on a weekly basis. Most banks have online banking, in which you can monitor transactional history and account balances. With routine check-ups, you can help your parent catch any suspicious activity that may be taking place.
Report scammers: If you happen to catch someone who is attempting to pull off a senior scam, report it. If more people report scams, it is more likely that criminals will be caught.
How to Recover from Being Victim to Fraud
Depending on the type of fraud, the strategies to resolve it may vary. No matter what the case may be, do not wait to take action; the sooner you can try to combat the issue, the better. The following includes tips on how to deal with common fraud issues.
Government identity theft: This occurs when a person falsely shares your information with the government. For example, scammers could file income tax returns in your name using SSN and other personal information in the hope of getting a tax refund.
In the case of government identity theft, contact your local police, the Federal Trade Commission and a major credit reporting agency to put a “fraud alert” on your credit report.
Criminal identity theft: It’s possible for victims of criminal identity theft to have a warrant out for their arrest for a crime they did not commit, likely because someone gave false information to police after getting into trouble with the law.
If this is the case, call your local law enforcement agency and the agency that has issued the warrant. Your local agency should be able to help prove your identity and resolve the issue.
Medical identity theft: Once someone has stolen your identity, it is possible that they may visit a doctor or hospital under your name. If this happens to your parent, their healthcare data could be altered, and that could lead to a loss of healthcare coverage. If your parent is a victim of medical identity theft, here are some steps to follow:
- Ask for copies of their medical records from the providers where their identity may have been used fraudulently.
- Ask your parent’s health care providers for a list of the individuals or companies who have access to their protected health information—it may have the same errors.
- Reach out to medical facilities that are requesting payment for services your parent didn’t receive. Notify them about a potential case of identity theft or mistaken identity, and request information about the service that was provided to help prove your parent didn’t receive that service.
- File a police report in your local jurisdiction.
Make sure your parent knows that scammers are out there. One of the best ways to protect your loved one against fraud is to talk to them about some of the most popular senior scams. As a family caregiver, it’s also important that you educate yourself on these common scams so that you know what to look for. When caring for your parent or other aging loved one, having regular discussions with them can help ensure they don’t fall victim to fraud.

On top of their unique set of challenges, unfortunately this young group of family caregivers has fewer support systems in place.
FirstLight is proud to be the exclusive home care provider for I-Ally, an online community and support network for millennial caregivers. Here is more information on our partnership.
FirstLight Home Care Partners with Trusted Resource for Millennial Caregivers
FirstLight Home Care, a leading provider of home care services, has partnered with I-Ally, a valuable resource for millennial caregivers. FirstLight is proud to be the exclusive home care provider for this online community and support network.
I-Ally not only serves as a hub of information and resources, but it also offers millennial caregivers a free membership to the I-Ally online community. In the community, members can post stories, ask for advice, and find connections with other members experiencing similar caregiving situations.
Its founder, Lucinda Koza, unexpectedly became a full-time caregiver for her father when he experienced a stroke in 2018. “When I became my father’s caregiver, I had a difficult time finding communal support for someone my age,” said Koza. “I quickly realized there was an incredible opportunity to create a resource and a network of support for millennial caregivers to turn to in times of need.”
I-Ally offers vetted partners, expert advice and a community for young family caregivers. The goal is to help this ever-growing group save time, reduce stress, and make informed caregiving decisions by providing services that fulfill their unique needs.
“It’s becoming much more common to see young adults thrust into these caregiving roles,” said Kerri Pendley, Vice President of Strategy for FirstLight Home Care. “Oftentimes they’re not sure where to turn, and they aren’t aware of the support that’s available to them. We have this great opportunity to participate in the I-Ally community as an industry expert, to be a valuable resource and share helpful advice with its members.”
Koza says she wishes she would have had more help navigating the system. “The support of professional caregivers from a company like FirstLight might have given me more peace of mind, as well as helped me feel less overwhelmed and that I was not alone in this. I want members of the I-Ally community to have that same comfort knowing there are resources out there. They don’t have to do this alone.”"

529,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/quit-smoking-for-the-great-american-smokeout/,"Did you know that today, the third Thursday of November, is the Great American Smokeout? Each year, smokers are encouraged to use this date to make a plan for quitting or to quit smoking on that day. Smoking can be especially dangerous for older adults. According to the American Lung Association, older smokers are “significantly less likely than younger smokers to believe that smoking harms their health.” About 8% of those 65 or older are smokers.
Even if it’s just for one day, quitting smoking has many health benefits. In one day, your blood circulation increases and your risk of having a heart attack decreases. In nine months, your lungs become cleaner and function better and your shortness of breath decreases. Long-term, your risk of heart disease, lung cancer, stroke and other serious health conditions decreases.
Many older adults aren’t interested in quitting smoking because they think there is no benefit to them in their advanced age. But, regardless of age, quitting smoking can add years to your life and improve your health and quality of life. Among smokers who quit at age 65, men have been shown to gain 1.4 to 2 years of life and women gain 2.7 to 3.4 years.
Take advantage of today’s Great American Smokeout—help your loved one to make a plan to quit smoking for good. How can you help them quit smoking? Here are some helpful strategies to get you started:
- On the day you decide to quit, throw away all of aging parent’s cigarettes, ashtrays, lighters and matches. Getting rid of the cigarettes and all of the things they need to smoke will make it a little harder to go back to their old ways.
- Make sure they have someone to hold them accountable. That could be an old friend, a family member or even a caregiver. It helps if this person was previously a smoker as well—it will help them to relate to their struggles.
- Help them to find new ways to manage their stress. Many smokers claim that smoking helps to calm their nerves. If your loved one feels that smoking helps them to relax, figure out new ways to get them to calm down.
- Create a reward system. It may seem childish, but rewards can help your family member to stay motivated and to continue to work towards their goal. Make the rewards good—things they will look forward to like CDs, DVDs or books and bigger things for longer periods of time without a cigarette like dinner at a fancy restaurant, concert tickets or trips.
- Figure out how to keep them distracted from cigarette cravings. There are many ways to create distractions, but it is important that you find a method that works for your loved one. This could include exercising, talking to friends or family on the phone, chewing gum, taking a hot bath or shower, drinking water or snacking on healthy treats.
Smoking is a tough habit to break. With positive encouragement and a well thought-out plan, you can help your aging family member begin the journey to becoming free from cigarette cravings. What are some tips you have for others that are trying to quit smoking?"
530,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/random-acts-kindness-good-world-good-health/,"Next Week, February 12 to 18, is Random Acts of Kindness Week. And it’s the perfect opportunity to shower some kindness on the people in your life — or maybe even a total stranger.
We’ve all heard stories about the person at the drive-thru who bought coffee for the stranger who was next in line. Simple deed, big reward. Everyone could use a little boost from time to time to raise their spirits. Those who need a little extra support – an elderly neighbor, an adult with a disability, a loved one recuperating from surgery – could find even the smallest gesture extremely meaningful. So would their caregivers, who no doubt could use a little extra support themselves. We have some ideas that can inspire you to make a difference, no matter how big or small the act of kindness.
Take Part in the Kindness Movement
Spreading kindness starts with one act – one smile, one coffee for a stranger, one favor for a loved one. Doesn’t the world need more kindness? The Random Acts of Kindness Foundation thinks so. It’s a nonprofit organization, founded in 1995, aimed at creating a kindness movement. It provides free online resources to encourage acts of kindness in homes and communities across the globe. Each year, during the second full week of February, it promotes Random Acts of Kindness Week as an opportunity to unite through kindness. The idea is simply to encourage people to adopt kindness as part of their everyday lifestyle – and leave the world better than they found it.
Be Happier and Healthier by Spreading Kindness
When we engage in acts of kindness, there’s no doubt it makes us feel better. But did you know there’s real science to back up why kindness boosts our overall well-being and helps us cope with the stresses of everyday life? Numerous studies show that both giving and receiving acts of kindness increases the production of several life-improving chemicals, including serotonin and oxytocin. Increased levels of serotonin can make you feel happy and relieve anxiety. A boost of oxytocin, also known as the “love hormone,” is produced when people bond socially, and it can lower blood pressure and improve heart health. And if that wasn’t enough, perpetually kind people also have 23 percent less cortisol (the “stress hormone”) and age two times slower than the average population. So spreading kindness is not only good for the person receiving the kind gesture, it’s good for you, too!
Share Acts of Kindness with Those in Need
Sometimes the smallest gesture can make the biggest impact for those whose health and well-being are more fragile – homebound seniors, a disabled veteran, someone who’s recovering from an illness. These are people who would most appreciate a kind action to brighten their day. How can you make a difference? Here are some ideas to point you in the right direction:
- Offer to drive them to a doctor’s appointment.
- Bring them a meal for lunch or dinner.
- Ask for a grocery list and do the shopping for them.
- Stop in for a visit. Play cards or work on a puzzle. Or just sit and chat.
- Offer to take their pet for a walk.
- Make it a habit to bring in their mail and newspaper.
- If you live in a snowy region of the country, shovel their front walk or driveway.
- Short on time? Pick up the phone and say hello! Sometimes a friendly voice is all that’s needed.
Extend Kindness to Their Caregivers
Those who provide care for a loved one are surely deserving of kindness, as well. There are an estimated 43.5 million family caregivers in the United States – that’s one in seven Americans! – who often overlook their own needs to care for others. And they’re often working and managing their own families at the same time – their plates are full! When you’re a caregiver, even the smallest gesture can make life a little easier. Consider identifying someone in your life or in your community who is serving as a caregiver, and do something nice for them. Help alleviate some of their daily stresses and thank them for their ongoing support. The gesture doesn’t have to be complicated or expensive, just something that makes a family caregiver’s life a little easier. Take inspiration from these tips:
- Try asking what’s on their to-do list and offer to help.
- Run a few errands. Make a run to the pharmacy or pick up dry cleaning.
- Help out with house cleaning. Dust and run the vacuum, or hire someone for the job.
- Tackle their yard work. Mowing, weeding, trimming.
- Plan a “respite” evening away from caregiving. Treat them to dinner out or a movie.
- Bring a meal to give them a night off from cooking. Or even just drop by with a batch of cookies!
- Simply check in and ask, “How are you doing?”
- Take over some of the caregiving duties. Sit with their loved one for an hour so they can have a few moments to themselves.
- Gather caregiving information and resources. Put them in touch with people who can help.
- Write a personal letter of thanks. Put pen to paper and tell them how much you appreciate them.

531,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/ready-friendship-day/,"In a little over a week, the United States will be celebrating National Friendship Day and this is a great time to think about the importance of friendship in the lives of our seniors. Having a group of friends to celebrate with and to share their experiences with on a regular basis can be extremely helpful for seniors.
Having the support, care and devotion of friends can help seniors stay active and involved with those that care about them. As caregivers, we know the importance of regular contact with friends and loved ones and are proud to offer these tips from AARP for seniors who want to spend time with their friends.
- Get over the idea that everybody else your age already has all the friends they need. Finding new friends can help you share similar experiences that can enrich your lives and the lives of those that you meet!
- Check out continuing-education classes at your local college or university. In addition, many colleges allow older adults to audit regular classes for free, and some have programs specifically for seniors.
- Senior centers have moved way beyond Friday-night bingo. Most have a variety of classes, activities and even trips. Stop by and ask for a schedule.
- If you’re retired, take a part-time job, even for just a few hours a week. It will expose you to new people and give you a little extra pocket money to boot!
- Volunteer in your community. Museums, hospitals, churches, animal shelters and schools are always looking for people to help out.
- Work out at a nearby gym or the Y — but don’t just do the machine routine: Join a class so you see the same people every week.
No matter our age, it can sometimes be difficult to convince ourselves to try new things and meet new people, but the benefits that can be gained are certainly worth the effort. Regardless of what you may think the expectations are for having friends, finding ways to meet new people and enjoying the opportunity to share life experiences is a wonderful component of Friendship Day. The caregivers at FirstLight Home Care encourage seniors to take advantage of Friendship Day 2016 and to find a way to make a new friend during this celebration!"
532,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/recognizing-the-financial-burdens-of-family-caregivers/,"In the United States, there are 65 million family caregivers who provide unpaid care for a chronically ill, disabled, or aging relative—amounting to an estimated $375 billion a year in unpaid services. Many of these caregivers are also part of the Sandwich Generation, meaning they also work for a living and juggle caring for their own children. With the future of many government-funded programs such as Social Security and Medicare up in the air, the question of easing the financial burden of family caregivers struggling to do it all still remains.
According to the National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC), 47% of working caregivers say the increases in caregiving expenses have caused them to use up all or most of their savings. In addition to the financial aspects, the challenges of caring for an elderly loved one can be overwhelming and the resulting stress can lend itself to a whole slew of health issues for the caregiver.
Currently, the CLASS Act is supposed to be a long-term health insurance plan offered by the federal government, through employers, that would provide participants with the cash to help pay for needed caregiving assistance—basically a way for family caregivers to get paid a small sum. So far, the Obama administration has yet to put this into effect."
533,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/recovery-after-a-stroke-tips-for-the-family-caregiver/,"May is National Stroke Awareness Month.
If you are caring for a family member who has had a stroke, and you are helping them recover in their home, we know firsthand the high levels of emotional and physical stress you both may experience without proper in-home care services.
Caregivers play a vital role in the post-stroke recovery process. The more aware caregivers are of available resources, programs, services, and self-care tips – for the stroke survivor and themselves – the more likely they will affect positive outcomes and keep stress at a minimum.
FirstLight Home Care has put together the following helpful tips for the family caregiver.
Ask questions. Recovering from a stroke will impact every individual differently. It is important to understand your loved one’s condition and to ask questions of the doctors in his or her care. Be aware of your loved one’s medications and side effects. Learn about post-stroke treatment plans, therapies, necessary home modifications, and other resources, such as home care assistance, that may help with your in-home caregiving. Ask a doctor, nurse or therapist to answer your questions about what to expect so that you can be prepared.
Find a stroke support group. It is important that the family caregiver doesn’t feel completely alone in their new in-home caregiving journey. Find a support group in your area to create social opportunities outside of your in-home caregiving duties and to become a sounding board for you when making difficult decisions and locating local resources. Members of these support groups know what you’re going through and can be helpful on many levels. Start or find a support group in your area.
As change occurs, understand your options for help. A change in abilities and/or skills can result in a change in services during stroke recovery. Medicare coverage for rehabilitation therapies may be available if your loved one’s physical function has changed. Any improvement or decline in motor skills, speech or self-care since the last time your loved one was in therapy may mean eligibility changes in services. Consult with your loved one’s healthcare provider, case manager, social worker or insurance company to find out how much and how long insurance (private or government-supported) will cover medical and rehabilitation services in and out of the hospital and to determine out-of-pocket expenses. This can vary from one case to another.
Take care of yourself. Take a break from in-home caregiving by asking another family member, friend or neighbor to help while you take time for yourself to exercise, rest and handle your own personal needs. If there isn’t anyone who can step in while you take much-needed (and well-deserved) time for respite care, consider hiring a professional caregiver.
Monitor emotions. Stop depression before it hinders your loved one’s recovery and your in-home caregiving ability. Post-stroke sadness and depression are common, with as many as 30 to 50 percent of stroke survivors experiencing depression during any phase of recovery (Source: National Stroke Association).
Taking care of the physical and emotional needs of others can be stressful and depression can occur with caregivers too. It can take a toll on a caregiver’s ability to care for their loved one, especially when the caregiver feels unhappy or hopeless and then their own needs are put on the back burner. Consult a healthcare professional to develop a plan of action at the first signs of depression.
Be patient. Be kind. The stroke survivor and the family caregiver need to be patient with and kind to each other during stroke recovery. Take things one day at a time. The road to recovery takes time, and everyone involved may often feel frustrated. Do not take your frustrations out on each other or on other people. Talk with a family member, friend, professional or support group about your feelings. Try not to compare life now to how it was before your loved one suffered the stroke.
We understand how stressful family caregiving can be, especially when caring for those who have experienced a stroke. We hope these tips will help you learn to manage the demands while finding time for your own personal care.

534,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/reducing-the-high-cost-of-hospital-readmissions/,"Millions of Americans go to the hospital each year for reasons that are often necessary and unavoidable. Whether we fall, get sick, or hurt ourselves in a number of different ways, going to the hospital for medical care is something that we simply can’t avoid. However, the same cannot be said for a substantial fraction of people who are readmitted to hospitals each year. Hospital readmission is not only extremely costly and harmful to the patient, it can be easily avoided with proper care and precaution. Although there are many factors that can play into the need for a hospital readmission, the most common reasons for them are poor discharge and transition processes, improper home care, and a lack of patient support. For the elderly, hospital readmissions are much too common and can lead to future health complications.
So how can you prevent costly and harmful hospital readmissions for your aging parents? The answer is easier than you may think. Below is a brief list of tips that you should follow in order to reduce costly hospital admissions for your aging parents.
Before you leave the hospital
As your parents prepare for discharge at the hospital, make sure you are educated in the health status of your parents before they go home. Many hospitals are over crowded and may discharge parents before they are ready. Make sure your parents health is stable enough for home recovery before you take them home. Once your parents health is stable enough for discharge, speak with the medical professionals to ensure you understand the status of their health, as well as what you need to do once they are home. This may seem straight forward, but many people do not receive a sufficient amount of information about their parents before they go home. You can never ask too many questions, and the worst situation you can find yourself in is not knowing what to do when there is no one there to help you.
What to do once you are home
Next, ensure that your parents have proper home care during their recovery. Aging adults are often readmitted to hospitals as a result of complications that arise after their
discharge from the hospital. This means that understanding how to care for your parents at home can play a vital role in their health and can be the difference between a healthy recovery and readmission. Don’t know what to do? Get help from home care professionals such as the FirstLight Home Care caregivers. The simple act of having a little extra help can make a big difference in your parents recovery, and it can help ease the worry that is involved with taking care of ailing parents.
Additional Tips from a Certified CNA:
1. Follow directions the doctor gives you
– Administer medications at the same time each day
– Perform treatments and exercises as directed
2. Keep area of wound sterile to avoid infection
– Actively change bandages with sterile hands
– Monitor the wound and take notes on how it is healing
3. Limit patient’s movement after serious injuries
– Don’t rush the recovery as it will only aggravate the injury
– Play on the safe side when performing new exercises making sure your parents are healthy enough to perform them"
535,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/reflections-on-senior-health-and-fitness-day/,"Summer has not officially started, but this coming Memorial Day Weekend may as well be its kick-off. It also presents an opportune time for seniors to get out and stay active with families and friends. In fact, many already got a jumpstart on their plans this past Wednesday when an estimated 100,000 seniors across the country participated in the 17th annual National Senior Health and Fitness Day. As a result, I was inspired to read about how community centers and YMCAs across the country hosted events that promoted wellness for participants of all fitness levels.
In Westchester, N.Y., it was swimming, yoga, tai chi and dancing that dominated the day for area residents. Austin, Texas, seniors chose from nearly 1,000 local events promoting physical fitness, good nutrition and preventative care. And at the Rye YMCA in Rye, N.Y., a group of self-proclaimed “Golden Oldies” shimmied their way through a morning of exercise grooves that left them revived and rejuvenated.
Rejuvenation, in fact, is a key component for senior wellness—and what better way to promote it than through hosting a national day that inspires seniors to mobilize and better manage their health. National Senior Health and Fitness Day was first launched as a public/private partnership of the Mature Market Resource Center, a national information clearinghouse for the older adult market. Nearly 20 years later, the day has continued to gain national exposure and popularity thanks to rising numbers of the aging and Baby Boomer populations and their desire to stay physically fit.
While some of FirstLight Home Care’s clients may not always be able to exercise regularly, it’s important for seniors of all ages to work even the most minimal physical activities into their daily routine. Not only will it improve their health, but it will also improve their mental well being. Our in-home care givers are sensitive to the needs of their clients while promoting exercise and healthy habits. Through their care, they can ensure that the sun shines on these seniors year round—not just the first glorious weekend of summer."
536,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/relocating-an-elder-parent/,"Recently, my parents, who are in their late 70’s, decided to relocate from California to Ohio in order to be closer to other family members, including me. After my dad broke his hip and my mom suffered a fall, they knew it was in their best interests to be near family who could provide future care, if need be. Surprisingly, my parents approached me about the issue—in many instances, adult children are the ones initiating this conversation and the elder may be reluctant or apprehensive to relocate. Going in, I had no idea of the details that had to be considered when making a cross-country move. From my own personal experience, here are a few things to consider when helping a parent relocate:
Insurance: It’s important to think about how a move will affect your elder’s insurance policies. I found out that the policies in Ohio differ greatly than the policy my parents had in California.
Downsize: My parents’ new home in Ohio is smaller than the condo they previously owned in California—of course, there wasn’t room for all of their belongings. Passing down heirlooms to family members, hosting a garage sale, or donating unwanted items to a local charity are all great ways to downsize before a move.
Have a care plan: As the eldest child with my own children grown and out of the house, I feel I am well-equipped and in a good position to provide care for my parents. If you have other family members in the area, it’s important to map out a care plan and delegate responsibility before the move. This ensures that everyone is on the same page and knows what to expect after the move.
Socialization tactics: Moving to a new place in a new neighborhood can be very overwhelming for an elderly person. Make an effort to help your senior get out of the house to meet new people and get involved in the community. It will help them adjust and become acquainted with their new home."
537,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/remembering-our-seniors-this-4th-of-july/,"The Fourth of July holiday is a popular time for friends and family to come together for celebration. While many people look forward to this holiday weekend all summer, seniors can find this time to be especially lonely. Whether their family members live a distance away or their mobility is limited due to health issues, many seniors can end up alone for the holiday.
As you plan your Fourth of July celebrations, keep in mind the seniors and other elderly loved ones in your life. If you aren’t able to spend time with them in person, making a quick phone call or sending a card or email goes a long way in letting them know you are thinking of them.
Best wishes for a safe and happy Fourth of July!"
538,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/researching-care-for-your-parents/,"Caring for the people you love can be an honor, but it can quickly become an overwhelming task, too. It can be difficult to maintain your daily routine—whether you’re working, raising a family, or both—while simultaneously caring for your aging parents. It’s natural to want them to have the best possible care, and passing that responsibility to someone else can involve some hard decisions.
Here are a few things to keep in mind while researching care for your parents:
Assess their current needs
The first step to keep in mind is what your parents need physically and mentally. Think about the main tasks that seniors need help with: mobility, transportation, medications, personal care, and nutrition. It’s not uncommon for seniors to require a little extra assistance for day-to-day tasks, but are they struggling more with a specific task? What about their mental health? Do you find that your parent is becoming forgetful, or maybe even lonely?
There are multiple caregiving options available (personal care, memory care, companion care, travel care), so it’s important to take note of your parent’s needs before choosing a home care service. Once you have an idea of the type of care needed, you can delve into further research.
Research financial aspects
A crucial step in the process of allowing your parents to age gracefully is to do your research on the financial commitment of senior care. There is no wrong way to finance home care; it’s just a matter of properly looking into each option. Consider exploring Medicare options, private pay, and government or community programs. If your loved one is a veteran, look into benefits they could potentially receive thanks to their service. Another option you could explore is a personal line of credit. A personal line of credit is a set amount of money from which you can borrow in a given time period, only paying interest on the amount that you’ve drawn. Knowing the different options available to you or whoever is funding the care is an essential part of the research process, so don’t hesitate to get all the details on any financial option you’re considering.
Look for an extraordinary caregiver
It can be difficult to accept the fact that you need to find extra care for your parents because you can’t do it all yourself. For many family members, it can be one of the toughest decisions to have to make. You want to find someone who will love and care for your parents the same way you do. This is arguably the most important part of the research process: don’t settle for care that’s anything short of extraordinary. This means that while researching care for your parents, take time to look for a caregiver who is patient, compassionate, detail-oriented, and present. You’ll be able to rest easy knowing that the person you love the most is being taken care of by someone who has their best interest and wellbeing at the forefront.
Remember that you know your loved ones and what their priorities are more than anyone else. Doing the proper research to ensure they’re taken care of—physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially—will help give you peace of mind in the future."

540,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/respite-care-caring-for-e-caregiver/,"If you are the primary caregiver in your family, then you’ll be able to relate to this blog post. It can be exhausting to care for an aging parent or a family member 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You are going to need a break — a time to regroup and re-energize yourself. You may not want to admit exhaustion and although taking a break isn’t on the schedule, but here are some ways you can help care for the caregiver:
Take the person in care away: If the person in care can still travel, offer to take him or her into your home for a week or more. Make the travel arrangements yourself. If your aging family member cannot travel alone, do not ask your family caregiver to get him or her back and forth. Instead, work out a plan where you can pick-up and return. Give your caregiver the ultimate luxury of a week at home with no responsibilities for anyone else.Visit often: If you live less than a few hours away, then make time each month to drive over and visit. Schedule these times with the caregiver so that he/she can plan to be away while you are visiting. Do something that will free up the caregiver’s duties. For example, pack a lunch and eat with the aging parent. Bring groceries along too so that you can make dinner.
Find local or online support groups: A caregiver support group is a great way to share your situation and find people who are going through the same experiences that you are living each day. In the support groups we have been involved in, typically people will talk about the challenges they are facing and listen to others talk; you will not only get help, but you will also be able to help others who are facing similar situations. We think the biggest thing you will get out of joining a support group is that you will find out that you are not alone. It will make you feel better knowing that other people are in the same situation, and their knowledge can be invaluable, especially if they are caring for someone with the same illness as you are.
Companion Care: Offer to provide a service, like FirstLight Home Care, to come to the home with their Companion Care services. This can provide your caregiver with needed breaks they need to get rejuvenated during the day or week, and your loved one with some valuable diversions and activities that a Companion Care service can provide.

541,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/respite-care-for-the-dementia-caregiver/,"I just don’t know when I’m going to have time to get all my errands done.
It would be so nice to take a long walk. Or even a long nap!
I really wish I could spend some time catching up with my friends.
If you’re a dementia caregiver, you may have spoken these words a time or two. And for good reason! Everyone deserves a break, especially those family caregivers who devote so much time taking care of a loved one with Alzheimer’s or dementia.
Enter respite care for the dementia caregiver…
Respite care allows you to take temporary time off from your responsibilities as a primary caregiver so that you can focus on yourself for a while. It also ensures that your loved one living with Alzheimer’s or dementia continues to receive the care they need in a safe, supportive and familiar environment.
Using respite services can strengthen and enhance your ability to be a dementia caregiver. It also can give you comfort and peace of mind knowing that your loved one is spending time with another caring individual.
But making the decision to use respite care can be tough.
You may feel guilty about bringing someone else in to help, especially if you believe you can and should “do it all.” But if you don’t take an occasional break, you can become frustrated, depressed and even ill. And if that happens, you might not be able to take care of your loved one at all.
You may think respite care is too expensive. The cost of respite services can vary greatly depending on the level of care that is needed. While cost should be considered, remember that respite services are meant to be a short-term solution that can benefit both the dementia caregiver and the person needing care. Those benefits can often outweigh the costs.
You may be concerned about the dependability of a professional caregiver. However, those who work for an agency or facility should be reliable, qualified and well trained. For example, FirstLight caregivers are direct employees (not contractors), state-licensed where required, and thoroughly screened with a corresponding background-check. They also must pass through our rigorous in-home care training. Additionally, after our thorough recruitment and home care training, all employees must go through our unique Culture of Care training and orientation process.
If you’re not sure about bringing in respite care, really look at your options.
- Can friends or family step in to help for a while?
- Look at in-home care providers.
- Your local aging agency or the Alzheimer’s Association may be able to offer advice on resources.
- Consider bringing in care for short amounts of time to test it, get comfortable with it and see if it fits your situation.
- Make sure the respite caregivers you bring in are trained in dementia care.
Caring for those with dementia is challenging unless you are equipped with specialized training and tools to effectively assist those living with the disease. FirstLight Home Care provides a comprehensive memory care training plan for its team members to ensure the services provided to dementia clients are as unique as the individuals they were designed for.
Our memory care practitioners are certified by the National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners, LLC, and they utilize this training in developing specific care plans for clients with dementia. We provide quarterly training and certification, online and on-site, for caregivers and client family members.
Our memory care experts develop meaningful connections with the people they serve. We understand that who they are – and who they’ve been – impacts how they talk, act, remember and behave when living with dementia.

543,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/respite-care-make-difference/,"Don’t feel guilty about taking care of yourself too.
Consider respite care. Caring for a loved one can be very fulfilling. Family members often step in as caregivers to help an elderly parent or grandparent, chronically ill family member or loved one with a disability because they are loving and compassionate, and because they would do anything to ensure that person has the best quality of life possible.
However, caregiving is often a full-time job that can impact your health and well-being, job performance and overall life balance. Suddenly you find yourself putting your own needs aside and you forget to take care of yourself. Or maybe you think you can do it all without anyone’s help. This can lead to caregiver stress, anger or resentment, and it sometimes can feel like the relationship you have with a family member is now an obligation. If you’re finding it difficult to care for someone by yourself, don’t let it get this far. Respite care can help.
What is Respite Care?
Respite care services are designed to offer temporary relief by having a professional caregiver come in and take care of your loved one when you are unable to do so. It allows you to take some time off from your responsibilities as a primary caregiver so that you can focus on yourself. Caregivers are there to make sure your loved one is cared for in a safe, familiar environment while you take a much-needed break.
Respite care services can be provided for a couple of hours to an entire day, or even longer if needed. Services can include companion care, mobility assistance, bathing and personal hygiene, dementia care, special diets and meal preparation, light housekeeping and much more.
Taking Care of YOU
Family caregivers who don’t take time for themselves can experience increased levels of stress, exhaustion, and even serious health problems. Caregivers should not feel guilty for wanting some time for themselves.
- Take a break. Step out of the everyday routine – if even it’s just for a few hours a week – to relax and re-energize.
- Spend time doing something you love. Read a book, see a movie, spend time with family and friends or take part in your favorite hobby.
- Plan a weekend getaway. Taking an occasional mini vacation can help you re-focus, unwind and get the rest you need.
- Take care of your own commitments. When you’re caring for someone else, it can sometimes be difficult to keep up with your own errands such as shopping, exercising, getting a haircut or going to the doctor
Wanting a break is normal, and it can strengthen the relationship you have with the person you are caring for. If you’re happy, healthy and rested, everyone wins!
FirstLight’s respite care services can help you find the “you” you’ve been missing without compromising the quality of care and attention your family member needs.

Many caregivers have no lunch hours, no coffee breaks, and no vacation. We all need breaks. It is why we are always emphasizing the importance of respite care. You will be a better caregiver when you dedicate time to recharge. Respite care, which allows you to take time off while your loved one is in someone else’s care, provides that time off. To start, you need to find the person or persons able to help you. This can be another family member or it can be an organization like FirstLight Home Care. Once you have this in place you will see that taking time for yourself this holiday season (or really any time throughout the year) will help you. Why you should consider getting help to support you as a caregiver:
- You will be a better caregiver. If you are overwhelmed with caring for a loved one, you can be at risk for experiencing problems like depression, guilt, anger, sleep disorders and strained social and family relationships. Refreshed caregivers provide better care. Having a backup plan in case you are unexpectedly unable to provide care will also reduce everyone’s anxiety.
- You will be healthier. Time off is necessary for mental and physical health.
- You can be able to get errands and chores done for you and your family that have been piling up.
- You can take a vacation. Everyone needs time for themselves. It can be a couple of hours or a short-term break (aka a vacation) will help you to avoid burnout.
- You can go out and have some fun. This is very important. Caregivers are people too. They need breaks and time to get out and enjoy time with family and friends or even time alone. This time allows you to reconnect, regroup, and get recharged."
545,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/respite-care/,"You may be burnt out. Stressed out. Like many Americans, you may be taking care of your Mom, Dad, or other loved ones. On top of that, you may also have a job and an immediate family of your own. There is not enough hours in a day – definitely not enough hours to take care of yourself.
You want to scream: can’t I get a break?
As a matter of fact, you can and you need one.
What The Numbers Say
According to the National Alliance for Caregiving, you are not alone. In fact, more than 65 million people, 29% of the U.S. population, provide care for a chronically ill, disabled or aged family member or friend during any given year and spend an average of 20 hours per week providing care for their loved one. The value of this unpaid care is estimated at $306 billion annually.
As a result, caregivers are often in poor health themselves. Numerous studies have shown the impact on a caregiver’s emotional, mental and physical health, particularly if the care they are providing is long-term. Like 70% of the caregiving population, you may suffer from depression, fatigue or exhaustion. The stress can build up, leaving you to become a chronic worry wart, feeling like there is no end in sight. Your neglect your own health, skipping dental checkups, mammograms and other preventative treatments. And getting your own hair done? A long ago dream!
Take Care of Yourself
Making yourself a priority is not easy. You need to tap other family and friends to give you a break. If your caregiving stint is going to be short-term and you are employed, check out the Family Leave and Medical Act which requires employers with 50 or more employees to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for employees who need time off to care for a seriously ill family member.
If you can’t afford to take time off, you may consider hiring a reputable healthcare agency like FirstLight Home Care for respite care. Respite care provides short-term, temporary relief to those who are caring for family members. You can schedule a couple of hours a week, a month, or even a whole week off if you want to schedule a vacation! Respite care can provided a much needed break for you the caregiver and the person you are caring for as well.
Taking advantage of respite care before you become exhausted, overwhelmed or isolated is ideal. Just knowing that someone you trust can provide regular relief can be a lifesaver!
Respite has been shown to help sustain family caregiver health and wellbeing. An outcome based evaluation pilot study showed that respite may also reduce the likelihood of divorce and help sustain marriages.
And the great part of respite care with FirstLight is that your loved ones don’t have to leave their home where they are the most comfortable. FirstLight caregivers come into your home and provide a variety of services to your loved one, focusing on whatever their needs may be.
It is important not to feel guilty for needing a break. If you become overwhelmed, you can begin to resent the role you are undertaking. Keep an online calendar so you can share the task of caregiving and schedule your own appointments in advance.
When you devote so much love and energy to caregiving, it may be difficult to entrust your family member’s care to strangers. Our caregivers are carefully screened, and ideally matched to your family’s needs and lifestyle.
Taking care of yourself makes you a more effective caregiver and is better for everybody in the long run!"
546,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/restoring-confidence-rehabilitative-care/,"From injuries to necessary surgeries, getting the help you need after an operation can be difficult. More often than not, the responsibility places a heavy burden on your loved ones and the life altering after effects can also result in post-operative depression. FirstLight Home Care Rehabilitative Care can offer assistance for injured senior adults and those who need additional service to enhance their quality of life.
For injured adults or those coming out of the hospital, rehabilitative and post-operative care is more than just physical therapy. Instead, it’s a personal service designed to help individuals recover and restore their confidence and independence.
Here are three ways how to restore confidence with rehabilitative care:
- Time to heal: Being able to devote time and energy to healing can be tough when also dealing with the daily responsibilities of life. Post-operative care offers that time by having a professional caregiver come in and tend to needs in the home and other errands so the focus can be on recovery.
- Time to bond: For recent mothers, spending time with the baby is critical for bonding and future development. However, after leaving the hospital and returning home, the needs of the household can make it tough for quality bonding to take place. Post-operative care works as a way to help new mothers spend time with their child and ensure daily chores get accomplished at the same time.
- Time to rejuvenate: Physical health improvements have routinely been linked to stronger emotional health. Rehabilitative services can help injured loved ones concentrate on becoming physically active again to become more accepting of their condition and in turn, improve their emotional well-being.
If you or your loved ones have been injured, are recovering, or recently returned home from a surgery, working with a post-operative care specialist can help regain confidence faster to improve overall well-being with FirstLight Home Care Rehabilitative Care. To find out more of the benefits of rehabilitative care, contact your local FirstLight Home Care location today."

In case you didn’t know, Alzheimer’s is a degenerative brain disease and the most common form of dementia. Dementia is not a specific disease. It is a general term that describes a group of symptoms.
Every September during World Alzheimer’s Month, people from around the world strive to raise awareness and to challenge the stigma around Alzheimer’s and dementia.
2021 marks the 10th year of this important global campaign.
The Alzheimer’s Association®, the leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer’s care, support and research, is a valuable resource for those who want to learn more about this disease and get involved in the fight to end it.
Because family caregivers who are caring for loved ones often face special challenges, the organization also provides several helpful caregiving resources.
According to the Alzheimer’s Association, researchers believe there is not one single cause of Alzheimer’s disease. They think it develops from many factors, including genetics, lifestyle and environment. Scientists have also identified factors that increase the risk of the disease. While some can’t be changed, emerging evidence suggests there may be others we can influence.
Whether it’s making better lifestyle choices or managing a health condition, prevention often starts with understanding what you can change. Read about the causes and risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease.

But it is important to plan ahead and take steps to ensure the safety of your loved ones on the road. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have established recommendations to help families with aging drivers discuss changes in your older loved one’s driving.
- Stay physically active: Staying physically active improves your strength and flexibility. In turn, physical activity can improve driver safety by making it easier to turn the steering wheel, look over your shoulder, and make other movements while driving and parking.
- Schedule regular vision and hearing tests. Confirm with your senior drivers that they have had a hearing and vision test in the last year. Because hearing and vision tend to decline with age, these tests should be done annually. Impaired hearing can be a concern for older drivers by limiting their ability to hear an approaching emergency vehicle or train. Common age-related vision problems — such as cataracts, glaucoma and macular degeneration — also can make it difficult to see clearly or drive at night.
- Manage any chronic conditions. Work with the senior driver’s doctor to manage any chronic conditions — especially those that might impact driver safety, such as diabetes or seizures. Follow your doctor’s instructions for managing your condition and staying safe behind the wheel. This might include adjusting the treatment plan and/or restricting when the elderly driver is on the road.
Driving gives us a sense of freedom and independence. We know this is very important for our aging population, but we all must be safe and responsible drivers – regardless of your age.

550,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/safety-falls-are-preventable/,"Falls are the leading cause of injury-related death for adults age 65 and older, according to Injury Facts 2015, the statistical report on unintentional injuries created by the National Safety Council. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention:
- One in three older adults fall each year.
- About 2.5 million nonfatal falls were treated in emergency departments in 2013.
- Of those, 734,000 people were admitted to the hospital.
- That year, 25,500 older adults died from unintentional falls More than 250,000 hip fractures are reported every year, and 95% of those are from falls.
The good news. Falls are preventable and better news for those of us getting older, aging, itself, does not cause falls. Many of the underlying causes of older adult falls have to do with muscle weakness, dizziness caused from some medications, improper footwear, impaired vision, slick floors, poor lighting, loose rugs, clutter and uneven surfaces. All of these conditions can be improved.
We all know that falls can happen anywhere, but they are more likely to occur in your home. Here are some tips from the National Safety Council that you can do to help protect your loved one from falling when at home:
- Remove clutter, small furniture, pet gear, electrical cords, throw rugs and anything else that might cause someone to trip.
- Remove any furniture they are not using to increase space.
- Check the carpets. Consider removing all throw rugs to avoid trips and slips.
- Keep outdoor areas well lit and walkways smooth. In the winter make sure snow and ice are removed.
- Use non-slip adhesive strips on stairs.
- Use non-skid mats or appliques in the bath and shower.
- Install grab bars in the tub, shower and near the toilet.
- Install railings on both sides of stairs. Look at the lighting in each room and make sure it is adequate.
- Place nightlights in the kitchen, bath and hallways.
- Make often-used items more accessible, like food, clothing, etc., so an older person won’t be tempted to use a stool or ladder to get to them.
- If necessary, provide personal walking devices, such as a cane or walker, to aid in stability."
551,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/safety-tips-for-senior-travel-senior-safety-during-holiday-travel/,"For many people, winter is full of family, friends and food. However, winter weather may make it more complicated to get out of the house, especially when an aging family member is the one driving. Seniors without traveling caregivers have to rely on their own vehicle for transportation, and they should be aware that driving in winter weather requires additional safety measures and extra care.
Senior Travel Tips For Driving During The Holidays
Winterization Of Vehicles
Make sure the brakes, headlights and windshield wipers are working properly. Also, check on the antifreeze levels, oil levels, gas tank levels and tires. It is important, especially for seniors, that the heater and defroster are fully functioning as seniors are more susceptible to the frigid winter temperatures.
Avoid Road Closures and High Traffic Times
During heavy traffic periods, there are more people on the road and higher chances for traffic accidents. If the roads are bad, avoid using back roads and shortcuts. Many of these roads are less likely to be plowed or salted and may be more dangerous than well-traveled roads.
Emergency Preparedness
Put together an emergency kit to store in the trunk of the car, including:
- A blanket
- Food and water
- A flashlight with extra batteries
- A first-aid kit
- Jumper cables
- An ice scraper
- Sand, salt or non-clumping kitty litter to provide extra tire traction
- Extra clothing, boots and gloves
If you are a family caregiver and don’t feel comfortable with your family member driving in the winter weather, don’t hesitate to ask for help. An elderly travel companion is the perfect plus-one to get your loved one from point A to point B safely.
Family Caregiver Travel Tips
There is no doubt the holidays can be demanding. For family caregivers, this time of year can be even more difficult due to less time and additional responsibilities. FirstLight Home Care has wrapped up some tips for traveling caregivers to help them make it through the holiday season with more joy and less stress.
Establish ground rules.
In advance of family arriving, make sure you communicate the physical and mental changes or abilities of the loved one in your care so there are no surprises. It’s okay to plan for visits throughout the holidays but also plan for plenty of downtime for your loved and for you.
Simplify.
Ease the holiday chaos and burden by simplifying. Minimize holiday decorations in and around your loved one’s home. Also, be aware that flashing lights can be frightening to some Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, while wires and decorative items can become tripping hazards.
Plan ahead of time.
The more you can do in advance of company arriving, the better it will be for you and the family member in your care.
- Encourage some of your family get-togethers to be potluck meals instead of cooking everything yourself.
- Stock up on groceries in the event of impromptu visits from friends and family.
- Purchase gift cards to have on hand for last-minute gift-giving needs.
- Hire a professional caregiver to help you with day-to-day activities around the home or with specific errands so that you have the time and energy to enjoy the holidays.
Maintain routines.
Keep your loved one on a regular routine as much as possible. Sticking with their daily habits of eating, sleeping and medication schedules will help with behavioral and emotional challenges, and it can reduce feelings of anxiety and stress.
Ask for assistance.
Enlist the help of friends and family who may have time off during the holidays or who are in town visiting.
- Ask family members to help with grocery shopping.
- Have friends and family bring over meals that can be frozen in advance of upcoming gatherings.
- Ask a neighbor to help string up holiday lights.
- Ask family to help with wrapping gifts or take advantage of local gift-wrapping services.
- Hire traveling caregivers to come in and support you before, during and after the holidays.
Remember self-care.
The holidays can be a crazy time of year and it can be easy to let your own needs slip. However, it has been proven that when you take care of yourself, you take better care of others. Watch for these signs:
- Loss of motivation.
- Feelings of disconnection with your loved one, other relationships or work.
- Feeling depressed, irritable or hopeless.
- Lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed.
Hiring an elderly travel companion can help with burnout, in addition to reading a book, taking a long walk or having coffee with a friend.
Benefits Of A Senior Travel Companion
Elderly travel companions can be great during the winter months. Not only do they keep your loved ones awake and aware, but they can also help them navigate the slippery roads and get through heavy traffic. If your loved ones don’t have someone to travel with in bad winter weather, make sure that you or someone else knows where they’re going, and they have a cell phone in case of an emergency.
Firstlight Home Care – Senior Travel Companion Services
Senior travel can be merry with the help of traveling caregivers. ‘Tis the holiday season! It’s not just about “surviving” this time of the year – it’s also about thriving. FirstLight offers a variety of services such as travel companionship to make visiting family and friends a breeze."
552,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/safety-tips-for-seniors-living-alone/,"According to figures compiled by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) approximately 87 percent of individuals in the U.S. aged 65+ expect to be able to “age in place.” As the population ages, that means the numbers of seniors living alone — independently, or semi-independently, as long as possible will continue to grow.
But with aging in place, there are risks that need to be weighed. Is the home safe? Does it provide the necessary environment? Can the senior navigate the home without impediments? What simple improvements can help? These are questions the professional caregivers at FirstLight Home Care can answer if you have seniors living alone.
Safety in the home is one of the most important factors in whether a senior can remain at home or not, so that is why FirstLight Home Care offers many resources for seniors and their loved ones, and much information—including our White Paper titled The Consumer’s Guide to Home Safety for Seniors – can be accessed through our website. Here are the TOP 11 improvements to help seniors remain safe at home, according to the report:
1-Levered doorknobs
2-Grab bars in bathrooms
3-Levered faucets in kitchen sink
4-Handrails on both sides of stairwells and on front and rear steps
5-Grab bars in showers
6-Removal of any door threshold
7-Movable shower heads for those who must sit
8-Portable shower seats
9-A bathroom with a bath/shower and a bedroom on the first floor
10-Widened doors to accommodate wheelchairs
11-Ramps for those using walkers and wheelchairs
Some of these improvements are simple and the cost is very low. It’s also possible that some of the costs for improvements can be reimbursed through Medicare or the senior’s insurance. Before you decide if your senior can remain at home, or if you have questions about other topics related to caregiving, contact us through the “Just Ask FirstLight” form on our website."
553,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/scleroderma-facts/,"Pronounced “skleer-oh-DUR-muh”, it is a disease that involves the hardening and tightening of the skin and connective tissues – the fibers that provide the framework and support for your body.
June is Scleroderma awareness month. The entire month has been dedicated to this disease because so few people know about it, but yet, there is an increasing number of people being diagnosed with the disease. And, since awareness of the disease is low, many researchers do not always receive the resources they need to better understand the cause, symptoms and find a cure.
Scleroderma affects women more often than men and most commonly occurs between the ages of 30 and 50. While there is no cure for this disease, a variety of treatments can ease symptoms and improve quality of life.
What are the symptoms of Scleroderma?
Scleroderma signs and symptoms vary, depending on which parts of your body are involved:
Skin. Nearly everyone who has scleroderma experiences a hardening and tightening of patches of skin. These patches may be shaped like ovals or straight lines, or cover wide areas of the trunk and limbs. The number, location and size of the patches vary.
Fingers or toes. One of the earliest signs of scleroderma is an exaggerated response to cold temperatures or emotional distress, which can cause numbness, pain or color changes in the fingers or toes.
Digestive system. In addition to acid reflux, which can damage the section of esophagus nearest the stomach, some people with this disease may also have problems absorbing nutrients if their intestinal muscles aren’t moving food properly through the intestines.
Heart, lungs or kidneys. The disease can affect the function of the heart, lungs or kidneys to varying degrees. These problems, if left untreated, can become life-threatening.
What causes this disease?
Scleroderma results from an overproduction and accumulation of collagen in body tissues. Collagen is a fibrous type of protein that makes up your body’s connective tissues, including your skin. (Mayo Clinic, 2017)
Doctors aren’t certain what prompts this abnormal collagen production, but the body’s immune system appears to play a role. In some genetically susceptible people, symptoms may be triggered by exposure to certain types of pesticides, epoxy resins or solvents.
What are the treatment options?
In some cases, the skin problems associated with scleroderma fade away on their own in three to five years. The type of scleroderma that affects internal organs can worsen over time and require a variety of medications to help control symptoms and prevent complications.
If you have more questions or concerns about Scleroderma, you should consult your doctor."
554,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/secrets-of-maintaining-a-healthy-relationship/,"Recently, the media has been having a field day covering the downfall of successful couples. Even breaking news stations such as CNN are covering the scandals of a certain California governor. With the negative attitudes surrounding marriage everywhere, it is refreshing to see inspirational print about couples. Here are some tips, courtesy of AARP.com, for maintaining a successful relationship:
Find new activities to do together
Doing the same activities as a couple quickly turns into a dull routine that leaves little excitement for either partner. Switching up these bonding activities makes couples feel younger and more in sync. Fun activities could be anything from taking a dance class together to learning how to make sushi.
Learn how to fight fair
Every couple argues. However, happier couples tend to listen more while respecting the other person’s opinions. Don’t degrade your spouse’s point of view, but listen completely before sharing yours. After both attitudes are in the open, calmly come to a decision that best fits both sides.
Change as individuals, change as a couple
After 20 years of marriage, it is inevitable that people change. In fact, change is important in a relationship. Just make sure that you change as a couple as well. Use open communication about daily concerns and don’t expect your partner to be the same person he or she was 20 years ago.
Accept nature
Staying married into your elderly years demands respect. However, with this older age comes a level of vulnerability that may not have been present throughout a partner’s life. A successful relationship accepts the changes during the aging years. Share thoughts and dreams for the coming years while focusing on enjoying life together in the present.
A long-term relationship is a source of pride, especially today. FirstLight Home Care is proud to be able to help happy couples age gracefully and independently, together."
555,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/secrets-to-living-a-longer-life/,"How can I live longer? It’s an age-old question that everyone asks themselves onetime or another in their lifetime. Whether you have had a recent health scare or simply want to live a healthier life, there are plenty of things you can do live a longer life. The great news is that you don’t need to make drastic changes to your life in order to live longer; rather, you can make small changes to the way you live each day which over time will make a huge impact on your life. Below are a few key tips that you can incorporate into your day-to-day life to help you live a longer, and more importantly, happier life.
Exercise
This one’s obvious but nonetheless important. If you stay active, you will live longer, it’s as simple as that. Exercise reduces the probability of heart disease, weight gain, and even depression. But what you may not know is that you don’t have to work out like an olympic athlete to reap the life extending benefits of exercise. People who maintain a low intensity workout regimen throughout their life can get all the life saving benefits that exercise provides. Furthermore, a low intensity workout regimen is easier to maintain, making it less likely for people to quit.
Rethink The Way You Eat
Ever wonder why people in remote areas of the world consistently live to be over 100? Their diet plays a big role. These people live by a few adages that you can easily put into your diet to live longer. The first is to eat until you’re 80% full. This way you can control your portions and maintain your weight and nutritional balance easier. The second is to eat more during the morning and decrease your food intake in each meal following. Not only will you feel healthier, but you will reduce the urge to eat late at night which usually consists of foods that are detrimental to your health.
Build Your Social Network
Now don’t go on Facebook and start adding hundreds of “friends”. By building your social network we mean building a network of friends and family that can rely on each other through the ups and downs of life. Having friends and family you can rely on not only relieves stress when you are in need of help, but studies show that by simply being there for others you will have a better outlook on life as well. By helping others, you give yourself purpose which lifts your mood and gives you a more positive perception of the future.
Find Purpose
Much like being there for your social network, having a purpose can play a vital role in the longevity of your life. Find a hobby, seek out your dream job, give time to those who are less fortunate than you. No matter what it is, it is important to have something in your life that makes you excited to hop out of bed each morning. A great way to tackle this is to write your life’s mission statement. What do you want to achieve in life, where do you want to go, who do you want to be? Then, create a list of how you can achieve these dreams. Simply putting your goals and aspirations on paper can give you the lift you need to find your purpose in life and lift your mood and optimism for the future. The key is to never lose your childlike curiosity.
Relieve Stress
Stress is king when it comes to breaking our bodies down. Even a small stressor like
traffic can slowly build up and make us tense and anxious. By relieving stress you will see a major improvement in your day-to-day health, which in turn will improve your health
in the long run. Great stress relievers include mindful yoga, peaceful walks in the park, and even talking with friends. The key is to find a way to unwind each day and not let the little things pile up."
556,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/senior-activities/,"When you think of an activity night for seniors, bingo is always the first thought that comes to mind. But did you know there are other great activities that seniors can do to improve happiness and build friendships? Seniors activities are great for improving cognitive ability, building social interactions, and keeping active and healthy. From dances to field trips, there are a wide range of great activities for seniors that can bring more laughter and fun into their lives. Below we have listed some of our favorite activities for seniors.
Dancing
Noting keeps you youthgul and happy quite like dancing. Remember the fun and excitement of school dances as a kid? No matter what age you are, you can always boogie down to some great music with your friends. Dancing helps seniors stay active while having a great time with friends and loved ones. Even for those who can’t dance like they used to, enjoying music with friends and letting loose can do wonders for their mood.
Field Trips
One of the worst things a senior can do is stay immobile in their homes. A simple field trip to a museum or park can do wonders for their health, plus it gives them an opportunity to learn something new and share an experience with their friends and family. When considering a good field trip, look for local events in their community that aren’t too crowded or expensive. Sometimes getting out of the house is all you need to lighten up your day, and it’s never too late to learn something new.
Karaoke
Seniors across the country are belting tunes with the help of Karaoke. This is a great activity for seniors of all singing abilities as it’s fun to let loose and sing in front of your friends and family. For seniors who have been life long singers, Karaoke is also a great way for them to display their talent and maintain their hobby in a fun and interactive manner. Karaoke machines have become very inexpensive in recent years and are a great way to bring people together for great music, fun, and a little laughter.
Virtual Bowling
Recent advancements have made video games more accessible than ever for seniors. One of the most popular of these games is virtual bowling on the Wii. What makes this game so great is that seniors can play in the comfort of their own home with friends and family, plus it gives them the opportunity to stay active all year long. Wii consoles and games have become much more affordable in recent years and have proven to be a great form of entertainment for people of all ages and abilities.
Fitness
As mentioned before, keeping active is vital to a senior’s health, but not all fitness has to be boring. Fitness activities like water aerobics and yoga have been modified to allow seniors to receive an excellent source of fitness without worry of injury or overexerting themselves. These activities are also a great way for seniors to get out of their homes and enjoy quality time with their friends in a new atmosphere. Go to any water aerobics class and you will see the wide smiles and playful laughter that radiate the room."
557,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/senior-bone-health-2/,"According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation, 15% of all women will break a bone in their lifetime. And the risk of breaking a bone increases dramatically as one ages, from 3 in 1,000 at age 55 to 45 in 1,000 at age 75. Thus, this is a major health risk for post-menopausal women. All signs indicate that bone health will continue its climb up the popularity ladder as the U.S. population ages and lives longer.
In 2015 the health trend everyone will be talking about will be bone health. It’s one that if you start early (or even start today) will help you reduce your likelihood of having weak and brittle bones and less susceptible to osteoporosis (or its precursor osteopenia).
The key to bone health is to start today to keep them healthy. Here are 5 tips to increase bone strength:
- Start young. Bones reach peak density when you’re in your 20’s. If you’re saying “too late” and are going to stop reading this blog post…don’t lose hope. You can start today to improve the health and strength of your bones. Talk with your doctor or a nutritionist about your diet and getting enough calcium and vitamin D in the foods you eat.
- Know your T-Score. Osteoporosis is often called a “silent disease” because you won’t display obvious, outward symptoms until a bone breaks—not a sign you want to wait for. A bone mineral density (BMD) test can tell you how strong your bones are.
- Don’t smoke and limit your drinking and meat in moderation. This is the answer to everything…moderation. Definitely don’t smoke. Smoking increases the rate of bone loss.
- Stay active. Weight bearing exercises strengthen bones by stimulating bone-building cells called osteoblasts.
- Recognize that genetics play a role in your bone health: Yes, there is only so much we can do to help keep our bones strong. Our bones will be developed based on the genetics of our folks. Genes determine a lot of factors that affect your overall bone health—including your bone size, bone mass, when you’ll go through menopause, and how well your body uses calcium and vitamin D. These traits are passed down from father to son and mother to daughter. By knowing your family history, you can take appropriate steps to intervene, including earlier screening and use of medication.
Join us on Facebook throughout 2015 as we discuss with #NurseGina ways to improve our bone health/strength, exercise tips, and other recommendations to help prevent the onset of osteoporosis."

As people age, their bones become more brittle, and fractures could lead to great pain, loss of mobility or force people into assisted living. Fractures can also require surgery, such as hip replacement, which can lead to additional complications.
Maintaining bone health is also important because osteoporosis is a disease that sneaks up on people and often times has no symptoms until a fracture occurs.
Adopting healthy personal habits is important for people to avoid having brittle bones and protect themselves from the consequences of poor bone health.
1. Get Enough Calcium and Vitamin D
Eating right is extremely important to maintaining strong bones. Calcium consumption is important to reduce vulnerability to osteoporosis. Calcium is found in dairy products, vegetables like broccoli and kale. Many foods like orange juice, nuts and tofu are often enriched with calcium.
Vitamin D is also important because it helps the body absorb calcium. Sunlight helps the body create vitamin D, but there are also food sources like salmon, eggs and liver.
If eating all of those healthy options sounds like a bummer, there are lots of other options available. The variety of bone-healthy meals seems endless. Here are some ideas:
- Honey glazed salmon: Salmon fillets are a great source of vitamin D and don’t take much preparation.
- Wheat pasta with sun-dried tomatoes: Wheat pasta provides calcium.
- Macaroni and cheese: This comfort food can be made healthier by using whole wheat macaroni and low-fat cheese.
- Apricot and yogurt parfait: Just in case you’re craving a calcium-rich desert.
2. Cut out Drinking and Smoking
Lifestyle choices beyond diet also influence bone health. For instance, there are studies that show a correlation between tobacco use and decreased bone density. It’s important to know that smoking does have an impact:
- The longer a person smokes, the higher the risk of fractures in old age.
- Smokers take longer to heal from a fracture.
- Secondhand smoke may increase a person’s risk of low bone mass.
- Quitting smoking may reduce the risk of fracture.
Chronic alcohol consumption is also linked with an increase of bone fracture. Alcohol interferes with calcium balance in the body and affects hormones and vitamins, which are healthy for bones. Alcohol can also disrupt someone’s balance and cause them to fall, which can also lead to fractures.
3. Exercise to Increase Bone Density and Strength
Bone is similar to muscle in that it becomes stronger in response to exercise. People who exercise at young ages achieve greater bone mass, and regular exercise allows people to maintain strength, coordination and balance, which can prevent falls.
People who dislike exercising may not realize that there are a variety of physical activities they can do to help build bone strength. Activities include weight training, walking, hiking, jogging, dancing, tennis and stair climbing. Exercises that force a person to bear weight and work against gravity work better at building strong bones.
Before beginning an exercise program, a person should consult with their doctor to find out which ones are safest for them to try. The goal is to get in at least a half hour most days, if not daily.
4. Get a Bone Density Test
A bone density test will tell seniors if they have normal bone density or if they are at risk of breaking a bone. It can help your doctor determine how likely you are to break a bone and take measures to help prevent doing so. Doctors can also determine if things their patients are doing to promote good bone health are working. People who should think about bone density tests are:
- Woman 65 or older and men 70 or older
- Menopausal women or post-menopausal women
- Anyone who has broken a bone after age 50
Bone density tests are painless, non-invasive and quick. Tests involve an X-ray machine. A person needs a prescription to have the procedure done.
5. Avoid Falls
The best way to avoid a fracture is by avoiding a fall. While that is easier said than done, there are things seniors can do in their everyday lives to reduce the risk:
- Have eyes checked and keep eyeglass prescriptions up to date.
- Keep rooms free of clutter.
- Remove slippery rugs or carpets.
- Wear shoes with rubber soles and great traction.
Seniors should do everything they can to protect their bone health.
Although there is no cure for osteoporosis, it can be treated and prevented. There are also medicines on the market that doctors can prescribe, but they may come with side effects.
Sometimes the solution to a problem can cause problems in itself. For example, hip replacement may be required after a hip fracture, but some hip implants can cause complications.
Hundreds of people have filed lawsuits against Stryker after a hip implant caused them additional injuries.
The best plan is to build strong bones and thus avoid fractures and surgery. When it comes to bone health and fractures, prevention is definitely the best medicine.

For those who are challenged by vision impairment, taking part in summer activities may be more challenging. Fortunately, if you are a senior caregiver or companion you can help. Today there are a variety of options that will help your loved one continue to live out his or her life to the fullest despite limitations.
One of my favorite resources, The Savvy Senior, offers some great tips on coping with low vision. Did you know that according to the National Eye Institute, 3.3 million Americans age 40 and older currently live with low vision or blindness—and that number is expected to double over the next 30 years? Those who are affected can often sink into depression, suffer hip fractures or falls and often become socially isolated.
At FirstLight Home Care, our companion providers are dedicated to helping seniors cope through the trying time of vision loss. And while there may be no easy solutions for the problem, we can certainly help brighten their lives. How can you do the same?
Rehab Ready: Vision rehabilitation services can help your loved one see the light when it comes to their vision impairment. Today there are hundreds of vision rehabilitation agencies and clinics across the country that can aid families and caregivers alike. While rehab services can not restore lost eyesight, it can help your love ones maximize their remaining vision while equipping them with the tools and techniques that will allow them to live more independently—regardless of if they are seeking in-home care or not.
Available Resources: Many support programs are available in areas across the country. The nonprofit organization Lighthouse International provides easy ways to search for help on its comprehensive website. For caregivers who can’t locate vision rehabilitation or support services, the American Foundation for the Blind created a special site for senior seniors with low vision. Additionally, the nonprofit public charity of VisionAWARE offers a slew of information including videos and articles providing everyday solutions to living with vision loss. As a caregiver, find helpful tips for adapting a home to make it safer and easier to navigate as well as advice on traveling safely outside of the home.

560,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/senior-care-to-keep-parents-active/,"Grieving the loss of a parent is more than difficult, and seeing your living parent live
alone can also be hard. Many times, your living parent is still able to take care of him or herself and moving into an assisted living center is out of the question.
In a situation like this, it may become a responsibility of yours to
help keep your parent active. With the hustle and bustle of your own life, including children and work, this can be a very difficult task and much guilt may start to arise.
It is important to remember that as it is necessary to help keep your parent involved and active, they still respectfully want space and want you to continue enjoying life. Below is a list of ways to find a happy medium, help your parent stay active without it becoming too much in your own life.
Find out what interests they have. Possibly your parent likes to play cards or bingo. In that case, find a senior living group that provides these activities.
- Sign up for water exercise. Many local exercise facilities have water exercise, which is a fabulous way to meet people and great for your health!
- Gardening can be a family affair. Everyone loves to be outside in the fresh air. Gardening can be dangerous, as your parent ages, so help out, start a
small garden and make it easy to maintain.
- Send crafts and cards from the kids! Parents (grandparents) love this! Even if home, a sweet card in the mail will brighten their day.
- Help them join a breakfast group. There is nothing better than starting the day chatting with a group of friends over a cup of coffee. This is very popular among
seniors, and in most local diners you will find groups of seniors that are ready for more!
- Include them on family vacations. If you are taking yourself and/or the kids somewhere fun, let your parent come along! This may sound stressful, and isn’t always the best idea when traveling. However, if you decide to do this, chose a resort that has activities for all ages.
- Make a memory book. Collect pictures and anything else of importance and create a scrapbook for your parent. The enjoyable memories can be used for lifelong entertainment.
- Find a friend. Love ones that live close would be more than happy to stop in and say hello. Don’t be afraid to ask those around you to be aware that your parent is alone and a quick visit or phone call would be much appreciated by all.
- Call. Parents love to hear from their children. Make sure to make that important phone call whenever you can, and keep them well informed as to what is going on in the family’s life. Make sure to say, “I love you” and find out if there is anything he/she may need.
Sometimes it is easy to continue life and forget how important it is to be there for a parent that is alone. Remind yourself of all they have done for you through the years and embrace them in these years when they need you most."
561,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/senior-citizen-exercising/,"During the winter months, exercising is the last thing many of us want to do. Although, we all know how important it is to continue to stay active, and a good exercise regime year
around will help maintain a healthy lifestyle. With that said, it isn’t only important for you to continue to exercise but to make sure it is a goal for your aging parent as well. This is an even trickier battle, since the winter months can be dangerous, and going outside isn’t always the best plan. “A regular exercise program is the best available prescription for independent, active and healthy aging”, according to the AARP, the National Institute on Aging and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A large health study reported in 2011 suggests that all adults — including seniors — can benefit from as little as 15 minutes per day of moderately heart-pumping exercise. About 30 minutes is the official
recommendation, in addition to at least two sessions per week of muscle-strengthening activity or exercise (www.livestrong.com).
Here is what is essential for your parent to be fitted for an exercise regime-one that will be easy for he/she to follow and maintain, all the while keeping it fun!
- Find out what may interest them. They may want to do something as simple as
walk in place while they watch the news. Others parents may want to spice it up a bit and learn a new dance. If water aerobics is something that interests them, it may be worth it to help them get to a class once or twice a week.
- Provide them with the tools they need. A must, is a set of light weight dumbbells. You can also find great workout videos out there for all age levels. Help them find comfortable clothes and shoes to wear during their exercise routines. If they look good, they will feel good!
- Set up a plan. Find a professional that can help write out a daily workout schedule. Having a plan to follow will most definitely keep the motivation going. It may be a good idea to coordinate a personal training session with that professional from time to time.
- Coordinate group exercise. Sometimes it is more fun to workout in groups. Plus, know that others are depending on you will prevent your parent from quitting. Try to form a group that gets together once a week for your parent to join. Even set it up at their home if there is room and leaving isn’t an option.
- Create an emergency plan. Exercise, as valuable as it is, can be dangerous
amongst the aging. This is extremely true when exercise is being done at the home, alone. It would be beneficial and safe for your parent to have an emergency plan in place. For example, have your parent make a quick phone call to you or another loved one, letting them know they are starting their workout regime for that day.
There is so much evidence that supports exercise as you age. It helps your heart, lungs, bones, muscles, brain, and everything in between. Take the time to make exercise a goal in your life and let that shine through to your parent. This is a valuable way to spend time with your loved one all the while keeping them safe, active, and healthy."
562,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/senior-citizen-scams/,"No one is immune to scams, but it seems the elderly are particularly targeted. My Dad was a very savvy 75-year-old accountant. His mind was extremely sharp before he passed away, but his financial judgments were slightly slipping. He was extremely charitable, donating to many causes – he was always taken in by sad stories.
Therefore, I was not surprised when he told me he had “adopted a family” in Nigeria. Every month he sent them a set amount, but then the disasters started and they needed more money for hospital and medical bills. How could he not help a 5-year-old girl suffering from asthma? A Father who contracted pneumonia? Or a Mother who was having another baby? We tried to explain to him that he was being conned, but he ignored our concerns. When all was said and done, he was scammed for more than $15,000.
In comparison to many senior citizens, he got off easy – FBI statistics show that more than $30 million is lost to scammers. This number is severely underreported, because many senior citizens do not want to admit they were duped. The Federal Trade Commission estimates that nearly 25 million Americans are victims of consumer fraud each year. Studies have shown that senior citizens are more at risk to be targeted by telemarketing scams than other age groups, and fraudulent telemarketers direct anywhere from 56 to 80 percent of their calls at older Americans.
So how do you help the elderly from telemarketing scams versus legitimate offers? The best way is to be educated consumers. According to the National Prime Convention Council and FBI, here’s some tips to avoid senior scams:
- Personal Information. Never divulge any personal information such as a social security number, credit card information or bank account information to unknown or unfamiliar companies.
- Vacation/Travel offers. If an offer seems to be too good to be true, it probably is. You may get calls promising fantastic trips or prizes. To claim the prize, you need to pay a fee up front. When the prize arrives, it is a cheap trinket. Be extremely wary of time shares.
- Credit cards. If you have a bad credit history, you may be offered a credit card
for an advance fee. However, the credit card never appears.
- Work at home. With many people starting their own businesses at home, it’s hard to weed through the legitimate work at home offers. Too often you are asked to pay for training or materials upfront, and either the materials never arrive, or there are no customers for the services.
- Phishing. You may get an email that looks like it came from your bank or financial institution, telling you that you need to update your information or your account is in jeopardy. Next thing you know, you are a victim of identity theft.
- Foreign Lotteries. You may be asked to buy tickets for a foreign lottery with a
large jackpot. Unfortunately, either there is no lottery or you never receive a
ticket. It is illegal to promote a foreign lottery in the United States.
- Pyramid Schemes. You may be asked to recruit members in exchange for big profits. Most multilevel marketing plans that do not actually sell goods or services
quickly fall apart.
- Charity scams. A natural disaster occurs and you get a letter/call/email asking you to donate. Unfortunately, the victims never receive the funds. Find out what
percentage of the money is paid in commissions and what percentage actually
goes to the charity or investment.
- Investment schemes. These may include advance fee schemes, prime bank note schemes, pyramid schemes, and Nigerian letter fraud schemes. Please visit the Common Fraud Schemes webpage for more information about these crimes and tips for protecting yourself from them.
Remember, anyone with a telephone, cell phone, computer or mailbox can be a victim. Because, senior citizens often have a “nest egg,” to own their home, and/or to have excellent credit—they are more susceptible to con artists.
As an adult daughter, if I was more educated, I could have saved my father money and misery! We need to protect our parents and even elderly scams from our grandparents!"
563,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/senior-companionship-building-relationships-later-life/,"February. It’s a month that’s traditionally focused on love and relationships. But for older adults, maintaining relationships can be difficult. Often, they’re coping with the loss of a spouse or partner, shrinking social circles or family they can’t easily visit. Aging in place often means living alone, and older adults who live on their own without regular human interactions can feel isolated. That’s why some seek to form relationships with peers who have similar interests. This may be as simple as finding a casual friendship or someone to meet for a recreational activity. Or, sometimes, it could mean dating and even marriage.
Aging in place doesn’t have to be lonely. And finding ways to maintain relationships throughout the years can have lasting benefits.
Investing in Your Health
No matter what your age, strong personal connections and deep human bonds are essential to happiness and emotional wellbeing. According to the Mayo Clinic, meaningful friendships can also be good for your health, reducing the risk of high blood pressure and an unhealthy body mass index (BMI). Numerous studies, including this one published in the American Journal of Public Health, suggest that older adults with larger social networks experience better cognitive health and have improved memory. And they even live longer than their peers with fewer social interactions.
Making New Friends
You’re never too old to make new friends. But even if you were a social butterfly in your younger years, you might be hesitant to reach out to people now that you’re older. AARP has some great tips for helping older adults make connections. Or you can consider one of these outlets for meeting new people:
- Pursue a hobby. Join an art class, cooking group or book club.
- Stay fit. Try a bowling league, walking group or dance lessons.
- Have faith. Make connections at your place of worship.
- Check out a senior center. Many offer a variety of activities geared to different interests and designed to bring people together.
- Volunteer. Share your time with a worthwhile cause in your community.
Creating and maintaining new friendships takes some initiative. And it might require you to step out of your comfort zone. But the results can be rewarding and can truly enhance quality of life for older adults.
Keeping the Old
Another way for older adults to enhance their social networks is by reconnecting with old friends with whom they’ve lost touch. It’s not unusual for people who were once great friends to just pick up where they left off, no matter how much time has gone by. These are often people – former classmates, neighbors, co-workers – with whom you already have a connection through shared experiences or similar interests. And don’t forget about cherished family, too. When was the last time you invited your favorite cousin for a visit to reminisce over old family photo albums? Or enjoyed a recreational activity with a former partner-in-crime? Reuniting with friends and family from your past can make you happier today.
Finding Love Again
Some older adults might be looking for a more significant relationship. If you’ve been widowed or divorced, maybe you’re longing to make a romantic connection, to find someone with whom to spend your golden years. Some people see this time in life as a second chance for love. That may mean reconnecting with past partners or finding loving companionship with a friend who is also widowed or divorced.
Those who are not sure where to start looking for love sometimes turn to online dating websites geared specifically for older adults. If you rely on the Internet to make a connection, however, beware of red flags that can signal someone isn’t truly interested in your affection.
Making Connections at Any Age
Regardless of whether you’re looking for love or simply looking for a friend or companion, making connections and nurturing fulfilling relationships is as important in your 60s, 70s, 80s and beyond as it was in your youth – if not more.
Opening yourself to new human connections can start with something as simple as a regular visit with someone who can share a conversation and provide a listening ear. This month of love and relationships could be a great time to reconnect, expand your social circle and seek out the companionship that will enhance your quality of life as you age.

564,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/senior-exercise/,"Every now and then we have to admit that we can’t do all of the physical exercise that we did when we were younger. Thankfully, walking is one form of exercise that most of us can do throughout our life. Not only will walking help you to slow down the aging process, but you will help you feel more energetic and better about yourself. So lace up your walking shoes and check out the health and aging benefits of walking:
- Walking can reduce your stroke risks: According to University of South Carolina researchers, walking briskly for just 30 minutes, five days a week can significantly lower your risk of suffering a stroke.
- Walking can save your mind: Researchers from the Mayo Client have seen improvement in people suffering from memory problems when they partake in moderate activities. This could be the result of the role physical activity plays in increasing blood flow to the brain.
- Walking can save you money: By walking outdoors and not in a gym, you will not insure the cost of monthly gym fees. Plus, depending on where you live and the temperature at this time of year, walking will get you out and about so you can take advantage of the scenery.
- Walking can prevent or manage various conditions, including heart disease, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes.
- Walking can lift your mood, and improve your balance and coordination.
If you walk as part of your daily exercise regimen – where do you walk? And, how far each day? Write a comment and join our conversation."

If you find yourself stopping over more often to check on your aging parents or other family members, now may be the time to look at senior home care options.
During National Home Care and Family Caregivers Month, we want to recognize the more than 50 million family caregivers across America, according to AARP. Family caregivers investing their time is admirable and fulfilling. As your parents cared for and supported you, you’re now returning the love you’ve received over the years. Eventually, you might begin to feel stress and frustration as you’re spending more time with them while the rest of your life feels out of balance. Sadly, your loved one is probably also feeling the strain as they worry about their inability to live independently.
If you notice that mom, dad or another at-risk family member requires more support than you can provide, what do you do?
Signs It Might Be Time To Consider Senior Home Care & Caregiver Services
When your loved one’s needs have extended beyond a little bit of extra support, it’s a good time to consider in-home care. Here are some specific signs to look for as family caregivers:
They Need Help with Personal Hygiene
If you’re noticing a change in your loved one’s dressing or bathing habits, it could be an early sign of a decline in their health, particularly for those with dementia.
They’re Not Safe on Their Own
Potential safety issues are another warning sign it’s time to consider senior home care. Situations like multiple slips and falls, worsening health conditions, chronic forgetfulness or not eating regularly can be red flags that professional care is needed.
They’re Missing Doctor’s Appointments
With age, comes more visits to the doctor. If, however, your loved one is missing appointments because it’s not safe for them to drive, then consider an in-home care professional to help with transportation.
They’re Bored and Lonely
Chronic isolation has a negative impact on physical, emotional and mental health. If you struggle to carve out enough time in your day to keep your loved one engaged and in good company, it’s time to consider an in-home caregiver. Companion care can include visiting with your loved one, playing games or cards and having a meal together.
You’re Seeing Changes in Their Personality
If a loved one is acting differently or seems “off,” it could be a sign of a more serious underlying condition. You might start to notice it in the form of erratic behavior, withdrawal from social conversation or trouble with basic housekeeping and maintenance.
You Can’t Keep Up
There are only so many hours in each day. Family caregivers have so much to balance. It’s hard to keep up with your own family and home, as well as your loved one’s. If it’s becoming increasingly difficult and exhausting to keep up with, consider hiring senior home care.
Factors To Consider When Looking For A Home Care Agency
Caring for the people you love can be an honor, but it can quickly become an overwhelming task, too. It’s natural to want your loved ones to have the best possible care and passing that responsibility to someone else can involve some hard decisions.
Here are a few things to keep in mind while researching care for your parents:
Assess their current needs
The first step to keep in mind is what your parents need physically and mentally. It’s not uncommon for seniors to require a little extra assistance for day-to-day tasks, but are they struggling more with a specific task? What about their mental health? Do you find your parent is becoming forgetful, or maybe even lonely?
There are multiple caregiving options available (personal care, memory care, companion care, travel care), so it’s important to take note of your parent’s needs before choosing a home care service.
Look for an extraordinary caregiver
It can be difficult to accept the fact that you need to find extra care for your parents because you can’t do it all yourself. While researching care for your parents, take time to look for a caregiver who is patient, compassionate, detail-oriented and present.
How To Talk To Your Parents About Home Care
Because this is National Home Care and Family Caregivers Month, we want to highlight useful tips to help you to start the home care conversation with your loved ones:
Do not wait for a crisis to start the conversation.
Start talking about home care solutions now so that you can ask your loved one how they would like to address the issue when the time comes.
Address your concerns.
Be open and honest with your feelings and the challenges you have juggling your home life, career and their care. According to a recent study by Genworth, 55 percent of Americans say being a burden on their family is their biggest concern regarding long-term care issues. Take this into consideration when approaching your parent about accepting in-home help.
Show Empathy.
Change is scary. When talking with your parents, try to understand how they could be feeling. It is important to realize that this change may feel like they are losing control of their independence. By showing empathy and listening to them, it will allow for a conversation to occur where you can discuss alternatives that help them retain what control they have left.
Focus on the advantages and benefits.
Any conversation you have about caregiving should focus on why home care is a good thing. Instead of concentrating on why your loved one needs assistance, point out the benefits of having a caregiver there to support their personal needs and care.
Explore home care options together.
Include your aging parents in the process of finding the best solutions for them. Allow them to be a part of the decision-making process. Let them look at the options and even meet with the home care company prior to making any final decisions.
Test the waters.
Try hiring an outside caregiver for in-home help on a short-term basis for your respite care. This provides an opportunity to show your parents that having a caregiver is not something to fear and often leads to them being open to receiving ongoing care.

566,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/senior-isolation-helping-seniors-stay-engaged/,"Watching an elderly loved one struggle with senior isolation is a heartbreaking experience. You want to give them the care and attention they need. However, with your own personal and work obligations, it can feel like an impossible situation.
Now, in the age of COVID-19, you have the added risk of potentially exposing them if they have yet to be vaccinated. As a result, while your loved one has been staying inside to stay safe, they’ve been cut off from socialization and stimulation.
This has come at a cost for so many seniors in the form of unhealthy isolation. In fact, according to the National Poll on Healthy Aging, recently conducted by the University of Michigan, loneliness among older adults has doubled during the pandemic. In June 2018, 27% of people over 50 years old said they sometimes or often felt isolated from others. By June 2020, that number soared to 56%.
While isolation impacts the social and emotional health of seniors, it also has physical implications. It’s been linked to a weaker immune system, an escalation of Alzheimer’s disease symptoms, overall cognitive decline, cancer, obesity, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and more.
As both the pandemic and winter continue on, it’s vitally important to support the social and emotional needs of the seniors in your life. How can you do that, while keeping them safe? Below are some tips to consider.
Tap the Power of Technology to Prevent Senior Isolation
If your loved one isn’t familiar with a smartphone or tablet, it can be an intimidating experience. However, now’s a good time for them to learn. It can truly open up a whole new world, one filled with podcasts, videos, movies, games and more.
It can also help them stay in touch with family and friends through emailing, texting, video calls and on social media. If they’re interested, work with them to set up a Facebook profile and show them how to use it. They’ll have a chance to regularly see pictures and videos of those they know and love, like their grandchildren, which will be immensely encouraging. If they’d prefer to text or email, show them how and then schedule regular times for family members to reach out.
Connect Without Technology
If your senior prefers a different way to connect to avoid isolation, there are still many options. You can pick up the phone and spend some time updating them on work, your kids or a new recipe you tried. You don’t need to have deep conversations every day. Just setting aside some regular time to chat with them for just a few minutes will make a world of difference. Besides the phone, consider writing a letter or having grandchildren draw pictures, write notes and cards to brighten their day.
Help Them Stay Mentally Fit
Senior isolation can also lead to cognitive decline. It’s why engagement is so important. To promote mental engagement, you can purchase playing cards, crossword puzzles, jigsaw puzzles or Sudoku for your family member. If they’re online, there are endless apps and games to explore. If there’s a place they’ve always wanted to travel to, encourage them to go online and learn about it. They can visit museums, national parks, cities and even go on safaris, all virtually, from the comfort of their own home.
In addition, reading and writing are other ways to stay mentally fit and stimulate the imagination, while offering respite from the dreariness of winter. Regularly bring your loved one books from authors they enjoy and if they like to write, provide them with a journal, too. If they have a hard time reading, set them up so they can listen to books or even podcasts. There are many new releases every day, covering a range of topics, from cooking and politics to true crime and spirituality.
Help Them Stay Physically Fit
Movement is another key to remaining healthy and active. It releases endorphins, reduces stress and can improve mental health. It also gets blood flowing and increases flexibility and strength.
It’s why, if their condition allows it, you should encourage your loved one to stay active physically with exercise. This can include anything from a couple of 10-minute walks each day, gently stretching or doing yoga to taking advantage of exercise videos on YouTube. There are also many virtual exercise classes offered at local gyms. Just make sure whatever your loved one is doing, it’s at a pace that’s comfortable and healthy for them.
If weight is an issue, it needs to be addressed. Many people cope with stress by eating, which can lead to an unhealthy weight gain. If your loved one is dealing with this, talk to them about working with their medical provider to begin a healthy diet.
Encourage a Sense of Purpose
Having a sense of purpose each day is vital for healthy living. Yet, this can be difficult for seniors who are isolated. To help your loved one through this, encourage them to try out new hobbies that interest them. It can be anything from knitting to scrapbooking to playing bridge.
Another way is to volunteer to share their skills from home. For example, there are agencies that offer opportunities for mentoring relationships with students through local colleges. You can use the U.S. Administration on Aging’s Eldercare Locator website to find such opportunities in your area.
They can also sign up for a class to learn a new skill, like a second language. There are many online options for continuing education, whether through a local institution or a national or international one. Some are even free.
Keep Up on Wellness Checks
While months of social distancing may prevent the spread of COVID-19, it’s now created a situation where many older adults aren’t getting the care they need to diagnose new conditions and manage existing ones. This can cause a minor issue to escalate into a life-threatening one. To avoid this, make sure your loved one is keeping regular doctors appointments.
Consider a Pet to Prevent Senior Isolation
If your loved one is able to care for a pet, an adult cat or dog could bring some joy and purpose to their life. It will also require more activity, which can promote a better sense of physical and mental well-being. If a pet isn’t an option, consider pet therapy. It’s proven to lower anxiety and blood pressure, improve memory and contribute to an overall sense of well-being.

567,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/senior-loved-ones-eye-check/,"Seniors are especially susceptible to problems with their eyes making life even more difficult, especially if they have mobility issues. This year, start early and make an appointment now to have your senior loved one’s eyes checked during the American Academy of Ophthalmology’s Healthy Aging Month in September. A senior eye check by a professional could make a huge difference in their quality of life.
Many times seniors don’t even realize their eyesight is getting worse, so early detection and intervention of eye problems is extremely important. As a caregiver, you may be the first one to notice changes in behavior or mobility related to eyesight limitations. Here are some early warning signs that a senior’s eyesight may be getting worse:
Light sensitivity
If a senior complains about the sun or bright lights it can mean something more serious and should be checked by an ophthalmologist.
Very dry eyes
This can be very painful and lead to red, irritated eyes. There are medications that can help, but dry eyes do need to be examined by a professional.
Eyes that tear up
Conversely, eyes that tear up and appear watery can also signal a medical problem. An eye doctor can determine the cause and suggest a treatment.
Eyes that appear cloudy
This can mean the start of cataracts, a serious condition that happens with age. Luckily cataracts can be removed with laser surgery and the results are usually very good.
Glaucoma
Unfortunately Glaucoma have very few symptoms and having an eye pressure test is the only way to be sure. This is why a yearly test by a professional is so important.
Drooping eyelids
This is a common problem that occurs as we age, but it can interfere with the ability to see. If severe, eyelids can fall into the eye socket and cause pain and irritation. Surgery is the only way to correct this.
Seniors can lose their ability to walk, hear and taste as they age, and one of the ways they can stay active and communicate with the world around them is through sight. As caregivers and companions to seniors across the nation, FirstLight Home Care encourages anyone who cares for a senior to make sure they get their eyes examined by a professional in September. You can see the other eye health observances on the American Academy of Ophthalmology website."
568,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/senior-safety-tips-for-the-home/,"National Senior Citizens Day is a time set aside to recognize our older population. Celebrated on August 21st, this day is meant to show appreciation to those who have worked, achieved, sacrificed and accomplished so much to make our lives and our world a better place.
If you have a loved one who’s older, one way to help show your gratitude is by making their home safer – so they can live more independently – with these senior safety tips:
Tip #1: Eliminate Fall Hazards
Falls are one of the biggest safety threats to seniors. In fact, on average, one third of adults over the age of 65 fall in their home each year, leading to an injury or disability. It’s why removing slippery area rugs, installing grab bars in the shower and tub, and making sure they have proper-fitting shoes are so important. In addition, install extra lighting throughout their home and place anti-slip adhesive stair treads and a sturdy railing at each staircase.
Tip #2: Improve Bathroom Safety for Your Senior
One area that can lead to slips, trips, falls and other issues is the bathroom. Beyond grab bars in the shower and tub, add traction with skid-proof mats or anti-slip adhesive treads. There are even anti-slip formulas, which are liquid-based coatings that can be applied to the shower or tub floor for permanent traction.
Also, place a non-skid bath rug outside the tub and shower area for them to step onto once they’re done bathing. It will help avoid slipping and absorb water drips.
Another way to improve bathroom safety is to install a nightlight that remains on overnight. This will offer some soft lighting that helps them navigate their way with more ease. In addition, lower your loved one’s water heater to 120 degrees or below to ensure they aren’t accidentally scalded.
Tip #3: Keep the Kitchen Safe
The kitchen is another room in the home where an elderly individual can get into trouble. Some ways to avoid safety issues for your senior include:
- Installing more overhead lighting
- Clearing up clutter on the floors
- Clearly marking the “on” and “off” buttons on the oven and stove
- Keeping hazardous items, like cleaning agents, away from where food is stored
Also aim to regularly check your loved one’s pantry and fridge to remove expired items and replace them with fresh foods.
Tip #4: Invest in a Medical Alert System
With a medical alert system, help is at your loved one’s fingertips. If there’s a fall, fire or other emergency, they can press a button, either around their neck or on their wrist. They are then connected to a 24/7 monitoring company for an immediate response.
Today, there are even systems that can tell if the individual has fallen, and there are panic buttons that can be installed in various rooms to serve the same purpose. Look for ones that are voice-activated.
Tip #5: Install a Home Security System
The elderly population is at a higher risk for home thefts and break-ins since they’re more vulnerable and often live alone. A security system can deter criminal activity and ensure your loved one is protected. They’ll also have a greater sense of well-being knowing their home is being monitored 24/7. For more comprehensive senior safety, there are even some systems that offer both medical alert and home security features.
Tip #6: Protect Your Loved One’s Identity
Seniors are also more susceptible to identify theft. In fact, there are even scammers who specifically target senior citizens since they aren’t as tech savvy as younger generations.
To keep your loved one safe, explain to them why they should never give out their credit card, Social Security number or other private details to a stranger, whether over the phone, via email or if someone comes knocking at their door. Educate them about common phone and online scams and invest in an identity protection theft program that will alert you if their identity has been compromised.
Tip #7: Manage Medications Carefully
If your loved one is on numerous medications, it can be difficult to manage them all. To avoid missed doses and related safety issues, review medications frequently. Make a schedule of each medication, when it is to be taken, at what dose and if they need to eat first.
Clearly label each one and dispose of those that have expired. If your loved one has a hard time reading fine print, ask their pharmacist to provide large print labels.
Pill organizers and medicine boxes can also prove invaluable when it comes to medication management. Today, there are even automatic pill dispensers you can purchase for the home that are controlled through an app.
Tip #8: Prepare for Emergencies
If there’s an emergency, such as a power outage, you want your loved one to be prepared, especially if they live alone. Create an easily accessible safety kit for your senior that includes:
- A flashlight with batteries
- A battery-operated radio
- Extra batteries for their hearing aid, flashlight and radio
- An extra pair of glasses and any extra medical equipment they may need
- A first aid kit that is fully stocked
- A list of prescription medications and dosage amounts, as well as the names and phone numbers of physicians and emergency contacts
In addition, install smoke and carbon monoxide detectors near the bedrooms in your loved one’s home and check them annually. It’s also important for them to have a working fire extinguisher on hand in the kitchen and know how to use it if they are able.
Tip #9: Hire a Companion to Keep Your Senior Safe
If your senior is still struggling with safety issues at home, consider hiring a home care companion. These are trained professionals who can help your loved one in a range of ways. For instance, they can aid with mobility, as well as bathing and dressing needs. They can also help with grocery shopping, meal preparation and housekeeping, as well as transportation and medication reminders.
Hiring a professional caregiver can provide you and your family with peace of mind knowing your loved one is in safe and caring hands when you’re not able to be with them. If you’re concerned about senior safety for your loved one, contact your local FirstLight® Home Care today. We offer skilled and compassionate caregivers who can step in and help in a range of ways."
569,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/senior-spring-maintenance/,"Spring will be here before we know it. In fact, the first day of Spring is Tuesday, March 20. And in a few days, Daylight Savings Time begins, clocks change, and some of us gain a little extra light in the evenings.
As the weather warms and things begin to thaw, there’s often a need to do some general spring maintenance. For aging seniors, some routine tasks around the home can be difficult to take on, especially if they have mobility issues. There are several ways you can assist your senior to help get their home ready for spring and ensure a safe, secure environment inside and out.
Here are 5 ways you can help your senior loved one with spring maintenance:
Inspect the medicine cabinet. This is a good time to go through your loved one’s medicine cabinet and purge any expired, unused medication. Also, be sure the medicines they take daily are stored properly – in a cool, dry, dark place. If you need information and tips on the safe disposal of medications, visit the U.S. Food & Drug Administration.
Change smoke detector batteries. Periodically checking smoke detectors, fire extinguishers and emergency kits is always a good idea. The U.S. Fire Administration recommends testing smoke detectors at least once a month, and batteries should be replaced at least twice a year. A good way to help remember to do this is to replace the batteries when you change your clocks for daylight saving time — when you spring forward or fall back.
Because smoke detectors are typically located on the ceiling or high on the wall, their location presents a fall hazard for the elderly. Helping your senior with this important task can reduce their fall risk.
Help with general cleaning. Spring is the perfect time to clean areas of the home that often are neglected. Clean window casings and baseboards, tops of cabinets and ceiling fans. Launder or dry-clean fabric draperies and clean wood and vinyl blinds. Vacuum upholstered furniture and get carpets professionally cleaned.
Clean up clutter. Cleaning up clutter should be part of an overall spring maintenance routine. Maintaining a clear walkway for seniors inside the home can help prevent falls. Pick up anything on the floor they could trip over, such as rugs and unnecessary furniture. If cords to lamps and other things become a tripping hazard, consider moving anything that is plugged in to a different area of the home.
Do a home safety check. It is important to make sure aging seniors living at home feel safe. In addition to de-cluttering and removing potential hazards in key areas of the home, it might be time to make some simple, inexpensive changes including:
- Adding secure railings to both sides of stairs, inside and outside the home.
- Making sure the home has adequate light by adding brighter bulbs to lamps, nightlights in hallways and motion lights around outdoor walkways.
- Adding grab bars inside and outside the tub or shower, as well as next to the toilet. Depending on need and mobility, consider adding a shower chair or installing a hand-held shower.
FirstLight Home Care can assist family caregivers and the seniors they care for with a variety of light housekeeping tasks, such as cleaning and changing smoke detector batteries, through our Companion Care Services. Our professional caregivers also provide Personal Care Services to aid and assist with the activities of daily living."
570,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/senior-vision/,"January is National Eye Care Month. Why is this health awareness holiday so important? The Vision Council of America notes that 12.2 million Americans require some sort of vision correction but don’t use any. Nearly 50% of parents with children under 12 have never taken their children to an eye care professional.
Your eyes are very important and you should take care of them. Here are some reasons why you should visit your eyecare professional and have an eye examination:
- Unexplained headaches. If you have been having unexplained, constant headaches, your solution could be visiting your optometrist. An eyecare professional can pinpoint the source of your headaches.
- Your eyes change over time. An optometrist can determine if you need eyeglasses or contact lenses, or if you need a stronger prescription to reduce eyestrain and to help you see better at close or far distances.
- Detect eye conditions. An optometrist is able to spot the early onset signs of diabetes, high blood pressure, glaucoma, and high cholesterol just by conducting an eye exam.
- Prevent conditions. Many serious eye diseases often have no symptoms. An optometrist will see the early signs of diseases, such as macular degeneration or cataracts. Early detection is important to prevent serious damage."
571,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/senior-winter-safety-tips-you-need-to-know-firstlight-home-care/,"Depending on where you live, the weather outside can get pretty frightful during the winter months. Plunging temperatures, snow and ice can pose problems both indoors and out. This can put older adults at a higher risk for injuries and other weather-related health issues. You can minimize cold-weather dangers simply by being prepared with safety tips for winter seasons. All it takes is a little planning and attention to your surroundings. Following are some winter safety tips for seniors—and their caregivers.
How To Minimize Risk With Winter Safety Tips For Seniors
Freezing temps bring snow and icy walkways, which can be extremely dangerous for elderly friends and family members. It’s important to be extra careful outdoors this time of year. Here are a few safety tips for winter season fall prevention:
Attraction to traction.
Make sure footwear is suitable for winter weather. Check the traction and fit. Consider anti-slip overshoes or use non-slip treads on your existing shoes. Lined boots with good traction will also keep you safe and warm.
The salt of the Earth.
It’s important to keep salt on hand so you can sprinkle it on walkways without having to risk a fall outside. Make sure the sidewalk, driveway, front walk and front steps are salted.
Get your grip!
Take advantage of railings and loved one’s arms when offered. This will keep you more stable as you make your way up and down stairs.
Take your time.
Hurrying when leaving your home, getting on and off the bus, crossing the street or unloading your car can put you at risk of falling. Take your time and pay attention to steps, curbs, ramps and patches of ice.
Strengthen your legs.
Exercise is one of the most important things you can do for fall prevention. Simple moves done in the home, even from a sitting position, will help build muscle and keep you steadier so you don’t lose your balance.
Most Common Causes of Injury For Seniors in Winter
While cold weather mishaps are not entirely avoidable, knowing what can cause injuries before they happen and winter safety tips to prevent them is half the battle. Below are more winter safety tips for seniors to help prevent injury:
Falling
Seniors are more prone to injury from a slip or fall. In fact, the CDC reports that falls are the leading cause of injury for adults ages 65 and older. Snow and ice can compound the problem, making even a simple walk to the mailbox treacherous. The best protection is to stay indoors when sidewalks and roads are covered in winter white.
Shoveling
Shoveling snow is a job everyone loves to hate. And for older adults, it may be a job best left to someone else. Data from the Cleveland Clinic shows that shoveling snow sends more than 11,000 people to the hospital each year. For many, shoveling can cause orthopedic injury. For others, it can trigger a heart attack. Don’t hesitate to ask for help. If you must shovel, work in short shifts, don’t overload the shovel and dress in warm layers to protect yourself from the elements.
Hypothermia and frostbite
Frigid temperatures can be more than unbearable—they can be downright dangerous. If you’re going to be outside for an extended period of time, you need to be dressed for the weather—heavy coat, hat, gloves, scarf, warm socks and boots. Without the proper attire, you risk frostbite on exposed skin and an unsafe drop in body temperature, known as hypothermia, which can result in death. Older adults are at a higher risk of hypothermia due to changes that happen as your body ages. Your best bet is to keep the inside temperature of your home at 65 degrees or warmer and limit outside exposure to short trips.
Driving
Have your vehicle serviced and winterized so it’s ready for less-than-optimal driving conditions. Be sure to check the oil, antifreeze, tires, battery and wipers. Assemble an emergency kit to keep in your trunk with a few basic supplies: blankets, jumper cables, windshield scraper, small shovel, rock salt or cat litter (for tire traction if you get stuck), water and non-perishable food, flashlight and first aid kit. If you must drive in winter weather, be especially careful on overpasses, bridges and ramps, which tend to freeze before roads. Consider taking an alternate route to avoid roads that aren’t well-traveled or cleared. Always take your cell phone so you can reach out for help in case of an emergency.
Home Heating
The best place to be on a cold, snowy day is in the warm comfort of your own home. Older adults come from a generation that’s familiar with and often prefers the use of alternate heat sources, such as fireplaces, gas heaters and wood stoves. But these sources can be hazardous if not safely managed. Before you fire up your heating devices for the season, make sure they’re properly maintained, cleaned and vented. If not, you run the risk of exposure to carbon monoxide. Make sure you have smoke and carbon monoxide detectors in your home and frequently test the batteries. If you’re using a space heater, be sure to keep it at least three feet away from anything that can burn (curtains, rugs, bedding, etc.).
FirstLight Home Care – Senior Home Care Services
The best winter safety tips for seniors are to be aware of cold-weather risks and ask for help when needed. Whether it’s assistance with snow removal, a ride to the grocery store or doctor’s appointment, or help arranging a service technician for your car or home heating device, you don’t have to tackle these tasks on your own. FirstLight can help. With awareness, pre-planning and winter safety tips, you can safely maintain independence at home, no matter what challenges Old Man Winter throws your way."
572,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/seniors-adapt-to-the-loss-of-a-partner/,"Coping with the death of a spouse is never easy. This week, I was again reminded of the number of people who deal with the fall out on a daily basis. On Tuesday, The Washington Post ran an eye-opening piece that discussed not only how the loss of a spouse can emotionally and physically impact an older American—but more importantly, it delved into new coping mechanisms brought forth by boomers. How are they changing the ways senior citizens are moving forward after a loss?
Given the statistical data, changes are in order. The Post reports that those senior citizens measuring higher than others on loneliness scales had higher blood pressure, which creates a major risk for heart disease. And it’s no surprise that women are at greater risk for loneliness than men. U.S. Census data indicates that last year, 41 percent of American women older than 65 were widowed, compared with 13 percent of men. Isolation can be acute for those seniors who lose their spouse and live alone.
So what can be done to help this sector of the population in need of outreach? It seems that the boomers may already be on their way to helping themselves by engaging in more tech-savvy tactics to stay connected. Increasing public awareness of the issue has also sparked the expansion of crisis hotlines, and communicating with community and religious organizations to help reduce threats of senior isolation. Primary-care physicians are also taking more proactive measures at identifying depressive symptoms during routine check ups to limit their impact on other areas of a senior’s life.
But the core of staying connected to the world after the loss of the spouse often relies on companionship—whether it’s in the form of in-home visits or taking someone on simple errands, such as to the bank or grocery store. Staying socially connected to the outside world is integral to the mental and physical well-being of an older American, a mission that we at FirstLight Home Care take seriously. It’s true the boomers may be more likely than their parents to seek help when life jeopardizes their well-being—they have, after all, put their wellness first for decades. But remaining a visible resource for those in need will never be passé. Our culture of care is cornerstone of our philosophy as we continue to grow our franchise network. How can we work with you to help uphold our mission?"

Alzheimer’s is a particularly cruel disease, as it wipes away a human’s personality one day at a time until they become unrecognizable to us. And though it happens relatively frequently in seniors, almost to the point of expecting it, it still isn’t any easier to both cope or live with.
How Alzheimer’s Starts Progresses, and Ends
Over 100 years ago, in 1906, the disease now known as Alzheimer’s was first discussed by Alois Alzheimer. And today, a century after it was first described, almost 30 million people worldwide suffer from it, with the number expected to increase to 1 in 85 in only 35 years’ time.
How it works is plaques (beta-amyloid peptide, cellular material) and tangles (bunches of the protein tau) attach themselves to the brain, causing neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex—as well as some subcortical regions—to be destroyed. This damage greatly reduces the brain’s ability to work at peak performance, as it no longer has enough neurons to complete ordinary tasks. Alzheimer’s is usually diagnosed in the 65+ demographic, although early-onset Alzheimer’s also occurs, usually with faster and more devastating effects.
Beginning
The early stages of Alzheimer’s are very easily confused with “normal” aging symptoms like mild confusion, slightly decreased memory, searching for words, and forgetting where things are, or other symptoms related to stress.
But if these symptoms persist, deviate from the norm enough, or start to interfere with daily living and activities, tests may be in order to confirm Alzheimer’s (a fully definitive diagnosis can only be performed post-mortem by examining brain tissue for an abundance of plaques and tangles). This test will usually involve the following, and is used to place the senior into one of seven stages:
- Complete medical history
- Physical tests (e.g. blood tests, brain imaging) to rule out any other possible causes
- Physical and neurological exam
- Mental status tests
How the last test is performed may vary from doctor to doctor, but they’re all checking for signs that the senior’s mental status is significantly deviant of the norm. For example, it’s normal to forget a word in the middle of a sentence, but a key characteristic of Alzheimer’s is using what seems like every other word to describe the word except the word itself, and consistently doing so.
Middle
As Alzheimer’s progresses—there is no cure—the symptoms get worse and worse, and the good days become less and less. The Alzheimer’s Association defines Stage 4, the exact middle of Alzheimer’s progression, as containing symptoms in the following areas:
- Forgetfulness of recent events
- Impaired ability to perform challenging mental arithmetic—for example, counting backward from 100 by 7s
- Greater difficulty performing complex tasks, such as planning dinner for guests, paying bills or managing finances
- Forgetfulness about one’s own personal history
- Becoming moody or withdrawn, especially in socially or mentally challenging situations
End
As seniors with Alzheimer’s reach the end of the disease spectrum, the symptoms are at their worst and cruelest. It becomes quite evident that the senior has had Alzheimer’s for quite some time as they no longer can speak or respond to their environment, have trouble swallowing, suffer from muscular rigidity, and need a great deal of assistance with day-to-day activities.
The care involved in late-stage Alzheimer’s is very specialized and high-level, as seniors need to be physically lifted out of bed, dressed, bathed and fed. Seniors also become very vulnerable to infections, such as pneumonia and bed sores, from their bodies’ muscles not reacting as they should.
Caring for Seniors with Alzheimer’s
Becoming a caregiver can be an incredibly difficult task, but also a rewarding one as you maintain a bond with your senior right up until the very end. In the beginning and middle stages, your role as a caregiver is centered on assisting your senior with mild activities, such as driving them to social activities, helping with grocery shopping and cooking, labeling drawers in the home, and attending doctor’s visits.
But as Alzheimer’s steadily progresses, your role takes on a different slant: to provide and maintain quality of life for them. Because your senior now operates on a very primal, visceral level, it’s important to engage the senses and keep a calm, soothing atmosphere.
Although it may be difficult to constantly be face-to-face with the ravages of Alzheimer’s, some activities you can do as a caregiver include:
- Playing their favorite music, as music is one of the most powerful memory triggers and soul soothers around
- Reading aloud to them so they can hear your voice, even if they can’t respond
- Cooking or baking for them, with smell being another extremely powerful memory trigger
- Performing small physical activities, like brushing their hair, rubbing lotion onto their hands, massaging their feet, legs, hands or arms (gently)
- Going for a walk or sitting outside on a nice day to feel the sun
- Pool immersion, if the pool has a special lifting device designed for physical incapacity
- Going over a photo album together
Along with these activities, another option as a caregiver is to consider hospice care for your senior. What hospice care does is focus entirely on reducing the pain and discomfort of your senior’s symptoms, and increase end-of-life quality as much as possible. To qualify for Medicare benefits for hospice care, a medical professional must officially sign off that your senior has six months or less to live. It may be a difficult decision, but the sooner you have it, the easier it is."
574,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/seniors-and-moving-how-can-you-help/,"In summer, it seems everyone is on the move—both literally and figuratively. For seniors who are faced with the decision to move, the situation may not seem entirely sunny. One of the hardest things we may have to do as a caregiver or child is watch a senior struggle with the prospect of leaving a residence that bears strong emotional and physical ties. Not only are many seniors bound by lifelong memories to their homes, but a physical illness or disability may prevent them from seeking friends or companions outside a new location. As a caregiver or spouse, you can help make the transition smoother if a loved one is faced with moving. At FirstLight Home Care, we specialize in offering companionship services that help seniors faced with the daunting task of relocating. How can you help a loved one or senior in your life? Take note of these helpful tips to ease the transition.
The Right Size
Are you familiar with the term “right-sizing?” Often times, seniors who now live on their own no longer have a need for a large living space. As a caregiver, you can help them through the arduous process of sorting through items and cherished belongs they may not be ready to give up. It’s important to stress patience during the process. Allow them the opportunity to have a say in what stays and what goes—and remember to be aware of a senior’s energy level. Allow plenty of preparation to get everything packed.
Keep Them Involved
When moving into a new space, talk with your senior about a new decorating scheme. Let him or her choose a new sofa or drapery—anything that will replace the larger items left behind at the old space. By keeping loved ones involved in these decisions, you are allowing them control of the situation while still providing pivotal guidance—which is what FirstLight’s “Culture of Care” is all about.
Time It Right
Because moving can be such an emotional ordeal for a senior, arrange to spend time with him or her away from the original residence while the physical move is occurring. This will lessen the mental impact and result in a smoother transition. Consider spending time at the new place and helping unpack. Your senior will likely need assistance and there is no better time to start. As the caregiver, help make the home brighter; drop by a small flower arrangement or even favorite teas or coffees to better settle in your senior.
Moving presents an optimal time to provide companionship services to a senior or loved one. Relocating is hard at any age—for seniors, they should never be made to do it alone. How can you help support FirstLight’s mission to provide the best in care?"
575,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/seniors-and-technology-theres-an-app-for-that/,"Smartphone applications, commonly referred to as “apps”, have quickly become a staple in the daily lives of people around the world. Although often associated with younger
adults, many apps have been introduced to the market that help aging adults connect with technology in a more accessible manner. Whether you need help tracing medications or want to listen to breaking news stories, there’s an app that can be easily used by aging adults. Below is a list of apps that are great to help seniors better integrate themselves with technology and improve their daily lives.
NPR
A great app for news lovers, NPR lets you listen to live broadcasts and read current news.
Interested in accessing older articles? NPR’s app lets you read older articles for free.
Skype
By far one of the most important apps for aging adults, Skype helps people stay connected no matter how far the distance. In seconds, seniors can speak in real time, face-to-face, with their loved ones. The best part is its free!
Find My Phone
Although you need another Apple iOS computer for this app to work, Find My Phone is one of the best apps you can own. This app will not only geo-locate your lost phone, it will also let you put a lock on it remotely so people who find your phone can’t access private information.
MedWatcher
A must have for aging adults, MedWatcher helps people keep track of their prescriptions and gives easy to read descriptions of their medications. The app also comes with
safety alerts to help keep seniors safe and make sure they are using their medical prescription and devices properly.
Words with Friends
Words With friends is a great word-based game that looks a lot like scrabble. People can play with their friends and family, or with a complete stranger, and can play at their own pace. Not only does this game help aging adults stay in touch with their friends and family, but it also acts as a great brain trainer that can keep them mentally sharp.
Facebook Mobile
This app requires an account with Facebook, but it is a great way for seniors to stay in touch with family and friends across the country. Facebook Mobile’s interface makes it easy to post, interact, and view photos without having to be at their computer.
Magnifier and Flashlight
This app magnifies and lights up small text on-the-go that may be otherwise hard to read for seniors. This app is great for seniors who are out of their home and need to read tiny print (like menus at restaurants.)
The Weather Channel
Monitoring the weather is a hobby among many senior citizens, and with The Weather Channel app, checking the weather in their home city and the cities of their loved ones is easier than ever.
New senior apps appear almost daily … we’ll help you stay on top of technology!"
576,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/seniors-can-use-these-travel-pointers/,"It’s almost Labor Day, one of the busiest travel times for Americans. When you think about travel tips for older Americans, navigating through airports and unfamiliar cities comes to mind. But there are so many things seniors can do to prepare for a trip before they leave that will help them stay safe and secure too.
The U.S. Department of State developed a page on its website just for older travelers with lists and things to think about well before starting to pack a bag. Here are some of the highlights we think seniors, and those who care for them, will find helpful:
- With all the security procedures in place and the recent airline delays, take note of the policies for missing flights or having to cancel reservations due to unforeseen events. Flight and hotel insurance is something to think about to give you peace of mind.
- Carry a list of your medications and what they are for. If you need emergency care, having this information handy can be a huge help to medical practitioners who are unfamiliar with you and your needs. This is especially true in foreign countries.
- Check your health insurance coverage before your go. Medicare will not cover you overseas, so the government recommends seniors purchase health coverage for the duration of any overseas trip. If you are traveling in the U.S., check to make sure you can visit emergency rooms or physicians in your destination if needed.
- Call your credit card companies to tell them about your travel plans. This is important due to the fraud protection services banks are offering. If you are going to an area the bank deems out of character, they may put a temporary hold on your account.

577,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/seniors-get-their-kicks-on-summer-wellness-tip/,"I’ve been stirring some social media interest surrounding an article I Tweeted last week on the SilverSneakers® Fitness Program, an innovative exercise and wellness program that promotes fit lifestyles. The Arizona City Independent reports a particularly active program is kicking at the state’s Tri-Valley Fitness Center, where accredited instructors are helping seniors make the most of their golden years.
The award-winning SilverSneakers finds a niche in regions where older populations are choosing to retire. In Arizona, for example, many health plans cover the program, including HealthNet of Arizona, Health Choice and AARP Medicare Supplement, to name a few. And that’s just for starters. States across the country are recognizing the value of continued physical activity as more people enter their senior years.
As a companion service and provider of in-home care, FirstLight has always recognized the importance of maintaining an active lifestyle to ensure longevity. SilverSneakers, for example, offers specially designed classes, as well as health education seminars along with a specially trained Senior AdvisorSM to help introduce participants to the program.
Of course before starting any wellness or exercise program, it’s important to ask the right questions. As a care provider, if you are working with someone who has been inactive for some time, it’s important to seek professional medical advice before engaging in rigorous activities—especially if the older adult is at a high risk for heart disease.
What are some other important questions to raise to the older individual your life looking to get started? Consider a few of these important topics:
Do I need to do vigorous exercise?
You may not need to go all-out after all. It is actually possible to lower your health risks by doing moderate-level activities. If you are caring for someone who wants to attain a high level of cardiovascular fitness, gradually work up to exercising on most days of the week for 30 to 60 minutes at 50 to 80 percent of maximum capacity.
Do women get the same benefits from exercise as men?
Surprisingly, some studies indicate that women may benefit even more than men from being physically fit. Early indications show that physically fit women enjoy even greater reduced rates of death from heart disease than men. That’s great news on the wellness front!
For more great questions and answers, check out the Arizona City Independent piece linked above—as well as some great educational websites provided after the article. And while exercise is always important, it’s also important to keep your loved ones cool during the recent heat waves on the East Coast and beyond. Be smart, safe and well through the summer months!"

August can be a bittersweet month, especially when you are a kid. The summer is coming to an end, the local pool has closed up even before Labor Day weekend hits, and it’s back to school time. But wait…back to school time for many kids is such an exciting time! As Italked to my sister the other day about my nieces heading back to school this week, I vividly remember going to orientation day in grade school with my mom and siblings. This was the day where you ran as fast as you could to view the posted list of who was in which classroom with which teacher, and of course to see if any of your friends were in your class. You received your books and list of needed school supplies. And for us Catholic school kids who had to wear uniforms, we might just get a new one if we had outgrown ours from the previous year.
Then skip ahead about 15 years, and I remember starting my final year of school. I was a senior at Indiana University and taking an introductory computer-programming course. I cannot say that I remember much about the course, the teacher’s name, or that I’ve retained much of what I learned; however, I do remember one of my classmates. She was a sweet little old lady probably in her mid to late 70s. She had so bravely enrolled in a college computer course in order to get herself up-to-speed with computers. I hate to admit that I never actually spoke to her, but I did take notice of an unfortunate situation. You see this wasn’t a beginner’s course in how to use computers. The rest of us in the class already knew how to navigate our way around the keyboard and how to manipulate the mouse. To us, those skills were “simple,” right? Well, to some people and many seniors, computers and this thing called the Internet can be a scary thing. And, rightfully so. I often equate it to trying to ski for the first time at 60+. That could be terrifying! In this case, the teacher politely spoke to her after class one day and explained that he felt she would be better off in a different class…a more introductory one. I obviously still think of this woman however, and her gumption to keep learning later in life. Such a lesson to witness and learn!
Post college, I have come to see that many seniors don’t let the aging process stop them from continuing to learn. It’s inspirational to me, especially on those days when I’m feeling a tad lazy. So, as the days begin to shorten, the leaves are changing colors and beginning to fall off the trees, I encourage you to think about this back to school season as not just about kids. Consider your own back to school plan, enjoy the autumn season and learn like you never have before!"
579,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/seniors-surf-the-web-like-pros/,"Just last week I received an email from my 82 year old grandpa telling me to click on a LINK to his new WEBSITE that promoted a book he wrote. Yes, I am completely impressed that he wrote a book at the age of 82 but I am even more impressed with his use of technology and the internet at the age of 82.
The use of technology and the internet by seniors is ever growing. The use of technology can be frustrating for seniors since technology industries cater more toward a younger crowd and can make it difficult for seniors to keep up with the changes in time. However, knowing how to use technology and surf the internet can do so much for someone 65 and above.
Not only are there physical advantages to the use of the internet like hand/eye coordination and finger dexterity but there is a plethora of information at the tip of your finger that enables seniors, especially those immobile to stay on top of what is going on in the world as well as everyday life maintenance. Grocery shopping can even be done on the internet as well as making doctors appointments, finding important phone numbers, or keeping in touch with loved ones.
Seniors for Living wrote an article on the Top 100 Senior Blogs and Websites. This list is more than impressive and many are extremely interesting as well as informative.
This list gives you the perfect idea of how many seniors are using the internet and technology and that number is only increasing. There are a number of places to visit to learn more about the internet if you are a senior and this is something you are interested in. There are at home tutorials and even most colleges give beginner technology courses for all ages.

Cliques in nursing homes and retirement communities are abundant and according to Gina Kaurich, FirstLight’s executive director of client care services, “there can be a type of caste system among residents and even fun activities aren’t immune from bully behavior.” Here are her tips on ways to combat senior bullies:
- Take care of yourself first and foremost.
- Recognize the behavior for what it is—abuse.
- Let the bullies know that what they are doing is abuse.
- Make certain to tell someone you trust about the situation.
- If possible get a witness and then write down the incidents of bullying, including dates, times and descriptions.
- Ignore the bullies.
- Avoid them.
- Do not reinforce their behavior with positive or negative attention.
- Be assertive and demand the bullying stop.
- Get professional help involved as a resource.
If you think an elderly loved one is being bullied and their health and well-being is being compromised, don’t hesitate to get a professional elder mediator involved or report the issue to the establishment."
581,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/september-is-healthy-aging-month/,"Aging is a process that brings many changes. No matter what your age, it’s never too late to take steps to improve your health. Carolyn Worthington, editor-in-chief of Healthy Aging® Magazine and executive director of Healthy Aging®, is the creator of September is Healthy Aging® Month, an annual health observance designed to focus national attention on the positive aspects of growing older.
Here are some great tips that you can apply to your life during the month of September (and beyond to help you live a healthier life as you grow older).
Be positive in your conversations and your actions every day. When you catch yourself complaining, check yourself right there and change the conversation to something positive.
Start walking. Not only is walking good for your health but to get outdoors and see your neighbors is a great way to increase your level of social activity.
Stop smoking. We know, easier said than done. But it’s time to state the obvious. Smoking is harmful for you. If you want to stay healthy as you age, it’s crucial that you stop smoking as soon as possible. According to the National Institute of Health, smoking harms nearly every organ of the body and leads to lung cancer, lung disease, heart and blood vessel disease, stroke, and cataracts. If you want to look your best as you age, consider this: Smoking causes wrinkles and speeds up the aging of your skin.
You are what you eat. What you eat can influence how healthy you stay as you age. Of course, you should include the gold standards of healthy eating, like low-fat protein and dairy, whole grains, and lots of fresh fruits and vegetables. And you should cut down on unhealthy foods like ones that are processed and high in sugar and fat (darn it, we mean cookies, soda, and chips), which have been linked to serious health problems like heart disease and diabetes. The trick is to find the right balance of energy and nutrients. As you age, your body needs less energy. But it also needs good nutrients.
Make the month of September your time to set up your annual physical and other health screenings. Don’t just set the appointment, make sure you go and then, hopefully, you can stop worrying about ailments for a while.
Join us over on Facebook during the month of September. We’ll be posting additional tips, suggestions, and fun ideas that you can do during the month (and need we say this again…and beyond) to help you enjoy your life as you grow older.

582,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/september-is-world-alzheimers-month/,"World Alzheimer’s Month is an international campaign that happens every September to raise awareness and challenge the stigma that surrounds dementia.
Dementia is a term used to describe different brain disorders, like Alzheimer’s, that affect memory, thinking, behavior and emotion. It is estimated that there are more than 46 million people worldwide living with dementia. The number of people affected is set to rise to more than 131 million by 2050.
This September, and all year long, our FirstLight Home Care locations across the United States support World Alzheimer’s Month by raising awareness of dementia and its impact on families living with the disease:
Basic Facts About Alzheimer’s & Dementia
- Early symptoms of dementia can include memory loss, difficulty performing familiar tasks, problems with language and changes in personality.
- There is currently no cure for dementia, but a range of support is available for people with dementia, as well as their families and caregivers.
- Dementia knows no social, economic or ethnic boundaries.
- Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia. Other causes include vascular disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and frontotemporal dementia.
- Dementia mainly affects older people; however, it is not a normal part of aging.
- A new case of dementia is diagnosed every 3 seconds.
- One in three seniors dies with Alzheimer’s or another dementia.
- Caregivers of people with dementia experience a high level of stress: physical, emotional and economic pressures.
FirstLight Home Care and Dementia
FirstLight’s person-first dementia care services at home help not only the person living with the disease, but the family as well by. Our unique programs focus on the care and wellbeing of the entire family and help address the anxiety, depression, confusion, and isolation that is often associated with the disease.
- We provide specialized and individualized care by compassionate professionals who have completed our rigorous training program to become Certified Dementia Caregivers.

- We help the person living with dementia maintain purpose in their lives while giving you and your family the opportunity to enjoy quality time with them, creating new memories.
- Our services allow your loved one to live at home in a comfortable, familiar environment.
- We assist with activities of daily living, such as light housekeeping, meal preparation, and laundry.

583,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/should-you-consider-a-reverse-mortgage/,"7 questions you need to ask before considering this type of loan.
A reverse mortgage is a loan that enables homeowners – who are generally 62 years of age or older – to use part of their home’s equity to obtain cash proceeds that can be used to pay for property taxes or insurance, home renovations, or medical and daily living expenses that help them age-in-place.
This type of loan does not have to be repaid until the last surviving borrower or remaining eligible non-borrowing spouse passes away or permanently leaves the home, or if the homeowners sell the home or fail to meet the loan obligations.
If a reverse mortgage is something you or your aging parents are considering, like any financial product, there are things to consider carefully before deciding whether to obtain one.
The National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association (NRMLA) has created a Reverse Mortgage Self-Evaluation Checklist to help families better understand what this type of loan is and determine if it’s right for them.
The 7 basic questions you need to ask when considering a reverse mortgage include:
- How do you intend to use your reverse mortgage loan proceeds? From modifying your home to meeting the physical needs of getting older to delaying Social Security payments, there are many reasons why someone would obtain a reverse mortgage.
- Do you fully understand your obligations as a borrower under a reverse mortgage? There are specific obligations the reverse mortgage borrower must meet, including staying current on property taxes, home insurance, and HOA fees.
- If married, will your spouse be a co-borrower of your loan? If your spouse will be a co-borrower, or an eligible or ineligible non-borrowing partner, there are specific requirements and criteria for maintaining and repaying the loan that you will need to know.
- How will your reverse mortgage loan be repaid? A reverse mortgage is a non-recourse loan, which means that the borrower or the borrower’s estate will never be obligated to pay the lender more than the loan balance or the current value of the home, whichever is less. There are different ways the loan can be repaid, and it is important to understand them all.
- Do you receive assistance under any government programs that are based on your current income? A reverse mortgage does not affect regular Social Security or Medicare benefits. However, if you are on Medicaid or receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI), reverse mortgage proceeds may affect your benefits.
- How long do you and your spouse plan to remain in your home? Whether you’re going to live in your home for the next 20 years or just a few years, you need to fully understand the financial impact of your reverse mortgage. Consider this carefully with your HUD-approved reverse mortgage counselor and determine if there are more cost-effective alternative strategies.
- Have you considered other strategies to supplement your retirement income? During reverse mortgage counseling, you may uncover that you might be eligible for grant money or other financial assistance, such as housing assistance, tax deferral programs, home repair grants or loans, food stamps, fuel assistance, social services or healthcare.

584,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/siblings-fight-over-parents-care/,"By Dr. Thomas Hoess
Taking care of an elderly parent from out-of-town is not easy. It’s the late night calls from the group home that your Mom is on the way to the hospital because she may have a blood clot that causes your heart to race. It’s when the phone rings after 10PM that you worry it’s the final call, the one telling you that your Mom passed away.
It is challenging. Harrowing. Stressful.
In my family there’s only my sister and I. Sometimes I think having a bigger family and spreading the caregiving around would be easier. I live in Indiana, my sister lives in Colorado, and my Mom lived in Arizona. She couldn’t live with one of us because her health couldn’t withstand the cold. So we became what is termed as “long distance caregivers.”
Plan Ahead
Did we plan for this predicament? No. My father was extremely healthy and my Mom was always sickly ever since I was young. She was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and lupus when she was 25. As a result, her lungs eroded, her kidneys had problems and she was confined to a wheelchair. However, my Dad was extremely healthy, had a generous pension, and planned on taking care of her until she passed away.
Great plan. Too bad it didn’t work.
My Dad passed away suddenly from a heart attack. He had no long term care for my Mom. She was on Medicaire plus private health insurance, but her medical bills were still exorbitant. When my Dad passed, his pension got cut in half, so my Mom needed to live on $3,000/month. Sounds like a lot, but it’s not. She couldn’t remain in their home, because her daily care needs were too great.
At first we had her in a skilled nursing facility. This was $8,000/month. Then we moved her to a group home plus had a caregiver once a week to take her to her Doctor appointments. Her group home was not plush by any means, and the cost was $3,600/month. Add up her prescriptions plus health care and her daily expenses, and the cost was $6,000/month. That’s more than most people make in a year.
Paying The Bills
I am a Doctor. There is a myth that all doctors make a ton of money. Unfortunately, with the economy making it difficult for people to pay their healthcare bills and the difficulty in getting insurance to pay, I was not rolling in the dough. Plus, I had my own family to support and you tend to spend what you make, no matter what your income level.
So I worked three radiology jobs to help with the extra expenses. My sister could not help financially, so she would take the phone calls, talk to my Mom every day, and fly to Arizona every two months so my Mom felt loved and not abandoned. She enjoyed going there but I didn’t – I found it depressing.
We were lucky I had the opportunity to make the money to support my Mom. I know that a lot of families do not have this ability. Here’s some advice that I learned the hard way:
- If you think your parents have enough money until they pass, chances are they don’t if they need long term care.
- If you can get long term care insurance or nursing home insurance – even for yourself – get it!
- If you are trying to take care of your parent’s long distance, you’ll need a caregiver. Even if your parents are in a nursing home or even if they can drive themselves, it will be difficult for them to do the cooking cleaning, getting to doctor appointments, etc.
- If your parents tell you they are “fine” on their own, don’t believe them. Go see for yourself.
- If your parents still live in their home, get a remote monitoring device in case something happens. It will bring you some security and peace of mind.
I assuaged my guilt for not going to see my Mom by saying I needed to work to pay her bills.
As my sister says: “Writing a check is not the same thing as being there.”
Don’t tell her this, but she’s right. I thought we had a good division of duties: I helped financially and she helped emotionally. However, the burden of taking care of a parent with a chronic illness can be overwhelming, especially when you don’t live in the same town. “It takes a village” as the saying goes. Unless you are an only child (and even then there are friends and extended family), everyone has to pitch in when they can.
Siblings Sharing Caregiving Duties
In certain ways it was a blessing that it was only my sister and I. We didn’t argue about things. Time and money seem to be the two things siblings fight most about. Since my Mom died penniless, there was no inheritance to bicker about. I have heard too many horror stories about siblings who fight over their parent’s care. My wife is from a big family and they are always disagreeing. All of the siblings live nearby, so the responsibility should not fall to one person. However, this isn’t always how it goes. My wife is the only one “who doesn’t work”, so most of the tasks fall to her.
If you’re in this predicament with your brothers and sisters, here are some articles that may help.

I know this. My Mom’s caregiver was a Godsend. Not only did she live close by my Mom, but she truly loved my Mom. They were together eight years, so “Shannon” became a member of our family. She always kept us informed about what the doctors had to say or what was really going on, because my Mom would get easily confused. She had the “local pulse” as I like to say.
Whatever you do, don’t let it turn into a bad episode of Family Feud!"
585,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/signs-elderly-parent-needs-help/,"How do adult children know when their elderly parent needs help?
Oftentimes the parent won’t be the one to admit they need assistance. And sometimes they may even try to hide the fact that they need additional care. We’ve put together some helpful tips on how you – the adult child – can recognize the signs that your aging parent needs help, as well as recommendations on what you can do next. So, while you’re visiting with loved ones this holiday season, keep the following in mind:
Their once tidy home is now being neglected
Does your parent seem to be having difficulty doing typical housekeeping tasks? Are you noticing more dirt and clutter around their home? Cleaning the house can become difficult for aging parents for a variety of reasons. Their eyesight could be failing, and they could be missing spots simply because they cannot see the dirt. They may have difficulty moving around or bending. These physical limitations could be preventing them from doing any cleaning around the house.
Recommendation: Non-medical home care services like Companion Care could offer support to your parent by providing light housekeeping and laundry services.
They are losing track of their medication…or skipping it altogether
As your parent ages, they tend to have more medications to take each day. It may become more difficult for them to remember what to take and when. You may find that your parent has been skipping doses as advised by their doctor, or that they are taking more per dose than stipulated in the prescription. Missing doses completely could affect their health; taking more medication than their doctor has prescribed could have catastrophic outcomes.
Recommendation: A pillbox that stores their daily doses of medicine is a great way to help your parent avoid skipping or taking too much of their prescribed medications. Organize a week’s worth of medication in advance, and place the pill box in a convenient location to help your parent keep up with their medications.
There’s a decline in their personal hygiene care
If you start to notice that your aging parent has unkempt hair, dirty or lengthy nails, poor oral hygiene, body or urine odor, or is wearing the same clothes over and over again, this might be a sign that they need help.
Recommendation: Caregivers can provide Personal Care services that aid and assist with bathing and hygiene needs specific to your parent.
Driving safely has become an issue
Check for dents or scratches on your parent’s vehicle. Additionally, if there is an increase in traffic violations, if your parent easily becomes lost in familiar areas, or you notice signs of deteriorating vision, this could mean that they need to hand over the keys. This can be a hard topic to address with your parent, but there are options.
Recommendation: If your parent is still active and social and enjoys getting out of the house, companion caregivers can safely provide transportation to the grocery store, doctor appointments, lunch out with friends and more.

586,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/signs-it-might-be-time-for-in-home-care/,"Many adult children wonder when it’s time to find in-home care for a loved one. If you find yourself stopping over more often to check on your aging parents or other family members, now may be the time to look at home care options.
Investing your time as a family caregiver is admirable and fulfilling. It’s the circle of life. As your parents cared for and supported you, now you’re returning the love you’ve received over the years. During your visits, you may refill their pantry, look for expired items in the fridge or take out the trash. You also spend time chatting, bringing cheer into their daily life. The time you spend together is valuable and essential.
But it’s still frightening when you don’t feel confident that they are safe at home. You might also begin to feel stress and frustration as you’re spending more time with them and the rest of your life feels out of balance. Sadly, your loved one is probably also feeling the strain as they worry about their inability to live independently.
If you notice that Mom or Dad or another at-risk family member requires more support than you can provide, what do you do?
When to Consider In-Home Care
When your loved one’s needs have extended beyond a little bit of extra support, it’s a good time to consider in-home care. Here are some specific signs to look for:
They Need Help with Personal Hygiene
If you’re noticing a change in your loved one’s dressing or bathing habits, it could be an early sign of a decline in their health, particularly for those with dementia.
When your loved one requires help with bathing, dressing or other personal care needs, it will be more comfortable for both of you to hire a caregiver. A compassionate professional can help with daily personal hygiene in a way that maintains dignity and respect.
They’re Not Safe on Their Own
Potential safety issues are another warning sign it’s time to consider in-home care. Did your loved one leave the house and get lost? Is there a decline in their vision or hearing? Or are there issues with mobility? Other situations, like multiple slips and falls, worsening health conditions, chronic forgetfulness or not eating regularly can also be red flags that professional care is needed.
They’re Missing Doctor’s Appointments
With age, comes more visits to the doctor. If, however, your loved one is missing appointments because it’s not safe for them to drive, then consider an in-home care professional to help with transportation. Preventative care is critical to good health. In fact, 80% of common illnesses are preventable through early intervention and recognizing or addressing a need before it escalates. If a loved one is missing appointments, it could cost them dearly in the form of their health.
They’re Bored and Lonely
Chronic isolation has a negative impact on physical, emotional and mental health. If you struggle to carve out enough time in your day to keep your loved one engaged and in good company, it’s time to consider an in-home caregiver. Companion care can include visiting with your loved one, playing games or cards and having a meal together. A caregiver can ensure your family member is getting the company and conversation they’re craving, contributing to a stronger sense of overall well-being.
You’re Seeing Changes in Their Personality
If a loved one is acting differently or seems “off,” it could be a sign of a more serious underlying condition. Issues like dementia can creep up slowly, impacting an individual’s ability to function.
You might start to notice it in the form of erratic behavior, withdrawing from social conversation or neglect in the home, from garbage piling up to old food sitting in the fridge. These are red flags your loved one is having trouble with basic housekeeping and maintenance. It’s important to get help right away since this kind of environment is unsanitary and unsafe for an aging or disabled individual.
You Can’t Keep Up
There are only so many hours in each day. You have your own family and home to manage, as well as your loved one’s. If it’s becoming increasingly difficult and exhausting to keep up with both, then consider hiring in-home care.
Home care companies provide access to caregivers who will assist with light housekeeping and meal preparation. Caregivers also help by running errands and going grocery shopping, so you don’t have to worry about expiring food in the fridge or transportation for your loved one. You also don’t have to be the one who’s handling all the household chores. You and your loved one can both get help and enjoy a better quality of life.
Most importantly, an in-home caregiver can ensure your loved one remains safe. Whether they require assistance while showering or shaving or help getting around the house, you won’t have to stress about their safety. If your loved one has dementia or Alzheimer’s, you can also request caregivers with experience in these areas. Your loved one will be in capable and compassionate hands, living a more enriching life, happily at home.

587,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/simple-ways-family-caregiver-can-take-time-for-themselves-and-not-feel-guilty/,"As a family caregiver, you are focused on the care of others. And often the one person you forget to take care of is yourself. We all know how important it is for you to stay healthy, fit and rested in order to be at your best.
Caring for another is a rewarding personal experience, especially if it’s one of your own family members. But at the same time, factors like exhaustion, worry, inadequate resources, and continuous care demands can be enormously stressful.
It is important that family caregiver takes time for themselves. Here are a few simple ways to get started.
Get Over the Guilt: Wanting and needing time away from caregiving responsibilities can cause feelings of guilt. As the primary caregiver, you need to recognize your feelings and then forgive yourself. Try to let it go. Unwarranted guilt truly serves no one.
Spread the Love: Focus on the most important things that you need to get done as the family caregiver and then delegate the rest. Caregiving for a family loved one should include other family members, if possible. Schedule others to help with meal planning and preparation, housecleaning, errands and transportation to and from doctor appointments, or ask them to lead the caregiving efforts for an entire day so that you can take time for yourself.
Schedule Time for You: Find a few hours each week so that you schedule something for just you. This is your time to get out with friends, run personal errands or schedule appointments, go to the movies, take a walk outside, get a massage, or just take a nap. Let family and friends know the times you’re allocating for you and have them fill in.
Stay Active and Eat Healthy: You and the loved one in your care need to eat right and get plenty of indoor or outdoor exercise. Plan and prepare healthy meal choices that you can freeze and enjoy throughout the week. (Check out our Easy Meals for Family Caregivers board on Pinterest for recipe inspiration). Find time each day to do some form of exercise – walk around the block, or your local mall, or take an exercise class at the senior center. Whatever it is you do, make it some type of physical activity that you both can do together.
Hire Help: Consider respite care. A professional caregiver can temporarily step in while you step out. At FirstLight Home Care, our extraordinary caregivers embrace each day with values of trust, honesty, respect, integrity, and dedication. They treat your parent, grandparent or other loved one just as you would so that you can rest assured they are safe, comfortable and cared for – whether it’s for a few hours a day, a long weekend or during your vacation.

By: Tina Glenn & Roget Berendes
Our two worst enemies when it comes to our ability to fight the winter blues are a lack of sunshine and our tendency to shut ourselves off from others during the cold winter months. Sunshine is vital for good mental health, and it also provides our bodies with needed Vitamin D. Socialization is vital to staying connected to the outside world.
Here are some simple ways to help fight the winter blues:
Get more sunlight throughout the day
- Do your reading near a sunny window.
- Put a chair on a south-facing porch for coffee time or bird watching.
- During the warmer hours, get out and find a chore to do.
- Walk the dog or find a friend to take a walk with.
- Invest in a sunlamp. Even artificial light can offer great benefits.
Socialize! We are all social beings. Yes, some of us are more social than others, but everyone needs the stimulation provided by socialization. When we drift away from friends and family and the outside universe, we start losing our social safety net. We also tend to start feeling sorry for ourselves with “pity parties” that soon follow.
Don’t allow the cold weather to keep you from socializing. Get creative and find ways to spend time with others, such as:
- Call a friend or invite someone over for coffee or lunch.
- Get involved at your local senior center.
- Volunteer in your local community, such as an animal shelter, the humane society, Habitat for Humanity, or your church. Reaching outside of ourselves and helping others does a world of good for our mood and staying positive.
- Enroll in a class. Many local universities and community colleges have adult enrichment classes.
- Tour local museums or visit area libraries. Both often have activities and enrichment projects that can keep your brain active and provide an opportunity for socialization.
Keep a pet. Taking care of a dog, cat or other pet is also good for our maintaining a healthy mental outlook. Their needs keep us going and are a wonderful source of unconditional love! If you don’t have a pet, consider visiting your local humane society or animal shelter and donate some love!
Reclusion can be a killer. The medical community maintains that those who shut themselves off from the outside world find themselves without a social safety net and are most at risk for depression and other major illnesses, especially during the cold winter months.

589,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/six-mistakes-adult-children-make-when-parents-are-aging-and-sick/,"As an adult child, caring for an aging or sick parent is a major responsibility. While there are many factors and decisions to consider, there are also precautions the adult child must prepare for and seek to avoid while caring for their aging parent.
- Failure to plan ahead. Be sure to take proactive steps for long-term care in
regards to your parent. Research the different living options that are available and what the best option may be for them; in-home care, adult daycare, assisted living, etc. Also, seek background information and survey results from residents or clients. Meet with healthcare or senior care specialist to discuss your specific situation, figure out together what the best option for your parent(s) may be.
- Emotionally unprepared. Failing to prepare yourself emotionally for the changes that come with aging parents can have a permanent effect on you. Give yourself enough time to cope mentally and emotionally, especially if you’re now sharing your house with your parent(s), they’re suffering from an illness, or they’re experiencing memory problems which contribute to moodiness or frustration. The more emotionally and mentally prepared you are, the more patience and understanding
you will have with your aging parent.
- Give them space to fail. Of course you want to protect your parents as they protected you as a child. However, try to remember, that as a child, often times you needed and wanted your own space to try things yourself. The same goes for your parents. Give them the space to figure out their own care needs, as long as
they aren’t facing severe risks. Small needs like keeping up with the house,
cooking, home repairs, etc.
- Failing to understand the overall situation. Not evaluating your parent(s)’
cognitive ability and overall health won’t help you understand their situation any better and will lead to more frustration. Have them evaluated for dementia, early signs of Alzheimer’s or other degenerative cognitive diseases, as well as a full health evaluation to better understand the care options, treatments and medications that need to be changed or taken.
- Failingto let your parents feel a sense of control. Everyone needs and wants to feel in control of their lives, no matter what age they are or how ill they become. It’s natural to want to help your parents without asking them, but instead discuss with them their opinions and wants so they feel they are able to have a say still, and find a way to compromise on issues that you may not see eye-to-eye on. Remember, it’s still their life.
- Neglecting to take proper care of yourself. It’s easy to become so caught up with taking care of your aging or sick parent, that you forget about your own health, which will slowly begin to deteriorate. Remember, to take time for yourself ever so often, find a support group, schedule and maintain regular doctor appointments. If you’re not healthy and taken care of, it will reflect on the care you provide for your parent.
There are several factors, issues and topics to consider while taking care of an aging or sick parent. It may seem overwhelming, however, by preparing in advance and becoming cautious and educated with your parent’s situation, will help to eliminate stress."
590,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/six-reasons-men-go-doctor/,"60 percent of men don’t go to their doctors regularly.
June is Men’s Health Month and for good reason. In a recent study of 500 men by Cleveland Clinic found out that only three in five get an annual physical and just over 40 percent go to the doctor only when they fear they have a serious medical condition. Of those they surveyed, over 53 percent agree that their health just isn’t something they talk about and 19 percent admitted they go to the doctor so their significant other or loved one will stop nagging them.
If you are like the males in this study and have not been to the doctor in the last year, here are 6 reasons why you should go:
- Regular checkups can detect different diseases that could threaten men’s health, including prostate cancer, which affects one in six men. (Source: Mayo Clinic)
- Most people who have high blood pressure don’t know it. Going to your doctor will keep this in check and if you have high blood sugar and cholesterol levels, together with your doctor, you can get this in control before it spirals into something very serious. (Source: American Heart Association)
- Going to the doctors annually allows you to lead by example to other males in your life and to be proactive in your health. (Source: FirstLight Home Care)
- Men are twice as likely as women to suffer from work-related stress. Stress on its own has a huge impact on health, and add to this how men tend to shut off their feelings, and it’s a ticking time bomb. Research shows that almost three quarters of people who kill themselves are men and men are three times more likely than women to become dependent on alcohol. (Source: Everyday Health)
- Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) generally affects more men than women under 50 years old, nearly one in six men compared to one in 10 women will die from coronary heart disease. (Source: American Heart Association)
- No matter how strong or successful you are, sometimes we need help. It is important that when something is not right, you need to admit it and address it.
Even if you think you’re in fantastic health, you really can’t afford to avoid the annual doctor’s visit. If you don’t have a doctor’s appointment set on your calendar, today is the day to make that call.

591,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/sleep-for-family-caregivers/,"We all know how important a good night’s sleep is to our health. Regular sleep deprivation can increase the risk for many health issues, including high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, stroke and dementia.
Quality sleep for family caregivers is critical as they can especially be at risk for sleep problems, including insomnia (the inability to fall or stay asleep), hypersomnia (problems staying awake), and poor-quality sleep. While taking care of a loved one, caregivers often get up in the middle of the night to help, or they stay up late to get their own chores done. Additionally, many family caregivers fall into the sandwich generation as they attempt to provide care to elderly parents and juggle the demands of young families and full-time careers.
It can be a vicious cycle. Lack of sleep can lead to irritability and exhaustion. Depression, anxiety or fatigue from caregiving are common as well. When this happens, it can be extremely difficult to not only keep your own health in check but to properly take care of someone else.
There are several signs of sleep issues to be aware of. Consider seeing a doctor if any of these begin to affect your health:
- Frequent nightmares
- Confusion upon waking
- Regular waking during the night
- Inability to get back to sleep after waking
- Inability to perform daily activities
- Sleep issues that last longer than three weeks
Sleep needs vary across ages and are impacted by lifestyle and health. According to the National Sleep Foundation, you must determine how much sleep you need and how you feel on different amounts of sleep by assessing not only where you fall on the “sleep needs spectrum,” but also by looking at what lifestyle factors are affecting the quality and quantity of your sleep.
Though research cannot identify the exact amount of sleep needed by people at different ages, the National Sleep Foundation has created a chart that includes sleep needs for different age groups, as well as tips for getting better sleep. For example, it is recommended that adults aged 26-64 get 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night. Check out the full chart here.
For a better night’s sleep, remember these healthy tips:
- Keep a regular bedtime routine and try to turn in around the same time each night.
- Use your bed for sleeping only.
- Keep your bedroom quiet, comfortable and at a consistent temperature.
- Turn off electronics – phones, laptops, tablets – before bed.
- Stay active and get regular exercise during the day.
- Avoid tobacco and alcohol and try to avoid caffeine late in the day.
- Try relaxation exercises, meditation or a warm bath before bed.
- Get help with caregiving. Share your caregiving responsibilities with other family members or consider hiring respite care to provide regular breaks.
Proper sleep for family caregivers should be a priority. It’s not only necessary for you to take care of yourself but also for providing quality care for your loved one.
FirstLight Home Care sends professional caregivers into homes to provide compassionate non-medical home care. We help with everyday activities such as bathing and personal hygiene, meal preparation and eating, light housekeeping and laundry. We also offer Respite Care, giving family caregivers a much-needed break from their own caregiving role.

592,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/small-changes-heart-health/,"“Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.”
– American author Robert Collier
Small changes matter. That is true of many things in life, even when it comes to taking action to maintain heart health. Applying small changes at an early age can have positive, lasting effects. And making those changes before developing a chronic condition, such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol, is key.
Why is this so important? Because heart disease is the No. 1 cause of death in the U.S. And most Americans aren’t even aware that they could be at risk for the disease.
The American Heart Association suggests that you can take steps toward better heart health. You could lower your risk of heart disease and improve your quality of life by focusing on seven key health factors and behaviors. The great thing is that anyone can make these changes.
So, if you are concerned about the heart health of a loved one, or if you’re a family caregiver who needs to attend to your own health and well-being, pay attention to these seven improvements that could help you live a long, productive, healthy life.
Manage Your Blood Pressure
High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke. When your blood pressure stays within healthy ranges, you reduce the strain on your heart, arteries and kidneys, which can ensure you stay healthier longer. Get the facts and learn how to manage your blood pressure.
Control Your Cholesterol
High cholesterol can cause plaque, which can clog arteries and lead to heart disease and stroke. Managing your cholesterol helps keep your arteries clear of blockages. If you have high cholesterol, work with your healthcare provider on the best treatment for you, which may start with – you guessed it – making important lifestyle changes like many of the ones listed here.
Reduce Your Blood Sugar
Most of the food we eat is turned into glucose, also known as blood sugar. Our bodies use glucose for energy. Over time, high levels of blood sugar can damage your heart, kidneys, eyes and nerves. You can lower your risk of diabetes by maintaining a healthy weight, eating right and staying active. Find out if you’re at risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke.
Get Active and Stay Active
A little activity can go a long way. Getting some form of physical exercise every day can help increase your length and quality of life. You don’t have to join a gym to get exercise. There are plenty of ways to stay active at home. Walking is a great place to start.
Eat Better
Maintaining a healthy diet is one of the best ways to combat cardiovascular disease. You know the drill – eat more fruits and vegetables and watch the amount of salt and sugar you take in as these can increase your risk of obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes. Don’t forget about how you hydrate. Sugary beverages can be dangerous. Water is always your best choice.
Lose Those Extra Pounds
If you’re carrying extra weight, you could be damaging your heart, lungs, blood vessels and skeleton. Losing weight is a simple equation of calories in vs. calories out. In addition to shedding pounds, eating better and getting regular exercise also helps to lower your blood pressure, give you more energy and help you feel better overall!
Stop Smoking
Smoking is the most preventable cause of premature death in the United States. Cigarette smokers have a higher risk of developing heart disease and stroke, and they have more than twice the risk of having a heart attack as nonsmokers. If you smoke, quitting is the best thing you can do for your health, so plan to kick the habit today.
At FirstLight Home Care, we work with our clients to create individualized care plans that promote well-being and a heart-healthy lifestyle. If you are a family caregiver and need help with your loved one, our professional caregivers can assist with a variety of needs, such as:
- Dressing and hygiene to prepare for doctor appointments
- Support and companionship before, during and after appointments
- Making sure clients follow care plans from their doctor
- Grocery shopping for heart-healthy foods
- Meal preparation according to healthy guidelines
- Encouraging regular exercise and activity

593,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/smartwatches-changing-face-of-the-medical-alert-industry/,"Smartwatches offer unique benefits over traditional medical alert devices
Medical alert devices can be lifesaving for seniors who find themselves in an emergency situation. They also can reduce stress and anxiety for caregivers by providing peace of mind that a loved one will be able to get the help they need after an accident or injury. There are numerous medical alert systems on the market today, the majority of which are traditional in-home units and mobile options for more active seniors. In recent years, some companies have started offering smartwatch-style devices, which offer a fresh alternative for caregivers looking to provide their loved one with extra protection. Smartwatches add enhanced features to the mix that take the benefits of medical alert systems to the next level and may be more appealing for many seniors.
Benefits of Medical Alert Smartwatches
Sleeker Appearance
Smartwatches are generally fairly stylish and look like a “regular” watch. This is a big improvement over traditional medical alert devices, which are sometimes bulky or can make seniors feel self-conscious about wearing them. Smartwatches may be easier to adjust to wearing, especially for seniors who are used to wearing a watch.
This is one of the most important benefits of medical alert smartwatches. As anyone who has experience purchasing a medical alert device for a loved one knows, getting seniors to regularly wear the device can be a challenge. And, the device only works if your loved one actually wears it. Smartwatches make it more likely that your loved one will wear the device regularly and be protected in the event of an emergency.
All-in-One Ease
Traditional medical alert systems typically have two components: a base station and a wearable personal help button. Even some mobile devices have two pieces that users must always have on them. Smartwatches function alone, meaning there are fewer pieces for your loved one to remember to wear each day. Again, this factor can help seniors feel more comfortable wearing the device, which means that they will be better protected.
Helpful Added Features
Medical alert smartwatches come equipped with many additional features that go beyond emergency monitoring services. The additional features can make the devices more appealing for some seniors and help them view the device more positively. In addition to functioning as a watch and emergency alert device, some of the common features of medical alert smartwatches include:
- Activity Tracking: Most smartwatches track data such as users’ activity levels and daily steps taken. Some of them upload this information to a caregiver portal so family members and caregivers can view the information, and even send alerts if something seems abnormal about the users’ activity.
- Weather Forecasts: Some devices may display or dictate local weather forecasts via a speaker.
- GPS: Medical alert smartwatches come equipped with GPS location tracking so monitoring dispatchers can locate users during an emergency. Many of them also make the information available for designated contacts of the user, giving caregivers peace of mind about their loved one’s whereabouts if they cannot reach them or are concerned about them for any reason.
- Messaging and Calls: This is not as widespread as the other features, but some medical alert smartwatches allow users to send text messages or make or accept calls through their watch. This makes medical alert smartwatches very similar to standard smartwatches.
Top Medical Alert Smartwatches
MobileHelp Smart. This device is not a fully functioning smartwatch- users cannot use it to send text messages or make or receive phone calls (other than calls to the monitoring center). However, it does have many other helpful features such as heart rate monitoring, activity tracking and weather reporting. The MobileHelp Smart does have a two-way speaker for easy communication between users and a monitoring center during an emergency.
Freedom Guardian. The Freedom Guardian provides emergency monitoring as well as typical smartwatch services. Some of these features include voice-to-text SMS messaging, activity tracking, customizable alarms for things like medication reminders, and weather forecasting. Caregivers can download an accompanying app that allows them to track their loved one’s activity, giving them peace of mind that their loved one is safe.
Apple Watch. The Apple Watch is not a medical alert device on its own, but apps such as FallCall Lite and Alert provide Apple Watch users with emergency protection. The apps make it easy for users to contact caregivers and loved ones via their smartwatch by simply pressing a button on the watch or its screen, mimicking personal help buttons. This is a great option for those who want all the bells and whistles of an Apple Watch, but who will also benefit from emergency monitoring. However, smartwatch apps typically only connect users to caregivers and other preferred contacts, not an emergency monitoring center.
Smartwatches are making medical alert devices more appealing and practical for seniors and can be a major stress-reliever for caregivers who worry about their loved one’s safety. If your loved one has been resistant to the idea of a medical alert device in the past, smartwatches could provide a new opportunity for them to get the life-saving protection of a medical alert system.

594,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/social-media-for-seniors/,"Let’s face it; social media is taking over the world. Social media networks connect billions of people across the globe whether they’re merely acquaintances that met while traveling, or they’re long lost friends and family. We’re now able to keep in touch and reconnect much easier. This couldn’t ring more true for our elderly population. More and more seniors are mastering the Internet and multiple social platforms, specifically for staying
in touch with their families; checking up on their children and grandchildren, or finding old classmates. Though there are several upon several social media platforms out there, only a select few are used more by the elderly population than any else:
- Facebook: Seniors are learning to navigate the ever-changing world of Facebook in order to keep up with their children and grandchildren’s lives, as well as find old friends and classmates. For the elderly, Facebook is like a constant family and high school reunion every time they log on.
- Pinterest: This online organizational board is mostly used by women in the U.S., ages ranging from eighteen to eighty. It’s another platform that allows you to swap creative ideas with friends and family. Younger men are slowly catching on to it, however, older men seem to be staying away from this platform.
- Skype: What’s possibly better than a phone call to your grandchildren or logging on to Facebook to see their updates? Answer: Skype. Video chatting with friends and family in real-time beats a phone call any day, and the senior population seems to know how to operate such tools rather well.
At FirstLight Home Care, we also offer “Telikin,” to our clients, which is a 20-inch computer screen, (PC), that displays all large font for seniors. Complete with large icons for games, software icons and much more. It’s purposefully designed to help the tech savvy seniors operate their computers much easier.
Social media has spread to the senior population-the number one reason; family. Nowadays, families aren’t living as close to one another; they’re states or even countries a part. Social media makes connecting with family from a distance easier and much manageable. Another reason seniors enjoy social media is for reconnecting. Their best friend from school that they haven’t seen in over 50 years, their old family friends who moved away, or even friends who are overseas, and of course, friends that seniors meet within organizations from senior centers-they’re able to reconnect online, and establish a healthy social life through social media. It’s all about reconnecting and growing friendships for seniors.
Of course, we like to stay connected with our family too. You can find us on Facebook, Google+, Twitter and YouTube."
595,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/solutions-help-loved-one-age-place/,"October 15 – 21 is National Aging in Place Week. This is an annual effort to expand awareness of the Aging in Place movement and the available means for seniors to remain in their homes for as long as they would like.
Here are four things to consider when elderly parents choose to live home alone:
Create a Safe Space
Aging parents living at home need to feel safe. It is important to work with them to remove any potential hazards in the key rooms they live in: the kitchen, bedroom and bathroom. Some basic changes include: Installing bathroom rails; removing all potential slips and falls, such as throw rugs, light cords, and unnecessary furniture; and even lowering pantry shelves for easy access items. Add more lighting, like nightlights in hallways and motion lights around outdoor walkways. More active older adults should also be aware of the fall risks outdoors while navigating the neighborhood. These changes around the home are simple and inexpensive things you can do to provide family caregivers with an added measure of confidence when having a parent live alone.
Deliver the Essentials to their Doorstep
Driving can be a challenging activity for an elderly parent. The inability or desire to drive may put more demand on the caregiver’s already hectic schedule, but there are solutions that can help. Simplify their grocery shopping by ordering online and having it delivered to their doorstep. If your elderly parents want to do certain errands without the aggravations of driving, utilize a local business, like FirstLight Home Care, that can provide companion care solutions like driving them to various errands, doctor appointments and community activities.
Understand their Medical Needs and Limitations
Many elderly parents are required to take medicines or check their blood sugar levels daily. Living at home, when there’s no one there to remind them, can negatively impact their health and their ability to remain at home. It is important for the family to know and understand their loved one’s medical conditions. Stay in contact with the doctor, pharmacist and/or nurse of an elderly loved one. To reduce stress on the caregiver, consider using mobile health tools like “smart” pill bottles that remind patients to take their medicine, or a calendar app to track doctors’ appointments.
Develop an Emergency Plan
Unexpected falls and medical events (such as heart attacks or strokes) occur, and each second that passes matters. It is important that whatever happens with an elderly parent living alone, there is a communication plan with the caregivers. Devices, such as a Personal Emergency Response Systems (PERS), allow users to easily and quickly call for help in an emergency by pushing a button. A PERS will provide caregivers with peace-of-mind should a loved one suffer a mishap. Mobile PERS solutions can create the perfect balance between care and freedom. These systems have GPS capability, which could help locate an elderly parent in the event of an accident, automatic fall detection and two-way phone communication. This new technology will support elderly independence for the healthy aging population and those living with chronic conditions.
Nearly 90 percent of people over age 65 want to stay in their home for as long as possible, and 80 percent believe their current residence is where they will always live.

What can we do to stay out of the doctor’s office each year?
How To Stay Healthy
As flu season is upon us, I decided to consult the experts at WebMD. What are the characteristics of people who get sick less often? What can you do to stay healthy?
- Keep your stress at lower levels so it does not weaken your immune system.
- Enjoy sex on a regular basis because it produces immunoglobulin, a protein that wards off colds.
- Get a pet so you’ll exercise regularly. Pets contribute to lower blood pressure, a healthier heart and less depression.
- Keep in touch with your friends because people with good social networks live longer than those without.
- Smile and keep a good attitude, because this makes your immune system stronger.
- Eat a diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables in a rainbow of colors. Green peppers, oranges and broccoli all contain antioxidants which protect your cells from free radicals that can damage your cells.
- Take a multi-vitamin for immune system health.
- Avoid foods that have empty calories like fast foods and snack foods. Unfortunately, candy and pop don’t have any of the vitamins and nutrients you need.
- Consider taking supplements that are high in garlic, ginseng, milk and probiotics.
- Exercise for at least half an hour a day to not only build your immune system but reduce your risk of osteoporosis and heart disease.
- Get 7 – 9 hours of sleep a night and avoid caffeine and alcohol close to bedtime.
- Stop smoking because it makes you more susceptible to cancer and lung disease. In addition to reducing your immune system.
- Wash your hands with soap and water to wash away the germs other people carry.
Staying healthy is a matter of keeping your immune system strong!"

Long-term stress of any kind, including caregiver stress, can lead to serious health problems. At FirstLight Home Care we understand how stress impacts families. When a family member is ill, aging, disabled, or unable to complete daily tasks on their own, a family member may find themselves becoming the caregiver for their loved one. Caregiving is a 24/7 job and the stress from the demands can take its toll on the family member leading the care. We’ve seen it often and we’ve written many blog posts to help support the caregiver and their families with tools, tips, and resources on how to reduce the level of caregiver stress.
We went through our blog library and found a few of our most popular blog posts related to stress that you might find helpful.
Caregiver Burnout
For many, taking on the role of family caregiver is unfamiliar territory. While caring for a loved one is a worthwhile responsibility, it also can cause a significant amount of stress, exhaustion and sometimes even health issues. Because caregiving is emotionally and physically draining, it can lead to burnout and possible health issues for you – the family caregiver. Learn more about the possible caregiver burnout warning signs and how to keep it all in check.
Challenges Facing Family Caregivers
Caregiving is worthwhile and rewarding, but there are many challenges facing family caregivers. It becomes even more challenging if the caregiver has his or her own obligations, such as a job and children to care for, or if they must travel long distances to care for their elderly relative. Learn more about the most common challenges a family caregiver can encounter.
Respite Care Makes A Difference
Caregiving is often a full-time job that can impact your health and well-being, job performance and overall life balance. It can lead to caregiver stress, anger or resentment, and it sometimes can feel like the relationship you have with a family member is now an obligation. If you’re finding it difficult to care for someone by yourself, don’t let it get this far. Learn more about how respite care can help with caregiver stress.
Over a third of the adult U.S. population is a caregiver for an ill, aging, or disabled relative. The majority are female, and many are employed either part or full-time*. The demands of caregiving and the stress that can accompany these demands can impact your health. There are many great articles related to stress and Stress Awareness month, and there is FirstLight Home Care. Our FirstLight caregivers can help family caregivers reduce the stress associated with caring for a loved one by providing:
- Household help, such as light housekeeping and laundry
- Companionship both during the day and overnight to give the caregiver time to themselves
- Assistance with daily activities, such as bathing, hygiene and meal preparation
- Medication reminders to continue the treatment regimens that are critical to managing physical symptoms of the disease
- Transportation to and from doctor’s appointment, social engagements, and other activities
- Respite care to provide relief to family caregivers who are essential to the ongoing support of those living with the disease

599,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/stress-awareness-month-stress-stops-here/,"April is Stress Awareness Month, a national effort sponsored by The Health Resource Network (HRN) to inform people about the dangers of stress, offer coping strategies and disprove harmful misconceptions about stress that are prevalent in our society.
Prominent writer Martin Boroson, author of One-Moment Meditation: Stillness for People on the Go, published an article yesterday on Huffington Post about “stresscalation”—the way in which we pass our stress to other people, often unwillingly. Boroson challenged readers to vow not to pass their stress on to others for one day, in honor of National Stress Awareness Day on April 16.
It’s no surprise—when you’re stressed, the people around you suffer as well. Your bad day becomes someone else’s bad day which you might not even realize because you’re too stressed to notice. Boroson’s “stop stress vow” encourages people to take responsibility for their stress and find a healthy way to dispel it, rather than passing it on to someone else.
As caregivers, we experience high volumes of stress. Many of us caring for an elderly relative or friend are also juggling full-time careers and caring for own children. Being conscious of this stress and working to find effective coping strategies to manage the stress is important to a caregivers’ wellbeing. This year, the team at FirstLight encourages all of you to “take the vow” and help the world become a little more stress-free."

That’s why I was pleasantly surprised to read a survey released on June 22 by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety that revealed seniors are actually doing a lot of right things when it comes to their driver awareness.
The survey showed that fatal crashes for licensed drivers above the age of 70 declined from 1997 to 2008, along with the number of serious car accidents reported nationally by police. Among the suspected reasons for decrease include some states shortening the renewal period for older drivers and making it necessary for seniors to be tested more frequently.
Additionally, there may be other factors at play. Given our work at FirstLight Home Care, I would like to think that as the aging population grows, more people are taking steps to better manage their physical and mental wellness when it comes to getting behind the wheel. Here are a few simple steps you can follow to better ensure the safety of the senior in your life.
Staying Physically Active: Engaging in a regular exercise program will ensure that seniors maintain strength and flexibility, which will help actions such as turning the steering wheel or looking over a shoulder.
Scheduling Regular Vision and Hearing Tests: These are two of the most important senses the senior driver in your life needs. Make sure all tests are updated before taking to the roads.
Drive in Optimal Conditions: When possible, it’s best for seniors to avoid night driving or driving in inclement weather, such an afternoon thunderstorm.
Plan Ahead: Make sure your senior driver has his or her route planned out before hand. This will ensure fewer distractions during driving time.
Update All Driving Skills: It never hurts for an older driver to take a refresher course, especially if he or she hasn’t driven in a while. This will also ensure that the driver is capable of handling a vehicle.
Above all else, if a senior driver is not capable of driving, make sure there is someone who is able to get them where they need to be. At FirstLight Home Care, the transportation we provide as part of our client service is a priority because we understand the importance of keeping our seniors safe, active and on the move—especially during the summer, when there has never been a better time to be out and about."
601,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/summer-sun-safety-for-seniors/,"In times of extreme heat, it’s especially important to protect our elderly loved ones. At FirstLight Home Care, our mission is to keep seniors safe, healthy and happy in any conditions. If you or an elderly loved one must be in the heat this summer, here are seven sun safety tips to help you stay safe and cool.
1. Put on Proper Clothing: The best summertime clothing for seniors is something loose, lightweight and made of a breathable fabric. Light colors are also best. Long sleeves can protect skin against the sun. And wide-brimmed hats protect your face and neck.
2. Wear Sunscreen: Look for a broad-spectrum sunscreen that protects against both UVA and UVB rays, and one that is sweatproof or waterproof. Remember that sunscreen takes time to work, so don’t wait until you are outside to apply. Ideally, you should put on sunscreen about an hour before you head outdoors and re-apply every two hours.
3. Keep Cool: Even small increases in temperature can affect seniors who are coping with chronic medical conditions. Seniors should stay inside the home in a cool room during the heat of the day. If a senior’s own home isn’t air-conditioned, shopping malls, movie theaters, libraries or a friend’s house provide welcome, cool spaces.
4. Drink Up: The feeling of thirst decreases as we age, so seniors are less likely to feel thirsty. Dehydration can come on quickly and it can be dangerous. The goal should always be to drink between 6 and 8 glasses of water per day and to increase water intake if participating in any kind of physical activity, or if the weather is particularly hot.
5. Wear Your Specs: As we age, our eyes become more sensitive. Wearing sunglasses can help reduce the cumulative damage that causes eye problems, such as cataracts and age-related macular degeneration in seniors. Wrap-around styles that protect from both UVA and UVB rays are best.
6. Avoid Heat Stroke: The sun is most intense during the middle of the day. If you or your senior loved one enjoys outdoor activities, try to do them in the morning. If you are out and about on a hot summer day, it’s extremely important to watch for signs of heat stroke, especially in seniors. Some signs to look for include confusion; disorientation; red, hot and dry skin; headache; lethargy; nausea; and a rapid heartbeat. If you or someone you know experiences these symptoms, seek medical attention immediately.
7. Check Your Meds: A large percentage of seniors take medications daily. These meds might cause an increased sensitivity to the sun. It’s important to review all the medications you’re taking and talk with your doctor about any concerns or questions you have about how the sun and heat might interact with them.

602,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/summer-travel-tips-for-seniors/,"A roundup of some of our most popular travel advice.
According to a recent AARP report summarizing 2019 boomer travel trends, seniors are expected to take four to five leisure trips this year.
Oftentimes, travel can be especially difficult for seniors. For some, there are certain considerations to keep in mind in order to ensure a safe, relaxing vacation, especially if they have mobility issues or are traveling with oxygen. And others may need to do some extra planning before going on a trip, like filling prescriptions in advance and packing all the medications they will need while away. But, with careful preparation, stress-free summer travel is possible.

603,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/summer-travel-tips-for-the-family-caregiver/,"Summer is quickly approaching and for many, the longing for a vacation is in the air. But the idea of taking time off can be daunting for the 40+ million family caregivers who support and aid a loved one with everyday needs.
As a caregiver, a summer holiday getaway may not seem possible, especially if it means leaving your elderly loved one alone in their home. Worrying about their safety while you are away can make it difficult for you to relax and enjoy your well-deserved, and most likely needed, vacation.
Caring for a parent or grandparent can be challenging and respite care is important in order for you to continue to deliver quality care. We want you to enjoy your summer travels, so we have put together four family caregiver tips to help ensure everything goes smoothly – for everyone – while you’re away.
Find Alternative Care
Before you make travel plans, it will be important for you to find a friend or family member who can step in while you’re away. If this is not a viable option, you also can hire a professional caregiver who will stay during the day, night, or both. A local FirstLight caregiver can be there to support your loved one while you enjoy your vacation.
Provide Clear Caregiving Direction
When it comes to the daily activities, medication, appointments, diet and exercise your loved one will need and expect while you’re gone, be very clear with family, friends or the professional caregiver that will be on hand. Gather all the important information and documents – physicians’ numbers, therapy services, preferred hospitals, medications, and other information – for your alternative caregiver, and keep them in one safe place. Creating a detailed plan with a list of emergency contacts, as well as key legal documents (Advance Directive or Power of Attorney) will keep everything in order and reduce your stress.
Deal with Anxiety and Guilt
Feeling anxiety and guilt about leaving the loved one in your care with someone else is going to happen. You need to learn to come to terms with it and then move forward. The family caregiver has the right to take time off, however, it is during this time that anxious feelings may occur. Don’t ignore them. Plan for them. Start with smaller trips, a day or weekend getaway, and then move on to longer trips to be able to cope with guilty feelings and overcome your anxiety.
Recognize the Benefits of Respite Care
Rarely having a break from being the family caregiver is harmful to your health. Prolonged exposure to stressful situations can leave caregivers more vulnerable to developing health issues. It can raise blood pressure, lower the strength of your immune system, and lead to long-term diseases like heart disease or stroke. Taking a few days (or weeks) for yourself will help you be a better caregiver overall. It will allow you to take care of your personal needs, focus on you, and regroup on your own goals like eating right and making sure you’re fitting in regular exercise. A vacation will help you get re-energized.

604,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/summertime-tips-for-seniors/,"Summer is finally starting to heat up, which means our seniors need to be even more mindful of how they handle their health. Each year, thousands of seniors succumb to dehydration, heat stroke and heat exhaustion. How can you help the senior in your life live out their summer season to the fullest? Check out some of my quick tips, as gleaned from a helpful article in California’s Alameda Sun.
If you are providing in-home care for a senior with limited mobility, a loved one or in-home care giver should make sure he or she has a properly functioning cooling system. Make sure the air conditioners are serviced to last through the season. If no air conditioner system is available, the senior should have a network of electric fans throughout the house.
Proper window ventilation is important! Some seniors keep their windows latched for security reasons, but getting air into a home is vital for their summer well being. Install safety latches that will allow air to come in without allowing the windows to be open from the outside.
Be mindful when planning outdoor activities. Seniors should avoid activities that take place during hottest hours of the day, between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. As an in-home care giver or adult child, consider planning a day that may feature low impact exercises, such as light walking or even a game of Bocce ball with friends."
605,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/support-for-the-family-caregiver-the-home-care-lifeline/,"If you’re a family caregiver – a person who provides regular physical, emotional or household support to a loved one who is elderly, disabled, ill or recovering – you’re in good company. According to the National Alliance for Caregiving and AARP, an estimated 43.5 million Americans have provided unpaid care to an adult or child in the past 12 months.
But even with millions of other caregivers sharing their experiences, many family caregivers can feel overwhelmed, anxious and alone. In fact, a recent report from the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine concluded that “…family caregivers need more recognition, information and support to fulfill their responsibilities and maintain their own health, financial security and well-being.”
The services of a trusted non-medical home care provider, like FirstLight Home Care, can help.
Filling the gap
Non-medical home care fills the gap between medically skilled services and the everyday tasks that a person may be able to complete him or herself. From household duties like cooking, cleaning and laundry to individual needs such as bathing and hygiene, mobility support and assistance with eating, non-medical homecare helps people maintain independence and quality of life. And it can be a valuable lifeline for the family caregiver.
Supporting those in need – and those who love them
Home care was designed to provide support to people with a wide range of needs. And to lighten the load for the loved ones who would otherwise be the sole caregivers. Regardless of the level of support needed, family caregivers who take advantage of home care typically have some things in common – they need more resources to sustain their loved one’s independence and freedom, and they want help restoring flexibility and balance to their own lives.
Extending caregiving resources
Home care services can provide you with extensive resources – wherever and whenever you need them. Services can be provided for a short period to help you get through a busy time or on a long-term basis as part of the ongoing care of a loved one. Because caregiving needs don’t stop at night, on the weekends or on holidays, home care services are typically available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
FirstLight can extend your resources with the following services for clients 18 years of age or older:
- Personal Care, which provides assistance with the activities of daily living, such as bathing and hygiene, walking and mobility, continence and toileting care, special diets and meal preparation and more.
- Companion Care, which provides presence and companionship through activities such as regular visits for conversation and company, involvement in recreation, light housekeeping and laundry, errands and transportation, medication reminders and more.
- Respite Care, which allows family caregivers to step out of their everyday routine and take the time to relax, energize and refresh. The service provides family caregivers with a break while professionals ensure their loved ones are cared for – for a couple of hours, an entire day or even overnight.
- Travel Companion Program, which helps make travel manageable and memorable by providing support during a vacation or travel to a special event. The service assists with logistics, transportation, luggage and daily needs like bathing, dressing or meals. Traveling companion services, including FirstLight’s, were featured this week in a story in the New York Times .
- Dementia Care, which provides care plans to help people who are suffering from dementia or Alzheimer’s cope with the anxiety, depression, confusion and isolation that is often associated with the disease. Services are highly personalized and designed not only to help the dementia or Alzheimer’s sufferer, but the entire family unit.

606,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/surviving-the-holidays-tips-for-family-caregivers/,"There is no doubt the holidays can be demanding. For family caregivers, this time of year can be even more difficult due to less time and additional responsibilities. FirstLight Home Care has wrapped up some tips for caregivers to help them make it through the holiday season with more joy and less stress.
Establish ground rules. Communication is key. If regular family visits are part of your holiday traditions, make sure everyone is on the same page. In advance of family arriving, make sure you communicate the physical and mental changes or abilities of the loved one in your care so that there are no surprises. It’s okay to plan for visits throughout the holidays but also plan for plenty of downtime for your loved and for you. You can say “no” to invitations and added responsibilities. Everything in moderation!
Simplify. Ease the holiday chaos and burden by simplifying. Minimize holiday decorations in and around your loved one’s home. Also, be aware that flashing lights can be frightening to some Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and wires and decorative items can become tripping hazards.
Plan ahead of time. We know this is easier said than done. But the more you can do in advance of company arriving, the better it will be for you and the family member in your care.
- Encourage some of your family get-togethers to be potluck meals instead of cooking yourself.
- Stock up on groceries in the event of impromptu visits from friends and family.
- Purchase gift cards at the grocery store for last-minute gift-giving needs.
- Hire a professional caregiver to help you with day-to-day activities around the home or with specific errands so that you have the time and energy to enjoy the holidays.
Maintain routines. Keep your loved one on a regular routine as much as possible. Sticking with their daily habits of eating, sleeping, and medication schedules will help with behavioral and emotional challenges, and it can reduce feelings of anxiety and stress.
Ask for assistance. Talk with family members who may have time off during the holidays or who are in town visiting. Enlist the help of neighbors or other outside resources, even if it is something small.
- Ask family members to help with grocery shopping.
- Have friends and family bring over meals that can be frozen in advance of upcoming gatherings.
- Ask a neighbor to help string up holiday lights.
- Take advantage of local gift-wrapping services.
- Hire a professional caregiver to come in and support you before, during and after the holidays. Companion care services can help with light housekeeping, shopping, errands, and transportation as needed.
Make a list and check it twice. If people ask you for gift ideas, consider gifts for both you and your loved one that will help throughout the holidays and contribute to your caregiving responsibilities:
- Gift certificates to local restaurants or a grocery store
- Homemade meals that can be frozen
- Membership to a food club or weekly food delivery service
- Housecleaning services
- Help for you. Ask them to give some of their time each to help you get a much-deserved day of rest.
Remember self-care. The holidays can be a crazy time of year and it can be easy to let your own needs slip. However, it has been proven that when you take care of yourself, you take better care of others. Watch for these signs of caregiver burnout:
- Loss of motivation.
- Feelings of disconnection with your loved one, other relationships, or work.
- Feeling depressed, irritable or hopeless.
- Lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed.
To prevent this, make time for exercise, eat healthy meals and take time for yourself. Have a friend or paid caregiver come in for an afternoon while you go out and do something you enjoy. Read a book, get a massage, take a long walk or have coffee with a friend.
‘Tis the holiday season! It’s not just about “surviving” this time of the year – it’s also about thriving.

607,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/technology-and-caregiving/,"There is a common misconception that technology and seniors don’t mesh. For a portion of seniors, this may be true, and technology may be intimidating. But for a large and growing number of elderly Americans, technology is becoming a way of life. Computers, smartphones, social media, and other devices are helping more seniors live independently. These new trends in technology not only give family members peace of mind, but they can help family caregivers provide even better care.
GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS)
A GPS tracker can be attached to clothing or be worn on the wrist to tell a caregiver or family member a senior’s exact location. Some can even be set to alert a family caregiver – via phone, text or email – when a loved one goes outside of a certain geographical area. Many GPS trackers now come with an SOS button in the event of an accident or emergency.
Smart home monitoring solutions, like TruSense, use sensor and GPS technology to provide insight into the health and well-being of a loved one. When a potential safety issue arises, TruSense alerts family members through custom notifications. The senior can also be connected to the TruSense emergency response center with a simple voice command via integration with the Amazon Echo Dot. Family members can even ask Alexa how their loved one is doing anytime using their own Echo device.
MEDICATION ASSISTANCE
Pillboxes now include technology. The latest digital pill box can come with an alarm that allows seniors and their caregivers to know what exact pills they need to take and when they need to take them. They can also send out a signal (like a text message or phone call) to let the caregiver know if their loved one forgot to take their medication. These sophisticated boxes are also able to connect to doctors and pharmacies to communicate data on how often patients are taking their medication.
WEARABLE HEALTH
Seniors who are living with chronic health conditions, such as high blood pressure, and need to monitor their vital signs regularly, could benefit from a wearable health device. Historically, monitoring an elderly person’s vitals would require frequent trips to the doctor’s office. Today’s wearable health devices can monitor important vitals while at the convenience of the home, including blood pressure, body temperature and other vital health stats.
Older adults who are working on healthy weight management or who want to work toward a certain physical activity goal to reduce the risk of mobility loss and chronic illness can use a fitness tracker. These devices are worn like a wristwatch and can track a variety of metrics from heart rate to sleep patterns. Some fitness trackers can also track food intake, which can be quite useful for seniors with dietary restrictions or specific nutrition goals.
Wearable health devices provide valuable insights that can help the caregiver understand the health, physical activity, and dietary intake of the senior in their care.
SOCIAL CONNECTION
According to the Pew Research Center, a rapidly growing demographic group for social media use is people age 65 and older. The study showed 34 percent of seniors use social media sites. Some estimates show that by 2020, as many as 50 million seniors will adopt a social media platform, and the reports are estimating this number to grow exponentially in the years to come.
Social media platforms, like Facebook and Instagram, can be used to share experiences and keep in touch with caregivers and family members. It can also help reduce isolation, loneliness and depression. Research has shown that older adults who use social media regularly perform better intellectually and show signs of improved health.
Social communication programs like FaceTime, Google Hangouts or Skype provides a senior the tools to chat by video. Video chats are a great way for the family caregiver to keep visual track of any physical changes to their loved one.

608,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/technology-helps-seniors-stay-connected/,"Staying in touch with family and friends has always been important, but it is even more so as you get older. Chatting with your kids, seeing pictures of your grandchildren and catching up with old friends online helps fend off loneliness and it lifts your spirits. Talking to people used to be limited to phone calls and, for family members who moved far away, occasional trips to visit.
Fortunately, new technology has changed all that, and we want to help you enjoy all the advantages it offers. Here are ways technology helps seniors stay connected to family and friends.
Choose Your Device
No matter where you live, having a computer to help you with everyday tasks makes accomplishing things so much easier. From paying your bills, to reading the news, to shopping at your favorite stores, you can do almost everything online from your computer.
For seniors who like to use a laptop, the choices are nearly endless. Options include large and bright displays to help those with diminished vision, lightweight and easy-to-carry systems, and machines designed for convenient internet browsing.
If you prefer to use a desktop, Dummies explains that you can customize the display of your monitor to as large as you need. Additionally, you can go for a dual monitor setup, add a bigger keyboard and utilize a comfortable, ergonomic mouse. Once you get the system set up, connect your email and social media accounts to check in with everyone, stream movies or exercise videos and host a group meeting on Zoom.
As Snug points out, tablets give you mobility and computing power in a handheld device. You can take and share photos right from the tablet, zoom into the screen with the pinch of your fingers for easier reading and call and text family from downloaded apps.
Whatever option seems right, there are many deals to help stretch your dollars, from top-notch desktop options to tablets and laptops for when you’re on the go. If you opt for a tablet or laptop, be sure to add a protective case. You can find inexpensive styles that shield the device from damage and scratches and keep things such as dust, lint and pet hair from getting into the charging ports.
Phones Aren’t Just for Calls
Chances are good that you already have a pocket-friendly computer: a smartphone. Mobile phones have come a long way, and the newest smartphones have technology that can help keep you connected to everyone. Smartphones are easy to use, respond to touch and voice commands and may even recognize your face.
You can get great deals on popular models for some of the biggest carriers through major retailers, and options are available for either prepaid service or monthly plans. There are also phones designed just for seniors, like the Jitterbug.
Don’t forget to pick up accessories such as PopSockets to help you easily hold the phone when your senior scrolls. Traditional voice calls can be placed on speakerphone if you want to walk around while talking. To see the person on the other end of the line, turn it into a video call.
Senior-friendly apps are available for download in the Google Play Store or in the App Store on Apple devices. Many can be downloaded for free, while some are a one-time purchase price and others are a monthly subscription. Download Skype or WhatsApp for free video calls and chats – as a bonus, both are available in web versions so you can use them on your computer too.
Movie buffs can install Netflix Party to watch movie and TV content with friends and family from afar. It comes with a chat feature in the app so no worries about talking during the movie! If games are more your style, get Words With Friends or Wheel of Fortune so you can challenge anyone in the world!
With all the technology available today, you don’t have to feel disconnected from loved ones. Keeping in contact has never been easier thanks to computers, smartphones and apps.

609,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/test-your-memory-for-alzheimers/,"Are you concerned that you or or a loved one might be showing early signs of Alzheimer’s Disease? Alzheimer’s is a progressive form of presenile dementia that is similar to senile dementia; however, Alzheimer’s generally begins to appear in people’s 40s and 50s. The good news is that with early detection you can have a better chance of managing the disease and living the fullest life possible for years to come.
One of the best ways to determine if you are showing early signs of Alzheimer’s Disease is to do self-basement tests. Self-basement tests are a great way to test your cognitive ability and help you spot the small problem areas that might be arising in you or your loved one’s lives. Remember that these tests are only base level tests and require a doctor to confirm any finding you may have. Below we have listed our top five favorite self-basement tests from around the internet. Simply click on one of the links to take the test and see if you or a loved one is showing early signs of Alzheimer’s Disease.
Dr. Oz Self-Basement Test
Dr. Oz has become a household name in the medical field due to his medical knowledge, respect in the field, and popular TV show. Click the link below to take a self-basement
test he endorses on his website that was created by Department of Veterans Affairs St. Louis University Mental Status.
Hand Drawing Test
Drawing is a great way to test an individuals hand-eye coordination and ability to transfer their thoughts onto paper. Below is a link to a test known as the Alzheimer’s Clock Draw Test. Make sure you have a pen and paper ready to take the test.
SAGE Test
The SAGE test is a 15 minute hand written test that helps detect early signs of Alzheimer’s. This test is one of the best tools to self asses you or your loved one’s current mental state in association with Alzheimer’s.
The TYM (Test Your Memory) Test

610,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/the-benefits-of-dancing-and-aging/,"Dancing is a great social outlet, a fun form of exercise and will help you slow down the aging process. Hello people, let’s boogie.
Dancing and depression: Australian researchers* found that men and women with mood disorders who participated in a two-week tango instruction program felt less depressed and experienced significant reductions in their levels of stress. Dancing is good activity to keep you social and active.
Dancing and Strength: Dance classes, such as Salsa, can increase an older adult’s strength and balance. A study published in the journal Gerontology found that dancing provides a safe and feasible exercise program for older adults.
Dancing and the Heart: The waltz has aerobic health advantages – similar to traditional forms of cardiovascular exercise, such as cycling or walking. The movements in dancing get your heart beating, reduces stress and even helps with relaxation. Dancing is good for the heart based on a study published in the journal Circulation.
Dancing and Dementia: Dancing appears to offer the best chance of helping stave off dementia. As we age, the part of the brain that controls memory, the hippocampus, begins to shrink. This leads to memory loss and sometimes dementia. However, studies are showing that there’s hope in fighting against it and dancing is one form of activity to help fight the fight. According to a 21-year study led by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, aging adults who danced regularly had a 76 percent reduced risk for developing dementia. Experts theorize that dancing is beneficial for our brains because it combines cardiovascular exercise with split-second decision making that taxes our neural network, forcing it to create new pathways.
In spite of the health issues facing the elderly in our communities – Parkinson’s disease, dementia, cancer, arthritis, asthma, and heart disease, dancing is a great therapy for each of these ailments. There are many advantages to adding dance into your weekly regime with very few risks based on the studies noted in this post. Before you start dancing the night away, be sure and check with your doctor, especially for those with pre-existing health conditions.

611,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/the-benefits-of-drinking-water/,"In today’s medicine-centric world there seems to be a pill for everything. Whether you have a headache, digestive problems, or want to lose weight, there is a “magic” pill that can take care of all your problems. But do you ever stop and wonder what might be causing these problems in the first place? Yes, a pill can take care of the pain, but why not take precautions to prevent the pain from ever occurring in the first place? One of the most simple solutions to these problems is also one of the main culprits that cause them: water. According to a report conducted by Boston College, nearly two-thirds of Americans drink a quart less of water than they should each day. By not fulfilling your body’s basic needs for water you will become dehydrated, leading to the minor aches and pains of daily life. These include headaches, muscle fatigue, and digestive problems. For aging adults, these problems are amplified because their bodies require additional fluids to
keep them healthy. Before you reach for the pain killers, you might want to consider increasing your daily water intake instead.
The Benefits of Water
The benefits of water are plentiful. It keeps your joints loose, helps with your digestion process, and can even aid in keeping your memory sharp. For aging adults, these issues are all too common. By staying properly hydrated, aging adults can alleviate minor aches and pains like these that arise throughout the day, and can aid in a longer, healthier life. Imagine your body as a machine. A well-hydrated body is like a well-oiled machine. All the parts and pieces run smoothly and work efficiently, requiring little to no maintenance on a daily basis. On the other side, a dehydrated body is like a dry, rusty machine. All the parts and pieces don’t work as they were designed to leading to complications and impending break downs.
This simple analogy might help you understand the big picture of the importance of keeping hydrated, but what about the specifics? Below are some of benefits that keeping your body hydrated can provide for aging adults:
Maintains proper levels of body fluids
The majority of your body (around 60%) is made up of water, and these bodily fluids play a vital role in your daily health. For example, these fluids help with circulation, digestion, creation of saliva, transportation of nutrients, and maintaining body temperature. So naturally, when your body is dehydrated these bodily fluids cannot perform up to their ideal levels. Remaining hydrated will help your body work as it is supposed which can prevent health problems in the future.
Keeps Joints Loose
Your joints require a lot of lubrication to work properly, and this is true ten-fold for aging adults as the fluids in their joints decrease with age. Fight the pains of achy joints by drinking more water and you will notice how much of a difference hydration makes.
Helps with the digestive process
An individual’s digest tract requires fluids to ensure it runs smoothly. A dehydrated
body will lead to poor circulation of the digestive tract which leads to stomach pains and constipation. Proper hydration can improve the fluidity of the digestive tract and can help rid your need for products like Pepto Bismol.
Keeps your memory sharp
Keeping a sharp memory might be as simple as drinking more water. Although it is not a magic solution to memory loss, proper hydration allows your brain to work more efficiently leading to an increase in neural activity. Drink more water and you will maintain healthier brain function which can lead to a better memory.
Keeps muscles energized
When people exercise their muscles use electrolytes and fluids to work. When the body looses these nutrients, the cells begin to shrivel leading to a feeling of weak, achy muscles and lack of performance. By drinking water, you can hydrate these cells and allow them to work more efficiently, ultimately energizing your muscles.
Helps aid kidney function
The main purpose of kidneys is to filter and reprocess blood to remove unwanted toxins from the body. As a person ages, their kidneys begin to deteriorate and require additional fluids to work properly. By drinking more water, an aging adult will see an increase in kidney function which can lead to a greater feeling of well-being and health on a daily basis.
Tips for Drinking More Water
Ensuring you are properly hydrated is no secret, so why do we forget to drink the necessary amount of water our bodies need each day? The answer is simple, we just don’t think about it. When it comes to eating the reminders are simple, when you are feeling hungry, you eat. However, when your body is dehydrated, you often won’t know until it’s too late and you are parched. In order to remember to drink enough water each day, follow these simple tips:
Carry a bottle of water everywhere you go
You will be amazed at how much more water you will drink (and how little you did before) when you carry around your own bottle of water. The visual reminder of the water bottle will entice you to drink more and works much better than trying to remember to fill a glass on your own.
Drink before, after, and during exercise
Even the simplest of aerobic activities require you to be properly hydrated; the problem
is that we often don’t drink water until we are done and thirsty. This is your body telling you that you’re dehydrated. Instead, drink a glass of water before you do any aerobic activities, and make sure you have a water bottle on hand during the activity as well.
Have a pitcher of water in the fridge that is easy to access
By setting aside an amount of water that you want to drink each day, you can set a goal that you can visually measure. Rather than try to remember how many glasses
of water you drink each day, you will be able to tell wether or not you have finished your pitcher or not.
Have a glass of water with every meal
People often don’t drink water with their meals. Rater than reach for a soda each meal, try
drinking a glass of water. This will help remind you to drink more water since you will be eating at least three meals a day. Furthermore, water with your meal will help during the digestive process."
612,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/the-benefits-of-humor-as-we-age/,"For many people getting older isn’t funny, but keeping your sense of humor as we age has proven to help us cope with the changes, challenges and unexpected obstacles of aging. A dose of humor promotes good health, and has a beneficial effect on some of the most common health challenges of aging. These benefits fall in four important areas, including:
Humor reduces stress: It is believed that laughter works by relieving stress, which is implicated in so many negative impacts on our health. Laughing can help relax muscles, lowers blood pressure and increase the oxygen level in your blood. When you laugh, you are stimulating the immune system, counteracting the negative effects of stress.
Humor makes you feel good: Having a sense of humor can have a positive impact on the perception of pain. It benefits the immune system, and has proven to benefit heart health. Laughter helps keep our blood vessels healthy, reduces the serum cortisol levels in the blood, increases the T-lymphocytes (T-cells) in the body, and improves cholesterol levels.
Humor has clinical benefits: Studies over the last five years have produced findings that suggest humor can have clinical benefits and positive rehabilitative implications. Older adults may have age-associated memory deficiencies, that when humor is applied to various therapies, the results have shown improved learning ability, short-term memory, and delayed recall which in turn has improved their quality of life.
Humor is good for the brain: Humor is a great way to give our brains a good workout. A good laugh can be a highly developed mental exercise that trains us to approach aging and the ideas of aging in different, inventive ways. Researchers say that even the lowly pun requires the brain to shift perspective.
Need a laugh? Check out FirstLight Home Care’s Pinterest board, Ageless Humor, and get ready to cast away any negative attitudes you have towards aging."
613,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/the-benefits-of-yoga-on-aging/,"It is said that Yoga slows the aging process. Here are 4 reasons why you should consider practicing yoga now and continue to do so as you age.
Balance. The component of many yoga poses is balance. The ability to balance involves both your body and brain. By incorporating yoga into your weekly workout schedule you will improve your balance and reduce your chance of falling. 1 out of every 2 women and 1 out of every 4 men over 50 will suffer a fracture related to a fall. The balance poses practice in yoga will improve the communication between the right and left hemispheres of the brain, improving our agility.
Flexibility. Yoga creates flexibility. It will help reduce aches, pains and stiffness that comes with age. Yoga will increase spinal flexibility that if left unchecked, spines will shorten and round.
Strength. Yoga builds strength slowly and safely. Strong muscles increase increases bone density. Weight bearing poses like Downward Dog, Cobra and Plank, dramatically reduce the chance of fractures as you age.
Breathing. Yoga increases our lung’s capacity to bring in life force or Qi, as we turn our attention into our breath. Improving our ability to take in more air increases energy to all of our cells and helps us “get up and go” as we age. Proper breathing also improves digestion. Another distinct advantage of proper breathing is lower blood pressure.
Are you now motivated to add Yoga to your fitness regime now that you see the benefits? We hope so. Start today by finding a Yoga facility near you. Many will offer a couple of free sessions so that you can test out the location and the instructors.

614,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/the-best-christmas-gift-for-seniors-is-you/,"As we all get caught up in the throes of holiday shopping, it’s important to remember the gifts that are the most meaningful. You probably don’t remember what you got for Hanukah or Christmas last year, because they were just “things”. It may have been the latest high tech gadget or even some bling or a bauble. Chances are by this time it’s out-of-date or in the Goodwill bag you have been meaning to donate.
Buying gifts for seniors can be challenging, since they usually have everything they need, and the last thing they want is more clutter. So here are some great ideas that will mean more to them than anything money can buy– and at it will cost you is your time and a little sweat equity!
- Home videos. Last year we put together a collection for my parents of videos from when we were kids to present date and put them all on a CD. Not only did we have a lot of laughs (the changing fashions and hairdos) but they played it over and over again for their friends. And the initial videos didn’t even have sound (my kids don’t remember those way back times).
- Cooking. Think about making an assortment of cookies and fudge and put them in holiday tins. Your parents can give them as gifts to friends or family or for people who stop by over the holidays. Or freeze numerous dinners for them so all they have to do is re-heat them. It beats TV dinners or cereal!
- Home repairs. Because most seniors can’t see as well as they used to, their house may need some home repairs. Consider a fresh paint job, changing the batteries in their smoke alarm, washing their windows and replacing all the light bulbs. Last year I put lipstick on and kissed the window by their breakfast nook. I told my Mom to remember every morning while she was having her first cup of coffee how much I loved her! Not handy around the house? Hire them a handyman! Or have a professional cleaning crew come in and give them a much needed housecleaning break.
- Car. When was the last time your parents washed their car or had their oil changed and their car serviced? Are their tires in good shape? Is their gas tank full? Fill er up!
- Holiday decorations. Putting up holiday decorations is a chore, even if you’re young. Put lights on the exterior of the house, or bring in a fresh Xmas tree with all the trimmings.
- Reading. Many parents have a hard time seeing to read the fine print in books. Consider getting them some books on tape and sit down with them and listen to them.
- Act as a chauffeur. Drive them around the neighborhood to see the fancy displays of lights. Most local newspapers have a list of the neighborhood houses with the best decorations.
- Send out holiday cards. My dad loves to receive holidays cards, but his hands hurt too much to address and write them. Do it for him and hang the cards he receives all over his door.
The main thing is to have fun and use your imagination. Remember that getting older and having all the kids gone can be heaven, but it can be lonely and isolating as well. The best give is YOU!"
615,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/the-biggest-challenges-facing-family-caregivers/,"Family caregiver skills cover a wide range of responsibilities that require endless amounts of energy, empathy, and patience. Most family caregivers will tell you that the time they spend caring for a loved one is one of the most fulfilling experiences they have had in their adult life, but it also comes with its own unique challenges.
At FirstLight Home Care, we know that each home care situation is unique. But over the last 10 years we have seen that many of the biggest challenges that caregivers face are very similar:
Emotional and physical stress: Studies have confirmed that family caregivers have higher levels of stress, anxiety, depression and other mental health challenges compared to those who don’t do companion care.
A loss of self-identity: Caregivers feel like they have less control over their own lives. And that makes a lot of sense because the more time they spend on companion care, the less time they have for themselves, their friends and other loved ones. They often lose a sense of who they are outside of their caregiver job.
Lack of time to care for themselves. Self-care suffers because they lack the time and energy to do things like preparing proper, nutritious meals for themselves. They have limited time to exercise. And they’re often too mentally and physically exhausted to socialize or spend time doing the things they enjoy.
Financial strain. Helping a loved one can significantly impact a caregiver’s finances. Family caregivers tend to miss work, leave early or quit their jobs altogether. This is especially true among women, who compose more than 60 percent of all family caregivers, according to AARP research. Female caregivers are more likely than men to alter their work lives to take on unpaid caregiving responsibilities.
Feelings of isolation. Someone doing companion care may be lonely caused by a withdrawal from previous habits and lifestyle. They often feel isolated and alone in their caregiver job and, without support from others, they believe no one really understands their situation.
Sleep deprivation. Lack of sleep can be a big issue. Family caregivers can be sleep deprived for several reasons, including overall worry or concern for their loved one, staying up late to get their own tasks finished, or managing their loved one’s erratic sleep-wake cycle. Sleep deprivation can take a huge toll on a caregiver who is already experiencing the stress of burning the candle at both ends.
The need to do it all themselves. Many caregivers are ashamed or even afraid to ask for help from others. They want to assume the full caregiver burden and think that asking for assistance may be a sign of weakness. They want others to think they’ve got all the caregiver skills needed and that everything is under control.
Being aware of common challenges that family caregivers face can help you be on the lookout for signs you are experiencing them as well. If you are feeling stressed, overwhelmed, isolated, or exhausted, take action to get help. Ask family and friends to step in and lend a hand. If they’re not able to, we are.
FirstLight Home Care services provide companion care, personal care, respite care, and other localized home care services to help you and your loved one get the care you both deserve. Find a local FirstLight caregiver near you.
In November, we celebrate National Home Care and Family Caregivers Month, observances that are near and dear to us. As always, but especially throughout the month of November, our FirstLight weekly blog will focus on being the CHAMPION of the family caregiver, providing the tools, tips, resources, and peace of mind that so many caregivers need. If you are or have been a family caregiver, we invite you to comment and share your rewarding experiences caring for a loved one, as well as the struggles you have faced throughout your caregiving journey."
616,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/the-case-for-hiring-a-caregiver/,"A USA Today poll revealed that 41 percent of baby boomers with living parents are providing some kind of care to them, either financially, personally or both and an estimated 34 million unpaid caregivers in America provide an average of 21 hours a week of care.
When you realize that an older adult in your family needs extra help, a few options come to mind: move him or her to an assisted living facility, hire a caregiver or move in to do the caregiving yourself. This is a challenging decision for many people and requires some serious thought. Before you jump to a conclusion, consider these points:
Finances. By taking on caregiving responsibilities full time, you limit the amount of time you can spend working and making money. Many adult child caregivers have to leave their job to properly take care of their loved one. Without a job, you not only lose income but also lose input to social security and a personal retirement fund. According to a study by Community, Work and Family, every hour per week that an adult child spends taking care of an aging parent brings them 3 percent closer to losing income.
Time. Caregiving is a big responsibility. Your loved one may need trips to the doctor, medications, help with paying bills, cooking and cleaning help, etc. This may mean less time with your own family and friends and less flexibility for days off or vacation time.
Personal Health. The longer a family member spends as a caregiver, the more likely she is to put her own health at risk.
Career. Most family caregivers maintain their role for at least four years, according to a study by National Alliance Caregiving. If you plan to go back to work after your time as a caregiver, will you still have the skills and contacts you need for your career?
Logistics. If you plan to take care of your parent or loved one, consider your living and transportation needs. Will you stay in your home or move in with your parent? Will you need a car that is more accessible to him or her?
Emotional toll. Becoming your parent’s caregiver means you will essentially become your parent’s “parent.” This changing role can be stressful as you take on responsibilities your parent used to perform for you.
Plan ahead. If you are considering being the primary caregiver for a loved one, weigh these options and see if you can manage your time, money and health well enough to do so. If the answer is no, and your loved one wishes to stay at home rather than move into an assisted living facility, then it might be time to hire a caregiver."
617,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/the-difference-between-home-care-and-home-health-care/,"Home care or home health care? This is a question we get asked frequently.
There are quite a few differences between home care and home health care. Here we explain some of those difference so that you may determine what might be best for your loved one. And remember, oftentimes a combination of home care and home health services might be necessary and can go a long way to help improve one’s quality of life.
Home care keeps individuals safe and comfortable in the place they call home.
When an adult needs assistance with the activities of daily living, or they simply need an extra helping hand around the house, home care can help. An in-home caregiver can provide a variety of non-medical companion care or personal care services to seniors who are aging in place, those living with dementia adults with disabilities and those recovering from illness.
A home care provider supports individuals who need care and assistance performing daily activities such as bathing and hygiene, transportation, light housekeeping and laundry, meal preparation, medication reminders, and more.
Caregivers help with the day-to-day care of elderly individuals who need additional support to keep their independence, but they also provide care for the everyday needs of adults living with a disability or those recovering or rehabilitating following an illness, injury, or surgery.
Home care does not require a prescription from a doctor. The services can be provided by a family member or a professional caregiver, from a few hours a day up to 24 hours a day.
Hiring a professional caregiver can offer peace of mind to family members, especially those who work full- or part-time jobs while raising their own families, as well as those providing long-distance care.
Home care is often paid for out of pocket (private pay) but can also be covered through long-term care insurance and, in some cases, veteran benefits. And now non-skilled in-home care services will be allowed as a supplemental benefit for Medicare Advantage (MA) plans in 2019.
Home health care provides skilled medical care inside the home.
Home health care may be required when clinical healthcare services are needed as part of a doctor’s treatment plan. With home health care, an individual may need therapy, wound care or monitoring of vitals. This type of care is often provided after a person has had an inpatient stay or outpatient surgery.
Home health care services are skilled services prescribed by a doctor. Providers can administer intravenous medications, treat wounds, help manage diabetes through glucose monitoring and insulin administration, provide occupational and physical therapy, and more.
These services are often temporary until the patient can get back to normal function and typical daily activities once they have recovered.
Home health may be covered by Medicaid, Medicare or private health insurance.

618,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/the-doctor-is-in-in-a-month/,"Today we bring you another guest post from eldercare expert Joni Aldrich. This month, she offers suggestions for the post-diagnosis medical waiting.
If you’ve recently been diagnosed with an illness, waiting for that next phone call from your doctor or specialist can be agonizing. Here are some ideas to help you prepare for what lies ahead (and that will help that month fly by!).
The days and weeks following the diagnosis of a serious illness can be torturous. After the initial shock wears off, most patients and their caregivers are anxious for the next step so that they can begin to gear up for the fight that lies ahead. Most families find out that the medical community doesn’t typically work on a schedule that is as hurried as we might like.
In 2004, we received the news that my husband Gordon had a tumor in his spinal column. Our lives had changed forever, and we wanted information fast. To add to the pressure, Gordon was in extreme pain. After hours of bargaining and begging, we were told that our earliest chance for an appointment was still four weeks out. The thought of having to wait that long was unreal. We ended up taking him to the emergency room, he was treated with pain meds and released, but a neurosurgeon did the operation on Wednesday of the very next week. This doesn’t work in all cases, but sometimes it pays to be persistent.
Do everything that you can to expedite your consultation with a good specialist—no matter how many strings you have to pull or people you have to bother—then find ways to stay productively occupied in the days or weeks of waiting.
Research the basics. Fear of the unknown can be overwhelming. If you haven’t requested copies of all medical tests already (in the printed version, too), now is the time to do so. This is the key to doing your own research before meeting with your medical specialist. The Internet can help you translate the big words that we laymen may not understand on the report. Create a long list of questions for your doctor to cover at your appointment. But don’t get too caught up in “Dr. Google.” There’s a balance—you may find out more than you need or want to know.
Review the credentials of the medical facility (and potential second opinion facilities). Once you have a better understanding of the medical test results, you can then begin to search online for the best medical facilities for your particular diagnosis. The simple truth is that it may not be the one you’ve been referred to; that may be only a starting point. “Location, location, location” isn’t just the credo for business and house hunting. Just because one hospital is renowned for treating heart disease, you can’t assume that it’s rated well for neurosurgery. Read up on the annual caseloads, and ask for recommendations from patients who have already received treatment at those facilities.
Call on your A-team. Even though the wheels may seem to turn slowly before the first appointment, once you meet with the physician things can heat up quickly. Are you going to need some help with childcare or eldercare? What about your pets? Can someone pick up your mail? These details can be a major stress relief later. Friends and family will want to know how to help, and these tasks are the perfect response for you to give them when asked.
Keep up with your homework. Spend some time compiling lists of medical information, such as an up-to-date list of current medications, insurance provider information, or a detailed write-up of symptoms and any previous treatment. No one likes thinking about documents like their will, living will, or healthcare power of attorney, especially when the shock of a diagnosis is still fresh. Think of it as something that you need to do for your family. It’s one of the things you can control and do proactively during this time.
Actual housekeeping isn’t a bad idea either. Having a clean home is essential when you are caring for a sick patient, and not having to come home to a pile of laundry after a hospital stay will give you peace of mind as well. Don’t forget the yardwork.
Give yourself insurance reassurance. It’s no secret that medical treatments can be financially devastating if you don’t have cooperation from your insurance company. And receiving upsetting financial news at the peak of an illness or mid-treatment can cause unnecessary stress on both the patient and the caregiver. Take some time to get on the phone with your insurance provider before you begin any treatments or medical visits. Ask questions, get a detailed listing of benefits, fill out any necessary paperwork, and figure out what your up-front costs may be.
Be prepared for an emergency. Even though your scheduled appointment may still be a few days (or even weeks) away, it’s possible that you may find yourself in a situation where the patient’s condition worsens quickly. In these types of situations, you need to be prepared to take immediate action. It’s a tough decision, because you may be in an emergency room for hours on end, and hospitals contain a high volume of germs that you don’t want the patient unnecessarily exposed to. However, there are times when it will be unavoidable, and you should be prepared to take all of the medical test results, medications, and information that you have already accumulated with you."
619,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/the-effects-of-dementia-on-family-caregivers/,"In 2017, the Alzheimer’s Association completed an extensive survey on the effects of Alzheimer’s on the family caregiver. Years since, their continued studies of Alzheimer’s and dementia have found that the effects of these diseases on the family caregiver are more paramount than ever.
In fact, their ongoing research of Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia continues to prove an unsustainable physical, financial and emotional stress on caregivers.
Dementia affects the caregiver and their family. Caring for a loved one with progressive memory loss can impact normal family life in a variety of challenging ways. Caregivers report a greater number of physical and emotional health problems and worse overall wellness compared with non-caregivers. Levels of psychological distress are significantly higher in dementia caregivers than in other types of caregiving. And, caregivers tend to sacrifice their own leisure pursuits and hobbies, reduce time with friends and family and give up or reduce employment in order to devote time to their loved one.
Dementia affects the family finances. The Alzheimer’s Association 2017 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures report indicates that people age 65 and older with Alzheimer’s or dementia survive an average of 4 to 10 years after diagnosis, with some living as long as 20 years. Families typically step in as the caregiver, especially early in the diagnosis. This can impact the family caregiver, especially if the care was unplanned. In many cases, the family member helps pay for the out-of-pocket costs associated with dementia care, which means they often cut back on their own spending to do so. And some also reduce their work hours or even quit their paying jobs to become a full-time family caregiver.
Personality changes can take a toll. Personality changes in a loved one with dementia are often the most difficult part of the disease for family caregivers to manage. Sometimes a person affected by dementia may become aggressive because they don’t know how else to express themselves. Others may experience anxiety, agitation or irritability. Confusion also appears when trying to complete the daily tasks most of us take for granted. Unfortunately, these personality changes can also take a toll on the family caregiver and, in some cases, negatively impact their health.
Many family caregivers who care for loved ones living with Alzheimers and dementia handle the care on their own. But hiring a caregiver to assist with the day-to-day can offer much-needed respite and peace of mind to the family caregiver and help the person affected by the disease to live the rest of their lives with purpose.
If you are a dementia caregiver, don’t go it alone. FirstLight Home Care and our Dementia and Alzheimer’s Care services can help you and your loved one with individualized dementia care plans for daily care. Contact FirstLight Home Care today.

620,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/the-facts-about-parkinsons-disease/,"April is National Parkinson’s Awareness Month to help bring awareness to a disease that one million people currently suffer from with 50 – 60,000 new cases being diagnosed each year. Although there is no cure, there are many medications and therapies that can help to relieve the symptoms.
Armed with information, you can help your family members live with this chronic and progressive disease.
What is Parkinson’s?
Parkinson’s is a neurological or brain disorder that affects the nerve cells in the portion of the midbrain that controls body movements. Although initially there may be no symptoms, there may be a gradual weakening of the limbs and trembling hands. Parkinson’s strikes people between the ages of 50 – 60, and can progress at different speeds with different people. Although the disease can strike both men and women, it is 50% more prevalent in men.
- Tremors or trembling in the hand, face, arm, legs, jaw or head
- Limb stiffness
- Slowness of movement
- Lack of balance and coordination
Symptoms usually begin gradually and get worse over time, impairing a person’s ability to walk, talk or move around freely over time. Other issues may include sleeping problems, depression, fatigue, and problems with memory.
How is Parkinson’s diagnosed?
Parkinson’s can be hard to diagnose, because there is no single medical test and many of the symptoms mimic other illnesses (Alzheimer’s. Wilson’s disease, Huntington’s disease). In fact, statistics indicate that more than 40% of people are undiagnosed and 25% are misdiagnosed. Unlike many other diseases, there are no blood or lab tests to diagnose the disease. Generally, it is confirmed when other conditions are ruled out. Doctors will use a combination of CT scans, MRIs, physical exams, family history and observation over time to try and pinpoint the diagnosis.
What are the causes of Parkinson’s?
In most cases of Parkinson’s, the cause is unknown. However, there are certain factors that can increase its likelihood.
- Genetic predisposition
- Environmental toxins (pesticides, carbon monoxide and metal manganese)
- Stroke
- Bad reaction to prescription drugs
- Brain tumor
- Thyroid disorders
- Head trauma
- Drug use
How can Parkinson’s be treated?
Drugs are the most traditional treatment for Parkinson’s. Levodopa combined with carbidopais is the main treatment for Parkinson’s disease although it may not help all symptoms. Anticholinergics may help with tremors and rigidity. Other drugs, such as bromocriptine, pramipexole, and ropinirole, mimic the role of dopamine in the brain, causing the neurons to react as they would to dopamine. Other people benefit from deep brain stimulation (DBS)
If you or a loved one has Parkinson’s disease making it difficult to perform daily tasks or run errands, the caregivers at FirstLight Home Care can help. We can help you stay comfortably in your home, remaining secure but independent.

621,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/the-financial-impact-of-family-caregiving/,"Being the family caregiver for your aging parent can take a toll on your finances and your personal life.
At some point in our lives, we will either need a caregiver or we will become one. Many adult children automatically become the family caregiver as parents age and need assistance around the house or with everyday tasks. When it comes to providing some sort of assistance to aging parents, many adult children are thrust into the situation unexpectedly. When this happens, it can have serious economic implications for an individual.
A recent survey from AARP indicates that 38 percent of family caregivers – those who take care of a family member, such as an aging parent, for free – report spending more than 25 hours a week providing this unpaid work.
According to the Home Care Association of America, 60 percent of family caregivers report making work accommodations – such as taking a leave of absence, arriving late, passing up a promotion or retiring early. The stress and distractions of caregiving can reduce productivity at work and put a strain on one’s mental and physical health, which also comes at a cost to employers.
The Cost of Caregiving
Caregiving can have an enormous financial impact on the lives of people who find themselves in this role. They often spend their own money as part of their caregiving contribution. A 2017 AARP study found that family caregivers spend an average of $7,954 on out-of-pocket costs related to caregiving, nearly 20 percent of their annual income.
Here are some potential caregiving expenses you could incur or should at least consider as a family caregiver:
- Travel expenses, especially if your parent lives in another state.
- Meals for you and the person you are caring for.
- The cost of gas while driving to and from medical appointments and errands.
- Medical expenses above what health insurance, Medicaid or supplemental health insurance will pay, including prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, incontinence supplies, etc.
- Housecleaning or home maintenance services.
- Personal care or respite care.
- Medical assistance devices such as wheelchairs, walkers, mobility aids, etc.
- Home modifications such as ramps and handlebars or handicap accommodations.
To cover these extra expenses, you, or your family caregiver, may have to:
- Pare back your own spending
- Cut back on saving for retirement
- Reduce and/or stop working altogether to care for your aging parent
- Dip into personal or retirement savings
- Be more cautious in leisure spending, such as eating out and taking vacations
Family caregiving does, however, provide some cost savings to the care recipient. People who have the help of a family caregiver tend to have shorter hospital stays; those who don’t have a higher chance of hospital admission and readmission.
We understand the financial and physical demands that come with family caregiving. At FirstLight we provide senior care services that are affordable. Whether it’s a couple hours a week or overnight care, we can recommend the best in-home, senior and respite care to fit your family needs.

622,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/the-flu-vaccination-for-older-adults/,"Some people go to great lengths to keep themselves and their loved ones healthy this time of the year. Even so, there’s one thing we can count on each time the calendar turns to fall: Flu season.
If you’re caring for an aging loved one, you’ve probably wondered if a flu vaccine should be part of your seasonal wellness routine. After all, many people view the flu shot as a “nice to have” – something that’s beneficial if it fits into the schedule, but not a requirement for good health. But the reality is that the flu vaccine offers critical protection for older adults, whose immune systems may already be compromised by advanced age or chronic illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the flu shot as something people ages 65 and older simply must have. Following are answers to the most common questions about the flu and flu vaccination for older adults, drawn from the most current information available from the CDC.
When exactly is flu season?
The flu season is the time of the year when the seasonal flu is most prevalent – from October to March. It typically peaks around December, and it can persist into May.
Why is the flu vaccine so important for older adults?
People ages 65 and older have a higher risk of serious complications from the flu. Why? Because the immune system naturally becomes weaker with age. And older adults often have the chronic conditions – like lung disease, heart disease or asthma – that can be aggravated by a bout with the flu. The CDC estimates that up to 70 percent of flu-related hospitalizations are among people ages 65 and older. And this age group makes up 85 percent of flu-related deaths. Flu vaccinations can minimize these risks. In fact, the flu vaccine is so important for older adults that a higher-dose version is available to them. This version is shown to provide better immune response and, as a result, better protection against the illness.
Does the flu vaccine really work?
The flu vaccine plays a significant role in preventing the flu. It has shown to be between 70 and 90 percent effective. That’s a lot of sickness prevention. But it’s not an absolute guarantee you won’t get sick. The vaccine doesn’t protect against every strain of the flu. It does, however, offer protection against the most common types of the illness.
Is a shot the only way to get the flu vaccine?
In recent years, both injectable vaccinations (or shots) and an inhaled mist have been available. This year, the CDC is recommending only the injectable versions. Due to concerns about its effectiveness, the nasal spray – or mist – is not recommended. At least for this year, a shot is the only effective option.
If my loved one got a flu shot last year, do we need another one this year?
The immune protection your body develops from the flu vaccine declines over time. In addition, the vaccine is updated each year to protect against new strains of the flu. The CDC recommends getting vaccinated against the flu annually for “optimal” protection.
How do I know if my loved one has already had the flu?
Many people mistake stomach or intestinal conditions with the seasonal flu. But the flu is actually a respiratory disease. While it can be accompanied by symptoms like diarrhea and vomiting, the more prominent symptoms of the flu typically include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headaches, chill and/or fatigue. Your doctor can diagnose the flu by evaluating symptoms, or through a lab test.
If my loved one has already had the flu, can we still get vaccinated?
There are numerous strains of the flu virus. Vaccination can provide protection, even for those who may have already had the flu.
Is there a deadline for vaccinating?
The CDC recommends getting vaccinated by the end of October. But if you miss that window, you can still benefit from the vaccination. As long as a supply is still available, flu shots can be given through January or later. The key is to get vaccinated before exposure to the flu. And the further into the season it gets, the more opportunities there are for exposure. It takes about two weeks after vaccination for the body to have immunity to the flu.
Are there any other vaccinations that are recommended for older adults?
The flu vaccine is just one of the immunizations the CDC recommends for people 65 and older. While you’re getting this year’s flu shot, ask your doctor about these others:
- Pneumococcal Vaccine: The CDC recommends the pneumococcal vaccine to protect against pneumonia, as well as other conditions such as meningitis and bloodstream infections.
- Shingles Vaccine: Caused by the same virus responsible for chickenpox, shingles can be extremely painful and lead to other health complications in older adults. The CDC recommends a shingles vaccination – also referred to as the Zoster vaccine – for adults 65 and older.
- Tdap Vaccine: A combination to protect against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis – otherwise known as whooping cough – Tdap is recommended by the CDC for older adults who have not received the shot since childhood.
Are there other ways to prevent the flu?
While the flu vaccine is the best way to prevent seasonal flu, there are some healthy habits that can help minimize the spread of the illness:
- Steer clear of others who are sick. And if you’re sick, stay home.
- Use a tissue to cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
- Wash your hands often.
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, which are prime entry points for germs.
- Take care of yourself – get plenty of sleep and fluids.
Where can we get vaccinated?

623,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/the-four-hs-in-stroke-risks/,"Knowing stroke risk factors is half the battle.
A stroke, sometimes called a “brain attack,” occurs when blood flow to an area in the brain is cut off. The brain cells, deprived of the oxygen and glucose needed to survive, die. If not caught early, permanent brain damage can result. A stroke can happen to anyone at any time, it doesn’t discriminate between gender, race, or age. The good news, if you know the stroke risk factors, up to 80 percent of them are preventable*.
May is Stroke Awareness Month and it’s important to know the risk factors that can contribute to having stroke, and what we can do to reduce these risks. While many stroke risk factors like cigarette smoking, alcohol usage, and lack of exercise can be controlled and managed, there are four stroke H-risk factors we might not be able to avoid, but with regular doctor visits, proper diet, exercise, and medication management (if necessary) we can control too.
Understanding the four stroke H-risk factors, and if they exist in your life, may help motivate you to take charge and control the ones you can change.
- HEREDITY If anyone in your family, parent, grandparent, sister or brother has had a stroke — especially before reaching age 65 — you may be at greater risk. Sometimes strokes are caused by genetic disorders like CADASIL, which can block blood flow in the brain.
- HEART DISEASE Individuals with coronary heart disease, angina, or who have had a heart attack due to atherosclerosis, have more than twice the risk of stroke than those who haven’t.
- HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE If you or someone in your family has a history of high blood pressure (or hypertension), know your numbers and keep them low. High blood pressure is the leading cause of stroke and the most significant controllable risk factor for stroke.
- HIGH CHOLESTEROL If you have high blood cholesterol, get it under control. People with high blood cholesterol have an increased risk for stroke. Large amounts of cholesterol in the blood can build up and cause blood clots, leading to a stroke.
How can you reduce your risk of having a stroke? Daily exercise, stop smoking, reduce the amount of alcohol in your daily diet, control your diabetes, lower you blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and have regular checkups and proper treatments for the four stroke H-risk factors if you have them.

624,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/the-great-american-smokeout/,"Today, November 15 is the great American Smokeout, a day initiated by the American Cancer Society to bring awareness to a habit that can be life-threatening. Did you know that one in five Americans still smoke? Or that using tobacco is the #1 cause of premature death in the United States?
It’s going to take more than warnings on cigarette packages to get people to quit. Although smoking has been banned in many restaurants and buildings, we know that people who smoke will always find a time or place to smoke. And even though a pack of cigarettes can cost up to $5, true smokers will pay the price no matter what the expense!
At FirstLight Home Care, we’re not here to berate you for your choices. We know it is a habit that is extremely hard to break. Instead, if you have a family member or a friend who smokes, help talk to them TODAY about a plan to quit. And if you’re a smoker, think about how much better you would feel if you quit. No more hacking cough. No more running out of breath when you go up the stairs … and no more nagging from your friends and family!
There are a lot of products on the market today to help smoker’s quit versus trying to go cold turkey. There’s nicotine replacement products to help you get over withdrawals. There’s counseling groups, acupuncturists, hypnotherapists, and more than 32 million websites dedicated to helping you quit.
And did you know if you quit you could save approximately $1,825/year on cigarettes? That money saved could be used for a great vacation!
Although the number one reason to quit os for YOU, think about your children as well. According to the American Cancer Society, 35% of children live in homes where homeowners or visitors are allowed to smoke. About 50 – 75% of children in the U.S. have detectable levels of cotinine, a d product of nicotine in their blood levels. Studies have shown that children exposed to secondhand smoke are at a greater risk for sudden infant death syndrome, respiratory infections, and even asthma.
Our FirstLight Home Care caregivers see the repurcussions of smoking firsthand. Many of our patients suffer from COPD, heart and lung diseases and even strokes brought on by smoking. And what is the resounding reply of most of them? ” I wish I had the willpower to quit before the side effects became debilitating” or “I guess I thought I would be one of the lucky ones who it didn’t catch up with.”
So do yourself and quit for one day. One day could lead to many more. In fact, after just 12 hours without a cigarette, the carbon monoxide levels in your blood will return to normal. After two weeks both your circulation and lung function will improve. And your tastebuds will even return.
You have the willpower to quit … walk away for one day!"
625,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/the-home-care-decision-what-to-look-for-in-a-partner/,"For people who are aging in place, living with a disability, recovering from an illness or injury, or adjusting to a major life transition, navigating the typical activities of daily living can be an ongoing challenge. Home care can be a lifeline. Non-medical home care services provide the assistance people need to maintain their independence in the places where they live, and to enhance their quality of life along the way. This is different from, and in addition to, the more common home health alternative.
Choosing the right care provider partner
Home care is an important partnership between a person in need of assistance – and, often, their families – and a trusted, qualified provider. But when it comes to selecting a home care provider, where should you begin? What should you look for? To ensure you choose the right partner to fit your needs, consider the following characteristics.
- Longevity. The home care segment first emerged about 17 years ago. Look for a provider that has years of experience in the industry.
- Expert caregivers. Key to any home care partnership is the caregiver. It takes a special kind of person to be an effective caregiver – compassionate, sincere, attentive, trustworthy and experienced. Look for providers who have a thorough process for vetting, selecting and retaining caregivers. Background checks, references and applicable experience are critical. And be sure to select a provider that values ongoing caregiver training and that has a clear supervisory process to oversee quality of care.
- Commitment to caregiver fit. Each individual is unique. The most successful client-caregiver relationships are achieved when the caregiver is a good fit for the style, disposition, needs and personality of the individual being cared for. Look for a home care provider that is committed to matching the caregiver to the unique needs of the individual to be served.
- Continuity of care. Once caregiver fit is established, there is value in consistency. Can the provider ensure ongoing access to the same caregiver or team of caregivers? Does the provider’s caregiving team include professionals with tenure? Is sufficient backup available in the event your regular caregiver or team of caregivers become ill or are otherwise unavailable?
- An approach that engages the family. It’s very common for individuals who need assistance maintaining their independence to have a family member or other loved one that provides ongoing support. Home care is an extension of that support. Look for a provider that engages family caregivers in the ongoing care plan.
- A range of services. Home care services vary. Be sure to examine a provider’s service portfolio. Can it meet your initial needs? Will it be flexible to how your needs may evolve over time? Does it meet any special needs you may have, like language requirements? Does it include any unique services or features that will provide you with additional value?
- Availability. Be sure to understand a provider’s availability to meet your service needs. Are services available on nights, weekends and holidays? Is there flexibility in the number of hours required for service or a minimum duration of a service engagement? Is there a way to reach your provider around the clock if you have an emergency? Consider how your needs may evolve over time and whether the provider has the flexibility to evolve with you.
- Client satisfaction feedback. The best home care providers are those that continually assess the quality of care delivery. Does the provider have a clear process for problem resolution? Is there an escalation process for concerns? Are supervisors involved in assessing the quality of care? Will you have the opportunity to participate in surveys or provide feedback?
- Appropriate credentials. It’s important to seek a provider that secures and maintains the applicable licensing to provide services. Licensing requirements vary by state. Providers should also maintain appropriate bonding and insurance.
- Transparent policies. To manage the expectations for the investment required for home care services, make sure you understand a provider’s financial policies. Written estimates and formal billing for services helps keep everyone accountable. Also inquire about policies for things like caregiver support, caregiver conduct and client confidentiality.
- Enthusiastic references. How can you gauge whether a home care partner will live up to its promises? Talk to people who have experience with the provider. Ask the provider to supply references. Or seek recommendations from people within your network, including healthcare providers.
Validating Quality
Once you’ve covered all of your bases, there’s one more thing that’s valuable in the selection of a home care provider: third-party validation of quality. This can come in the form of endorsements, rankings or awards.
FirstLight Home Care is proud to have been recently recognized as one of the top providers in the industry by the 2017 Best of Home Care Awards®. Presented annually by Home Care Pulse, a third-party research and quality assurance home care satisfaction measurement firm, the Best of Home Care Awards are based solely on feedback from clients and employees, making them a meaningful consideration in the selection of a home care provider. Best of Home Care Awards are presented to companies that believe strongly in providing the best home care services and have contracted with Home Care Pulse to effectively measure the quality of care they provide. FirstLight was among the most-awarded providers for all of 2016, with more than one-third of our locations across the United States being recognized with a Best of Home Care Award.

626,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/the-impact-of-spousal-caregiving/,"The number of spousal caregivers in the United States is growing – nearly one-quarter, 22 percent, of the over 40 million caregivers in the United States are the spouse of a chronically ill, disabled or aged partner.
Caregiving to a parent is tough, but when it is a husband, wife, or partner you vowed “in sickness and in health”, this can be put to the test as you get older. There are still the usual challenges that come with caregiving responsibilities but when it’s also your partner in need of the care, this change can impact the marriage relationship, in ways such as:
- Marital Strain: Marriage isn’t always easy and when you add caregiving responsibilities for your spouse to the mix, it can affect your marriage. The care they need can change the dynamics of and put a strain on the relationship by:
- Posing a financial burden
- Cutting into your time together as a couple
- Cutting into the time you have for family matters, such as childcare and housework
- Causing frustration and fatigue
- Causing resentment of the loved one in need
- Creating tension or conflict between your spouse and other family members involved in your partner’s care
- Emotional impacts: Acting as a caregiver for a family loved one of any relationship can be emotionally draining, however, the emotions tied to your spouse can make the responsibilities of their care even more draining. While many seniors who are suffering from debilitating effects of aging or disease also suffer from depression, researchers have found that spousal caregivers may be likely to experience depression at an even higher rate than those for whom they care.
- Feeling of loss: Spousal caregivers often report feeling very alone in their roles, despite spending nearly all their time with their significant other. The change in a relationship where you’re no longer partners but instead, one relies almost completely on the other, can cause the spousal caregiver to struggle with feelings of great loss, as if they’re suddenly caring for a completely different person. The associated loss of companionship and intimacy can also be devastating. Spousal caregivers can also grow to resent the needier member of the relationship.
- Physical and emotional issues: Emotional strain can have an undeniable impact on the physical well-being of the spousal caregiver. The feelings of anger, anxiety, sadness, isolation, exhaustion – and the guilt for having these feelings – can take its toll. It’s important to recognize the emotional signs of caregiver stress and to seek help or support:
- Moodiness or mood swings
- Poor sleeping patterns
- Increased blood pressure
- Weight gain or loss
- Argumentative
- Irritability and feelings of frustration
- Memory problems and lack of concentration
- Headaches or physical symptoms
When you are a caregiver for your spouse, it is important to carve out time for yourself. It should be a priority to find respite care services in your local area to support you. Respite care is necessary for the health and well-being of the family or spousal caregiver to ensure that they can continue to provide care for their loved one. Respite care includes a variety of services such as home-based care, skilled nursing, dementia care, and companion care. A FirstLight® Home Care caregiver can help with everything from physical tasks to errands, meal preparation, senior transportation and more.

627,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/the-importance-of-independence/,"This week, I read an article about the increasing number of seniors having joint replacement surgery. The article, “Old Patients, New Joints,” written by Paula Span for The New York Time’s blog, The New Old Age, featured a series of individuals who have recently experienced hip or knee replacement surgery as well as useful advice from a number of doctors.
What I found really endearing about this article, is how much people value their independence – their ability to live their lives – no matter their age and no matter what they have to do to achieve it. One woman featured in the article was an avid tennis player and skier, until the pain in her hip made it impossible to do so. At age 76, she elected to have hip joint replacement surgery so that she could continue to do the things she loved. After spending some time recovering, she was back to her normal life. Recently, her other hip has begun to have the same issues. If it can’t be improved through medication, she’s already decided to undergo a second replacement.
No matter the age, no matter the obstacles, people will always strive to do what makes them happy. It doesn’t have to be something as physically active as tennis. Many find joy in going down to the local park; others find it by going to a friend’s house for a visit. No matter what it is, it’s important to everyone and if something like an aching hip or knee is getting in the way, most individuals have a desire to correct the problem so they can go on doing what they love.
Unfortunately, many people who can’t walk or move comfortably are fearful of having such an invasive surgery because of the, often times, long recovery period. That’s why the services offered by in-home care providers, such as FirstLight Home Care, are extremely important; they offer a sense of hope and relief so that those who are suffering can take care of the problem, have a speedy recovery, and get on with their lives.
While confronting issues that hinder anyone’s golden years is never easy, it’s comforting to know that there’s always a way to solve them. To find more information about in-home care services, check out our resource center at the FirstLight Resources Page."
628,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/the-importance-of-oral-health-and-hygiene-as-we-age/,"October is Dental Hygiene Month
A century ago, the need for dentures later in life was considered a natural part of aging. Today, three-quarters of people over the age of 65 retain at least some of their natural teeth. While the improvement in oral health care among seniors is something to smile about, our aging loved ones still need to be diligent when it comes to their teeth.
Even with regular brushing and flossing, older people still have higher rates of gum disease, dental decay, oral cancer, mouth infections, and tooth loss. Our team at FirstLight® addressed several oral health and hygiene issues that can help seniors maintain a healthy smile as they age.
TOOTH DECAY: Tooth decay can lead to cavities, which can cause pain, infection, and even tooth loss. Most often, tooth decay is caused by a build-up of plaque and tartar. A diet with sugary foods, snacking between meals (and not brushing after), and a decrease in saliva production due to medication or medical conditions can be the main culprits of tooth decay.
Prevention is the best approach. Brush teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste, decrease the number of sugary foods you intake and drink water after each meal. Other things you can do include:
- Switch to an electric toothbrush for an easier, more effective way to clean your teeth and gums
- Talk to your dentist about fluoride rinse options
- Consider fillings and/or crowns to slowdown advanced tooth decay
GUM DISEASE: Periodontal disease, also known as gum disease, is caused by bacteria in plaque and tartar. It is a potentially serious condition that can affect people of all ages, but especially those over 60. Several factors can increase the severity of gum disease, including:
- Poor diet
- Poor oral hygiene
- Systemic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer
- Environmental factors, such as stress and smoking
- Certain medications
The good news with gum disease is that it is both preventable and treatable if treated early.
RECEDING GUMS: Receding gums is a gradual process where gums shrink away from teeth. Poor dental hygiene, family history, smoking and teeth grinding can contribute to receding gums. When your gums recede, your teeth become sensitive and the root of the tooth becomes exposed, which can lead to damage to your oral tissues and an increased likelihood of developing gum disease and tooth loss. Avoid receding gums by doing these simple things:
- Visit your dentist every 6 months
- Don’t smoke
- Avoid sugary foods
- Talk to your dentist about treatment options such as a deep cleaning or scaling
DRY MOUTH: Some people experience a decrease in saliva production as they age. This can cause dry mouth. When ignored, dry mouth can result in dry, cracked lips and a swollen tongue, making it difficult to speak and swallow. It can also lead to cavities. Also be aware that some medications our elderly loved ones are taking can be the root cause of this condition.
To reduce dry mouth, you should:
- Drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day
- Avoid sugary foods and drinks
- Chew gum and consume lozenges
- Use a mouth rinse recommended by your dentist to help prevent acid build-up
ORAL CANCER: As we age, the chance of oral cancer increases. The American Cancer Society reports that more than half of all oral cancer patients are 65 years of age and older. Therefore, the older you get, the more important it becomes to take care of your oral health. Keep you and your mouth healthy with these tips:
- Don’t smoke
- Protect your lips from lip cancer by limiting exposure to the sun and using a lip balm with sunscreen
- Eat a healthy, balanced diet
- Get regular dental examinations that include oral cancer screenings
- Regularly check your mouth at home. If you notice anything new or different, visit your dentist to have it checked
Your teeth can last a lifetime with proper home care and regular dental checkups. No matter what your age, you can keep your teeth and gums healthy by brushing twice a day with fluoride toothpaste, flossing daily and seeing your dentist regularly for professional cleanings and checkups.

629,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/the-mystery-of-the-observation-status/,"Come to find out, Martha has been an observation patient this entire time and never admitted as an inpatient! Since she has not had 3 consecutive inpatient days, Medicare will not pay for her to go to the rehabilitation center. Obviously, we were never informed she was considered an observation patient and after this length of time in the hospital and with all of the treatments who would of guessed. The medical social worker informed us the hospital was not required by CMS to make the family aware and that she had given Martha a paper earlier in the week which made her aware.
Now mind you Martha has advanced Alzheimer’s disease and I really thought this woman standing in front of me with a masters in social work was intelligent; obviously my mistake. Oh it gets better; the MSW continues to tell us that it is very rare for a patient who is made observation is admitted as an inpatient. I am now biting my tongue until I think it is going to bleed. I asked her when Martha’s doctor would be in to see her and her response was, “talking to him will not make any difference”. My underlying response was to choke her but I simply replied that I appreciated her perspective; however, I would discuss Martha’s situation with him.
Interestingly, Martha’s daughter and myself have both been involved in the medical field for years. We were aware of the observation status; however, understood it to be for only a 24 to 48 hour stay. After some research it appears this is one of the ways hospitals and the CMS (Medicare) are cutting costs. They will charge these patients who paid into Medicare for services they now need the most. This includes stays in the hospital, the physical and occupational therapy and rehabilitation they need. Where is the justice here!
Martha and her husband both worked their entire lives; thus paid into the Medicare system for a very long time, as did so many others. Because Medicare is tightening their belts, a game of “observation status” has begun. Everything that was told to us was sad but true. If Martha were indigent she would be on Medicaid and the scenario would be different.
We knew we could not take Martha home. She is too fragile and frail. The hospital told us she has been fine since she was admitted. I had to sarcastically say back that it doesn’t take too much strength and endurance to lie in bed and walk to the bathroom; however, both of our homes have steps and much more distance from one room to another. My next statement pushed a button as some changes in attitude started to occur. What I told them was that if she were discharged to us she would be back in the Emergency Department within 24 hours. I was telling the truth since my fear was she would collapse again especially if she did not have some therapy.
What happened next was like a miracle. Suddenly Martha had been made an inpatient since Sunday, she was getting more tests to determine what made her collapse and at last she was going to get rehab. Being a persistent advocate for your family or getting the help from experts for your loved ones is what we who are caregivers must do!"
630,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/the-perfect-gift-for-fathers-day/,"It’s that time of year when sons and daughters flock to buy Hallmark cards for their dad and try and find the perfect gift. Maybe you’re thinking about a shirt, but that will probably just add to the unworn selection already in his closet. Or maybe you’re considering golf balls, because you know how many he loses in his zest to lower his handicap.
You’re probably thinking “if he wants something he goes and buys it” or “he has everything he needs”.
Do you remember what you got your Dad for Father’s day last year? Chances are he doesn’t either. Or for that matter, for his birthday or the holidays? Because you see, these are just things and most of us have too many things. When you get older you have too many possessions, accumulated over a lifetime of places you’ve been and people you have met. His man cave or garage is probably cluttered and your Mom has been nagging him to clean it out.
That’s why the most important gift you can give your Dad is not something you can buy in a store or on the Internet. It’s the gift of your time. With our hectic lifestyles, time can be more precious than anything else these days.
I don’t mean time running errands or going to doctor’s appointments. I mean time spent creating great memories together. Some of my favorite memories with my dad are the golf trips we took or just reminiscing. Last year I converted all our picture albums to digital and made a slide show. I set it to some of his favorite song (yes, Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley). It had over 1,000 pictures! We spent the day together laughing at how we changed over the years, our funny haircuts, our out-of-date fashions and some of the crazy things we did.
This year I am converting our VHS tapes to DVD, so we can really laugh at our home movies. Can you believe they had no sound on their cameras in those days? How far we have come!
Maybe you can’t be with your father on this special day. That’s okay too – give him an I.O.U. On your next visit, remember your goal is to spend quality time together.
Maybe your Dad is elderly and has trouble getting to his “Honey Do” list. Help him make any of the minor repairs he needs around the house. Wash his windows. Clean his car. Change all the batteries in his smoke detectors. Put new light bulbs in areas he can’t reach with his ladder. Plant some new flowers in his garden. He might be too proud to ask for help, so you’re volunteering can go a long way.
The perfect Father’s Day gift for your Dad is not store bought – it comes from your heart.
Happy Father’s Day from FirstLight Home Care!"
631,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/the-sandwich-generation-the-new-normal/,"Have you heard of the term “The Sandwich Generation?” Well, if you haven’t up until now, then you’ll probably start to hear it more and more. Heck, you might even be a member of The Sandwich Generation and you don’t even know it.
It’s a term that I find extremely accurate and descriptive once you understand the context of which it’s used. So what exactly does it mean?
The Sandwich Generation is a generation of people who care for their agingparents while supporting their own children.
Dorothy A. Miller coined the term “sandwich generation” back in 1981, and Carol Abaya has continued to study and expose what it means to millions of Americans.
Carol Abaya, M.A., is nationally recognized as an expert on the sandwich generation, aging and elder/parent care issues. As a journalist, she has written about aging issues for more than 20 years. Her magazine, The Sandwich Generation®, was the first to talk about the challenges of elder/parent care. (To learn more about Carol and her efforts, visit her website, www.sandwichgeneration.com.)
Carol Abaya categorized the different scenarios involved in being a part of the sandwich generation.
- Traditional: those sandwiched between aging parents who need care and/or help and their own children.
- Club Sandwich: those in their 50s or 60s sandwiched between aging parents, adult children and grandchildren, or those in their 30s and 40s, with young children, aging parents and grandparents.
- Open Faced: anyone else involved in elder care.
Merriam-Webster and Oxford English officially added the term to their dictionaries in 2006, and Carol also coined the words “club sandwich generation” and “open face sandwich generation.” Some day, they may also find their way into these prestigious dictionaries.
With all of the definitions and persons responsible for coining the terms aside, what does this term mean to you? If you are a part of The Sandwich GenerationÒ, you know that it means you are playing a huge game of tug-o-war. It’s a tug-o-war between your aging parents and your children for your time, care, love and attention. And, that doesn’t even go into the stress that comes with caring for your loved ones financially.
The major news networks have even been covering it since the situation it describes has become more and more commonplace. Click on both links below to learn more about The Sandwich Generation and what others in this situation are doing to cope. CNNMoney posted an excellent article on it back in 2007, and CBS did an intriguing news segment on it back in 2009."

When the word “cancer” is used in a sentence that’s associated with someone you love, it becomes surreal and bizarre. However—now more than ever—you can’t allow that to skew the important decisions ahead.
Until it hits home, when you hear of people with cancer, you think, “How awful.” In the back of your mind, you say a silent prayer: “Please, God, don’t ever let that happen to me or my family.” We offer prayers and to help in any way possible. I never expected my husband to be diagnosed, much less in his forties.
There’s more. Everything related to cancer treatment will move much slower than you think it should. If you’re an action person like I am, you will live in continuous frustration wanting to do something right now. From diagnosis to treatment and through to the hope of remission, it will seem like time stands still or goes way too fast. And, there are the emotions…

Because you’re in shock, you have the mental capacity of a two-year-old child. (No offense intended.) You’re in no position to make big decisions, but you may have to. Take a deep breath, dive in, and ask for support from other resources. Don’t make any rash decisions or harsh assumptions, but don’t leave the decisions to others. Take them one at a time. They’re easier to focus on that way. If you feel overwhelmed, say so. If you need clarification, say so. If you don’t understand, say so. You have everything to gain or everything to lose.
2) You are in crisis.
A crisis is a turning point, one that denotes a pivotal change in your life. This is different from any crisis you’ve been through before. This crisis won’t go away. Right now there is no cure for cancer, but there are many people who lead normal lives in remission. Regardless of the outcome, your life has changed. Move forward, even if you start with baby steps. Try to be strong and in control.
3) You must maintain your power.
The definition of helpless is as follows: “lacking protection or support; defenseless.” You are neither lacking in support nor defenseless. In a cancer crisis, the definition of helpless should be “lacking information needed to reach a lifesaving goal.” The cancer patient and his or her family have a say in all decisions, right or wrong. There is no preset treatment for any type of cancer. Pay close attention, ask for multiple recommendations, and stay grounded. But under no circumstances should you relinquish your power.
4) Prepare with knowledge and by surrounding yourself with the best of the best!
Your family and friends can help you sort through the mass quantity of information that is available to cancer patients. It is possible that some of them work in the medical field. Do your homework. Knowledge is your armor, just as treatment is your weapon. There are many resources available, especially in this age of the Internet and worldwide information. Many newly diagnosed cancer patients shy away from other resources while putting their faith solely on the shoulders of their medical team. This includes shutting out other patients who have gone through treatment for that same type of cancer. Don’t! It’s productive to listen and learn before you decide what is best for you.
5) If your doctor attempts to tell you the outcome…
At the outset, no one knows what will happen—good or bad. The doctor can no more tell you the final outcome than Madame Rue, the fortune teller. We were originally told that after six months of radiation, chemo, and a stem cell transplant—then poof, my husband would be as good as new. It didn’t happen! Things can go wrong; things can go right. You need a healthcare team that can deal with that. Every patient is different. Who hasn’t known of patients whose doctors told them they would only live months, but they lived years? You’re not stamped with an expiration date.
6) The devil is in the details.
Our first indication that we were not originally at the right treatment facility for Gordon’s cancer treatment was the lack of organization between the different types of oncologists responsible for his care. There were actually times that I was the one making the recommendations. No, I don’t have a medical degree, but someone had to break through. You need to listen and take an active role in cancer treatment, not passive.
The Saving of Gordon: Lifelines to W-I-N Against Cancer
Based on Joni’s experience and years of research, this inspirational and informative book is designed to give families a fighting chance in their own cancer battle.
Connecting Through Compassion: Guidance for Family and Friends of a Brain Cancer Patient—Joni’s co-author on this book for caregivers of a primary or metastatic brain cancer patient is an MS in counseling and an expert on brain illnesses. You may not be able to bring the patient back into our world, but you can visit them in theirs. The last weeks of Gordon’s life were so traumatic for Joni that it two years of counseling to heal the wounds. The advice in this book could have made all of the difference.
Would you like to send something special to someone that’s going through a health-related hardship this holiday season? Instead of a poinsettia or fruitcake, why not send them a Basket of Care (www.BasketofCare.com)? These baskets are lovingly designed by a cancer survivor, and chock full of items that will lend comfort. Care baskets include such items as warm blankets, angels, slipper socks, hope messages, note cards, and books by Joni Aldrich. Or what about a “Day at the Beach” basket for a child who is ill? A Basket of Care is just the way to say, “I care” over the holidays."
633,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/things-keep-getting-better/,"The past few weeks have been packed with news stories about seniors interacting with today’s technology and living it up. Some have connected with their families in brand new ways, and others have started doing the activities they have loved for years.
This side of 20 years ago, seniors were much more limited in what they could do, mostly because of health concerns. Almost any sport was out of the question due to the possibility of injury, and health care was not as advanced as it is today.
Now, people can enjoy their golden years in ways they never thought possible. There’s Virginia Campbell, a woman who loved reading, but due to glaucoma, could barely see a book. Thanks to her iPad, she’s been able to rediscover her favorite pastime, and has even started writing poems. On top of this, due to the iPad being so user friendly, seniors are able to quickly email their loved ones.
Sports, such as bowling, can be extremely difficult to older individuals, and potentially dangerous. Thanks to the Nintendo Wii, all manner of sports are at seniors’ fingertips. They can bowl, play tennis, pitch a baseball, and even hunt, all from the comfort of their own homes. Because of this, many recreational centers have started sports leagues, encouraging older men and women to become more social.
Best of all, seniors are healthier today than they have ever been, thanks to modern health care technology. Doctors are better able to care for their patients, and seniors are more educated on keeping up their health, giving them the freedom to do more than their parents could have. Just ask the Independence Village Steel Drum and Rhythm Band in Michigan. The 14 member band is made completely of senior citizens and loves to perform for anyone.
These types of stories always bring a smile to my face. The main reason we created FirstLight Home Care was to improve the quality of life for those who needed a helping hand, and now more than ever, people are able to live their lives to the fullest. Best of all, it’s getting better every day."
634,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/thinking-about-senior-care-for-your-aging-parents/,"Maybe your parents should no longer drive or have mobility issues. Maybe your Mom or Dad has dementia and needs constant monitoring. Whatever the case, baby boomers handling care for an elderly relative has become the “new normal.”
In fact, more than 43.5 million Americans are caring for someone older than 50, according to the Family Caregiver Alliance. Whereas your parents used to take care of you, you may now find the roles reversed – you are now considering how to take care of them. How could you not? They loved you and provided for you all those years so now it’s your turn to do the same.
With more than 10,000 baby boomers turning 65 every day, you might be a caregiver while needing some care yourself as your health needs change. Or, perhaps your parents live in one city and you live in another; across town or across the country.
Whatever the circumstances, there may be some medical and financial decisions in your future that can dramatically affect your family dynamics and emotional and financial health.
Albeit no one wants to talk about aging and even dying, you need to have a plan in place before a crisis develops.
As senior care specialists, here are some things that FirstLight Home Care recommends you consider for your aging parents:
- Housing options. Do your parents want to remain in their home with affordable in-home care? If so, is their home safe or do adjustments need to be made to prevent falls? If not, which type of living situation might be best for them: nursing home, retirement or independent living community, skilled care facility or group home?
- Transportation. Can your parents see well enough to drive? Do they have reliable transportation to get to all their doctor visits, shopping, running errands and visiting with family and friends? Who is the backup driver?
- Legal: Do your parents have an advanced directive or medical and mental health powers of attorney in case they become ill? Do you know where they keep important documents such as a will and insurance paperwork?
- Financial: Do your parents need help getting their pension or government benefits? Do they have long term care insurance? What is their financial situation both now and in the future? Is all their financial information in one place?
Also, it’s important to know what resources are available to help. At FirstLight Home Care, we are very aware of the many senior resources available throughout the country, and would be happy to steer you in the right direction. Don’t go it alone … there are many people who have the knowledge you need at their fingertips and can make it easier to take care of your aging parents for you. We’re FirstLight and we’re here to help."
635,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/three-early-signs-of-dementia/,"So, it’s a Saturday and you have just taken your mom out for a nice lunch. Your elderly mom however cannot remember where she put her checkbook. And, she tripped a couple times as you brought her back to her house. You also noticed that she seemed distant at lunch, and you caught her staring off into nowhere several times.
None of these things should be a cause for alarm, right? Geez, even I misplace my car keys about once a day. However, as our parents and loved ones age, the occurrence of these events could be early signs of dementia depending on their frequency.
Many times family members aren’t aware of the early signs of dementia, so they can easily be overlooked and/or dismissed. That’s why as a in-home care company who sees patients and their families dealing with this awful disease everyday, FirstLight Home Care would like to share with you with a few early signs of dementia that you can be on the look out for with your parents and loved ones.
Frequent Falling*
Constantly tripping over your own two feet? Everyone falls now and again — but frequent falling could be an early signal of Alzheimer’s disease, according to new research. The researchers, who presented the study at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Paris, looked at brain scans of 125 older adults and also asked them to keep track of how often they slipped and stumbled during an eight-month span. The results? Those participants who showed early signs of Alzheimer’s also happened to fall down more often.
Staring*
“Reduced gaze” is the clinical term for the dementia symptom that alters people’s ability to move their eyes normally. People showing early signs of dementia look like they’re staring a lot. They try to read, and they skip lines. This is one of the signs of dementia that the patient might not completely be aware of, although people around them probably will be.
Losing Knowledge*
Now and again, most people find themselves desperately searching for the right word. In fact, failing to find the word you are thinking of is surprisingly common and not necessarily a sign of dementia. But losing knowledge of objects — not just what they are called, but also what they are used for — is an early dementia symptom. Oddly enough, people who are losing this knowledge can be very competent in other areas of their lives."
636,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/three-things-can-today-help-eyes/,"Diminished eyesight is a growing problem – especially among aging American adults. Approximately 142 million U.S. citizens 40 and older have vision problems and by age 75, the American Academy of Ophthalmology indicates 70 percent of adults will develop cataracts. This occurs when the lens of your eyes become cloudy from age, poor eye health, and environmental factors; resulting in blurred, dim, or discolored vision and even blindness. Maintaining senior eye health is increasingly important as we age and the caregivers at FirstLight Home Care are committed to helping seniors with their vision difficulties.
As a way to emphasize the importance of eye health, June has been deemed National Cataract Awareness Month. As home care providers, we’ve witnessed the results of this damaging condition and can offer these three tips to help prevent cataracts from happening to you:
- Wear sunglasses: One of the reasons June is Cataract Awareness Month is the summer sun and the damaging effects it can have on one’s eyes. Ultraviolet radiation can affect your eyes in a similar fashion as it can your skin; the Sun’s rays can burn your corneas and other area of the eyes in much the same way that sunburn can damage your skin. . Sun damage to your eyes may not show immediate effects; however, it can break down the lenses in your eyes through long-term exposure. Wearing sunglasses that are 100 percent UV-absorbent is an easy way to help slow the possibilities of developing cataracts.
- Limit cigarettes: Heavy smokers are at a much higher risk of developing cataracts compared to non-smokers, so try and limit your exposure. The free radicals in tobacco smoke that irritate your eyes are also damaging to the lenses in your eyes. In addition, your body’s antioxidant count is diminished when you smoke, lessening the strength of your eyes and increasing the chances of developing cataracts as a result.
- Get nutrients: A poor diet can go a long way toward poor well-being – especially when it comes to your eyes. A lack of vitamins C and E, beta-carotene and selenium will increase your chances of developing cataracts as will diabetes. Your eyes’ lenses get their nutrients from a fluid secreted from the ciliary epithelium – aqueous humor – and when you don’t have control over your glucose levels, the amount of sugar in the fluid increases, causing the lens to swell. This is why it’s important to eat nutrient dense foods like leafy greens and colorful fruits and vegetables.
Taking stock in senior eye health doesn’t have to be difficult, it simply takes a few little things here and there to live with better sight. Encouraging your loved ones to do the same can help them age healthier and more comfortably. If you have a question about preventing cataracts for the seniors in your life, or other topics related to caregiving, contact our “Just Ask FirstLight” service today to get answers from one of our experienced health care professionals."
637,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/tips-for-caring-for-an-adult-with-disabilities/,"March is Disabilities Awareness Month. If you are a family member who cares for someone with a disability, whether a child or an adult, handling personal, caregiving, and everyday needs is hard work.
Home care services are not limited to seniors – adults with chronic needs or disabilities can benefit from a professional caregiver to help them live independently and help you keep stress at bay.
Our FirstLight caregivers support families with family members who are autistic and those with Down’s syndrome, Cerebral Palsy, and other intellectual and developmental disabilities. Working closely with these local families, they have found the following caring tips to be extremely helpful for you and your disabled loved one.
Educate Yourself. Gather as much information about the family member’s condition. Meet with their health advisors and specialists to understand their situation today and what to expect in the future. Becoming more informed will help you make more knowledgeable health decisions and improve your understanding of any challenges your family might face.
Grow Your Support Group. Family members and friends can provide support in a variety of ways and oftentimes want to help, but not sure how to ask. Determine what you need and give specific instruction on how they can assist you and your family.
- You and the disabled loved one should join a local or online support group based on their needs and interests. A support group can give you the chance to share information and connect with people who are going through similar experiences. A support group may help you overcome the isolation and fear you may experience as a caregiver.
- Search for local and national groups that provide services, recreation, and information for people with disabilities.
- Ask for help and support from friends, family, health care providers, and counselors to join your family care team.
Be an Advocate. The family member with a disability will need advocates to ensure that they receive the best service, support, education, and care he or she needs.
- Familiarize yourself, and other family members, with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Family Medical Leave Act, and other state and national provisions. Knowing how and when to apply them to your specific situation could be the best thing you do.
- Keep other caregivers and health providers of any special conditions or circumstances that could negatively impact them.
- Keep documents of his or her medical history current.
- Be an advocate for yourself and let your employer know your situation. Be open and discuss what you need to be able to support your loved one.
Remember Self Care. Caregiving is hard work. Caring for a family member with a disability can be very rewarding, but also extremely challenging. It is important that you stay healthy for yourself and for those in your care.
- Set time for yourself to read a book, go for a walk, or take a nap.
- Ask for help or hire an in-home caregiver, like FirstLight Home Care to help you with companion or personal care services on a daily or weekly need. We provide meal preparation, transportation, housekeeping, and assistance with hygiene, other personal care, and more.
- Make “respite care” part of your vocabulary. Schedule breaks or vacations so that you can get refreshed and be an even better caregiver.
- Keep on top of your physical and mental health.
- Exercise and eat right.
- Spend time with your family and friends.
Families with a loved one living with a disability in their care play an important role in their life. The care you provide allows them to maintain a sense of independence and remain in their home. Adding services that a non-medical home care provider brings to your family can support the quality of life of the disabled and help you to allow them to grow and experience life to their fullest.

638,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/tips-for-communicating-with-an-alzheimers-patient/,"Here at FirstLight Home Care, we work with lots of families caring for loved ones with many different diseases and disabilities. One disease that is particularly heart wrenching to watch and personally endure is Alzheimer’s. I have asked myself this question many times…as I get older “would I rather lose my physical capabilities or my memory?” That’s definitely not a fair choice to make. And, unfortunately we don’t get the choice. Life happens as it’s going to happen, and then in order to move on, we have to learn to adapt to a “new normal.” But, after talking to many families with loved ones dealing with Alzheimer’s, I am not sure if one can call day-to-day interactions with them to be a “new normal.” From one day to the next, life and their memory can be drastically different. It is extremely stressful and emotional for the families, as well as the patients.
The caregivers and families of Alzheimer’s patients have to relearn how to communicate with them. There are many questions to be asked about Alzheimer’s, and I would highly suggest that families with loved ones who are newly diagnosed with Alzheimer’s to also seek local support groups. Speaking to others dealing with the same situation can be very informative and therapeutic.
I would like to share with you some excellent communication tips from Carole Larkin’s blog post on the Alzheimer’s Reading Room. The Alzheimer’s Reading Room is the number one source of life news and information for the entire Alzheimer’s and Dementia community. The goal of the Alzheimer’s Reading Room is to Educate and Empower Alzheimer’s caregivers, families, and the entire Alzheimer’s community.
Tips for communicating with a mid-stage (or later) Alzheimer’s patients:
- Make eye contact. Always approach them face-to-face and make eye contact. Use their name if you need to. It is vital that they actually see you and that their attention is focused on you. Read their eyes. Always approach from the front as approaching and speaking from the side or from behind can startle them.
- Be at their level. Move your head to be at the same level as their head. Bend your knees or sit down to reach their level. Do not stand or hover over them – it is intimidating and scary. They can’t focus on you and what you are saying if they are focused on their fear.
- Tell them what you are going to do before you do it. Particularly if you are going to touch them. They need to know what is coming first so that they don’t think that you are grabbing them.
- Speak calmly. Always speak in a calm manner with an upbeat tone of voice, even if you don’t feel that way. If you sound angry or agitated, they will often mirror that feeling back to you and then some.
- Speak slowly. Speak at one half of your normal speed when talking to them. Take a breath between each sentence. They cannot process words as fast as non-diseased people can. Give them a chance to catch up to your words.
- Speak in short sentences. Speak in short direct sentences with only one idea to a sentence. Usually they can only focus on only one idea at a time.
- Only ask one question at a time. Let them answer it before you ask another question. You can ask who, what, where and when, but NOT why. Why is too complicated. They will try to answer, fail and get frustrated.
- Don’t say “remember.” Many times they will not be able to do so, and you are just pointing out to them their shortcomings. That is insulting, and can cause anger and/or embarrassment.
- Turn negatives into positives. For example say “Let’s go here” instead of “Don’t go there”. Be inclusive and don’t talking down to them as if they were a child. Respect the fact that they are an adult, and treat them as such.
- Do not argue with them. It gets you nowhere. Instead, validate their feelings, by saying” I see that you are angry (sad, upset, etc…). It lets them know that they are not alone and then redirect them into another thought. For example “It sounds like you miss your mother (husband, father, etc…). You love them very much, don’t you? Tell me about the time…” Then ask for one of their favorite stories about that person)."
639,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/tips-for-traveling-with-your-elderly-parents/,"Are you about to head out on a family adventure with your elderly parents? Read these four travel tips to ensure a safe, stress-free vacation.
- Research and plan: Planning, reserving and confirming must be accomplished in advance to make the most of the trip. Establish a trip itinerary that allows everyone to contribute and that also clarifies the activities planned for each day. Make sure to build in down time in case your parents need some extra rest. Make hotel reservations, and reserve event tickets, passes and dining reservations in advance to avoid long lines, changes or disruptions to the days plans. If your elderly parents require wheelchair assistance or access during the trip, inquire about such services and special accommodations in advance.
- Safety, security and comfort: Traveling by air is much different than it used to be. Increased security measures meant to keep people safe have created longer lines at airport Plan to have everyone arrive at least two hours in advance of any departure. If possible, always book a non-stop, direct flight to your destination. Encourage your elderly parents to wear a money belt or neat Passage Wallet hidden under clothing. These are great security measures to keep money and identification secure and out of the hands of thieves. Don’t skimp on comfort while traveling. Consider the purchase of a travel pillow, a c-shaped balloon that supports the neck and head when resting aboard transportation.
- Keep all necessary identification and documents in a safe place: Collect all identification necessary for travel, such as passports and driver’s licenses, as well as documents such as insurance papers, prescriptions and other medical information (example: Doctor and Pharmacy phone numbers) from your family members and keep them together with your tickets and itineraries. If you are traveling with an elderly family member or adult with dementia or any other form of cognitive impairment, you should consider having them wear special identification bracelets with GPS chips in case they wander off or they get separated from the family.
- Arrange medication management and identify local medical facilities: Most older adults take five or more medications once or even several times a day. Make sure to pack enough medication for the entire trip and a couple of extra days in case unexpected delays returning home occur. Always put a few days of medication in your carry-on bag in case your luggage does not make it to your vacation destination. Road trips can have everyone off their regular routine. Consider providing your aging parent with an alarm watch and set reminder alerts to take their necessary medication. If you are traveling to a location you are not familiar with, do some research to find out where health care facilities are located should an emergency occur.

640,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/tips-on-caring-for-your-aging-parents-long-distance/,"For many adult children, caring for their aging parents long distance is just a fact of life. You may live in one place, but your parents live thousands of miles away. You can’t pick up and move because of work or other family commitments. Talking on the phone daily is not the same as seeing them in person; you can’t judge for yourself how they are really doing.
You are not alone. According to a study by Met Life, more than 80% of long distance care providers are working either full or part-time and more than four in ten had to rearrange their work schedules in order to take care of their caregiving responsibilities. Additionally, more than a third (36%) reported missing days of work, and 12% took a leave of absence.
Long distance caregiving can take a toll on you professionally, financially, and personally; but with a lot of planning it can work.
Here are some tips to make long distance caregiving easier on both you and your parents:
- Gather all important documents. These include all legal, personal, medical, financial, and insurance documents. Legal might include powers of attorney, medical proxy, wills, and trusts. Personal would involve a Social Security cards, driver’s licenses, marriage license, military discharge documents, and birth certificates. Before a crisis occurs, get a copy of all bank account numbers, prior tax filings, credit cards, sources of income (including Medicare and pensions where applicable), all assets and debits, and monthly bills. Medical information you should know includes insurance, doctor information, all medications, and the phone number and address for a local pharmacy. For insurance, don’t forget medical, homeowners, car, and life insurance policies.
- Develop a network. Depending on how far away you live, you might not be able to get there in an emergency. Therefore, establish a relationship with your parents’ neighbors, friends, or clergy members who can help. This person could also be designated to look in on your parents every once in awhile or share a meal with them. You will be amazed how eager people are to help if you ask them! If possible, see if your parents will allow you to give them a key.
- Make your time together count. When you go to see your parents, it can be more than just a social visit. It’s a great time to check up on them. Tell them you are tired and ask them to drive to the grocery store … do they get easily confused? Are their reflexes good enough to be driving? It might be a good idea to schedule an appointment at the dentist, eye doctor, family doctor and any specialists they are seeing while you are in town. That way you will know what is going on.
- Check out the house. Falls are all too frequent amongst the elderly. Do they have any loose carpeting or handrails that could cause a fall? Do they have light bulbs that need to be replaced or smoke detector batteries that are inactive? Ensure they have grab bars outside the shower, perhaps even a shower stool inside the shower. While you are there, you might be recruited to be a handyman. Work with the local fire department to install an emergency lock-box.
- Use technology. Many parents are in touch with today’s technology. With a little help, you can show them how to use Skype or Face Time so you can see for yourself how they are doing. Additionally, consider a medical alert monitoring system in case of an emergency. Today’s alerts have options that include automatic fall detection and GPS locator service.
At FirstLight Home Care, we can pinch hit for you when you can’t be there. Our companion care, dementia care, and personal care services ensure that your parents remain independent in their home for as long as possible. If not regular in-home care, we can provide a medical alert system. We are only a phone call away, offer a plethora of services and resources, and we are available 24/7!"
641,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/tips-to-maintain-your-support-network/,"Having close friends and family is an important part of life. We spend years building the friendships and relationships that carry through our adult years. Social lives keep people happier and provide us with a safe haven from day-to-day stresses and challenges.
But as people age, friends can start dropping away. People move on or their lives come to an end. It’s also not out of the question to see formerly close friends and family members grow distant as caregiving eats into your time and energy.
Caregiving can be stressful. But remember that friends are a precious resource.
It’s never too late to strengthen and maintain your support network, whether it’s fostering friendships, getting out of the house, or joining a family caregiver support group, you can start today.

Cold weather, ice, snow, and limited daylight hours can make a simple trip across town a long and exhausting journey. You need to be prepared. Here are some helpful tips to help you get your car ready for winter travel:
- Make your own or purchase a pre-made car weather safety kit. This kit should include: first-aid kit, jumper (booster) cables, tow ropes, cat litter (or something to gain traction under your tires if stuck somewhere slippery), a windshield scraper, candle, and matches.
- Check your tires well before the winter season begins. Be sure the tread on your tires is good enough to last throughout the entire season. Install chains on the tires if necessary.
- Blankets and warm clothing. If you are stuck in your car – you need to stay warm. Get blankets or sleeping bags such as a space blanket and place them in the trunk of your car.
- Flashlight with extra batteries.
- Pack water and snacks. Keeping warm is important, but so is staying hydrated and maintaining your energy. Keep water and snacks inside the car or in the passenger compartment, as they might freeze in the trunk.
- Keep your gas tank near full to avoid ice in the tank and fuel lines.
- Try to avoid traveling alone – especially in unfamiliar places.
- Let someone know your timetable and primary and alternate routes.
- The months between November and April can be one of the busiest road trip seasons. America’s highways are jammed even when temperatures plunge and driving conditions can be challenging. If you find yourself hitting the road during adverse conditions, remember to get your car ready so that you have a safe and comfortable drive wherever the road takes you."

As a die-hard smoker myself for 20 years, I know how hard it is to quit smoking. Nicotine is an addiction like no other! In fact, it’s two addictions: a physical addiction to nicotine and a psychological addiction to daily smoking rituals. It is estimated that most smokers will attempt to quit two or three times, or more, before finally kicking the habit. I have tried a variety of methods to quit – unsuccessfully I might add. I ordered an e-cigarette on the first of the year, so I will keep you updated! Some days I think the only way I will permanently
quit is if they put me in a coma!
Here’s the top five smoking cessation products on the market today:
- Chantix. CHANTIX is a non-nicotine prescription medicine specifically developed to help adults 18 and over quit smoking. Over 8 million people in the U.S. have already been prescribed CHANTIX. According to its website, it works by “targeting nicotine receptors in the brain, attaching to them, and blocking nicotine from reaching them.” Review: Gave me bad nightmares!
- Nicotine Replacement patches, lozenges or gum. Designed to wean your body off cigarettes, they supply you with nicotine in controlled amounts while sparing you from other chemicals found in tobacco products. They are supposed to be used on a temporary basis. Review: Good news? My husband quit smoking using the Nicotine gum. Bad news: Now he is addicted to the gum and his dentist is complaining!
- Nicotrol prescription inhaler. NICOTROL Inhaler is a mouthpiece and a
plastic cartridge that weans you slowly off cigarettes. Some say it helps with the
oral fixations as well.
- Acupuncture. Acupuncture uses ultra-slim needles in various point in
the ears and body to assist with smoking cessation. In between treatments,
small pellets are often taped to the acupuncture points on the ear. When a
cigarette craving hits, gently pressing on the pellets stimulates the acupuncture points to calm the mind and eliminate the craving.
- E-cigarettes. The latest in smoking cessation products, e-cigarettes are supposed to be safer than cigarettes. They reliably deliver a small quantity of nicotine without any of the harmful chemicals found in tobacco.
Quitting is different for everyone, so find an approach that will work for you. This may be either the cold turkey approach (stopping suddenly and totally) or a more gradual reduction in the number of cigarettes you smoke each day.
Wish me luck… I’m going to try until I succeed!"
645,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/top-6-myths-about-home-care/,"When we visit our clients for an in-home consultation, we often find there are misunderstandings about home care and what the experience entails. For many, home care is a blessing, a secure way for parents to rehabilitate in the home. Others are nervous about letting strangers into their home, because we have all heard some nightmare stories about elder care.
Here we’ll talk about some common myths about home care, versus the reality.
Myth #1: The caregivers will rob me or abuse my parents.
We have all heard news stories about the elderly being robbed or abused. However, if you look at the fine print, these cases often involve individual, unskilled caregivers of home health aides that do not come from a reputable home care agency. At FirstLight Home Care North Fulton, all of our caregivers go through a rigorous training course. They are not independent consultants – they are employees of our company. They are licensed, bonded and insured … our stellar reputation depends on it!
Myth #2: Homecare is for people who are sick or elderly.
This is wrong on both counts. Many families employ our caregivers to provide personal care or companion care for their aging parents even though they are not ill. A caregiver can come into their home, providing regular showers, meal preparation, medication reminders and more. We provide non-medical home care for those who may need a little help around the house as well. In addition, we provide disability care, post-operative care and veteran’s care to those who are 18 or older. Should your parents need regular visits by a nurse, we can coordinate all medical care as well.
FirstLight Home Care provides caregiving services on a part-time or full-time basis for short or long-term needs. If your parent needs round-the-clock care, our home care services are also available 24/7.
Myth #3: I can’t choose my caregiver.
FirstLight Home Care makes every effort to match a caregiver with an individual’s needs. We know you want someone who will connec t with your parent, spending time with similar interests and hobbies. We analyze our client’s needs and prepare a thorough care plan before sending a caregiver to a home. If at any point you are displeased with a caregiver, call us immediately and we will make a substitution. Our goal is to provide the ideal fit for your parent.
Myth #4: In home care is more expensive than assisted living.
According to Genworth’s 2015 Cost of Care survey, the national median hourly rate for home health care is $25 per hour. In contrast, the Genworth study reported that the national median cost of a one-bedroom residence in an assisted living community is $3,600 per month. There are many ways to pay for home care including reverse mortgages, VA benefits, long-term care insurance and more.
Myth #5: I’m from a big family, so there should be plenty of people to help my parents.
Move your Mom with dementia into your home and watch your family scatter! Unfortunately, it seems that caregiving responsibilities often fall on one person’s shoulders, and it’s a job that can be overwhelming, exhausting and depressing. Understand, it can be extremely rewarding as well, but it can be very difficult to make the time on top of your other daily responsibilities."
646,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/top-caregiver-skills/,"Being a family caregiver to a loved one is a very rewarding and worthwhile endeavor, but it is not always an easy task. It takes a combination of caregiver skills, including technical skills – the knowledge needed to perform specific tasks, and soft skills – the way you interact with people and solve problems.
Of the many skills a caregiver should ideally have, the following are at the top of our list…whether you are or will become a family caregiver, or if you are considering a career in the dynamic home care industry.
Communication Skills:
Communication skills are essential. Being able to articulate something as simple as a daily schedule or as complicated as discussing health concerns and observations with the person in your care, family members and healthcare providers is critical. Communication is key to ensuring that everyone involved in the caregiving relationship is provided clear and accurate information.
Physical Strength and Stamina:
Caregivers perform a variety of physical tasks, from carrying groceries to vacuuming to helping individuals with mobility. Caregivers are often on their feet for long periods of time. Having a baseline level of physical strength and stamina is important to maintaining your own health and that of your family member or client.
Problem Solving Skills:
Rarely is there a day in which everything goes exactly according to plan, and it is no different in caregiving situations. When plans change, appointments get cancelled or new routines are required based on needs, it is crucial that a caregiver can pivot and adapt to last-minute changes, as well as take on unexpected challenges. Thinking on your feet as a caregiver is important for the person in your care and for you.
Patience:
There are a lot of challenges that come with caregiving. Sometimes when we are not prepared to deal with these challenges, we lose patience. When this happens, it’s important for caregivers to take a step back and take care of themselves just as they would the person in their care. Sometimes knowing your limits and not being afraid to ask for help is one of the best ways to ensure you’re not feeling overwhelmed.
Compassion
Showing compassion means being able to tune in to another person’s distress and having the feelings and desire to alleviate it. Kindness, empathy and a caring heart are absolute “must-have” qualities for caregivers.
It takes a very special person to become a family caregiver, as well as a professional caregiver. But if you have these caregiver skills, then you might be a great fit.

We want to provide a helping hand, relieve some of the stress that comes with caregiving and give you back a few hours in your overwhelmingly busy day."
647,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/top-challenges-when-caring-for-an-elderly-family-memeber/,"A family caregiver will spend more than 24 hours a week providing care to a loved one, although many will report spending more than 40 hours per week on caregiving duties, according to the National Alliance for Caregiving study in 2019.
Family caregiving can be a genuinely rewarding experience, but it can also come with challenges. FirstLight Home Care has been serving local communities for the last 10 years and we have found that caregivers face these common top challenges when caring for elderly family members:
Financial burden. Some of the financial consequences of supporting aging parents include the need to take off work, as well as paying extra expenses like medicine, transportation and hospital costs. The cost of care can be extremely expensive because most family caregivers are unpaid. Caregivers often feel some financial strain, especially when caregiving takes them away from their paying jobs.
Physical and emotional stress. Caregiving is undoubtedly full of stressful responsibilities, and research has shown that it can lead to negative psychological and physical effects. The responsibility of caring for another person in addition to your current workload, family and personal obligations only adds to the stress. Additionally, when faced with limited support, family caregivers are often left alone to deal with the burden, causing mounting pressures. This may result in emotional and physical stress. Connecting to an organization like FirstLight®, who provides the best in-home care, senior and respite care, can offer support, peace-of-mind, and help reduce stress levels.
Feeling alone or isolated. According to Dr. Douglas Nemechek, Cigna’s chief medical officer for behavioral health, “Loneliness has the same impact on mortality as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, making it even more dangerous than obesity.”
One of the biggest challenges a family caregiver faces is the sheer “constant-ness” of their role. Caregiving has many moving parts and responsibilities – especially if there are multiple doctor appointments, pharmacy runs, meal preparation, laundry, and bathing. As the care demands increase, the amount of time a caregiver has to themselves decreases, leaving them experiencing loneliness and symptoms of clinical depression due to the lack of balance in the caregiving situation.
To combat loneliness, it’s important for the caregiver to engage with other people outside of the person in their care:
- Utilize online communities to share common experiences. Caregivers need emotional support from people who understand the situation.
- Get respite help. Schedule a couple of hours off per day as needed. Set up a lunch date with an old friend or family member to just relax and enjoy some fun.
- Join a group or take a class. If you can get away for an hour a week, you can find a social group, exercise class, art class or other hobby offered by a local organization.
- Get outdoors. The weather is getting nicer, so it’s a perfect time to get outdoors, soak in the fresh air and see other people.
- Keep a positive attitude. Sometimes, when we have been out of circulation for a while, we start to lose confidence in our ability to socialize. As a caregiver, you may feel you have nothing relevant or exciting to say, but don’t short-change yourself. Caring for a loved one is something very special and rewarding.
- Be a good friend…to yourself. Take long baths, journal, take yourself out to coffee or a movie if you can’t find someone to go with. Do things you enjoy and care for yourself in tangible ways like exercising, eating right and actively practicing self-care.
A decline in their own health from not practicing self-care. Research shows that caregiving can have a negative effect on your health if the caregiver does not carve out time for themselves. AARP reports that caregivers over the age of 50 who are experiencing mental or emotional strain have a risk of dying that is 63 percent higher than that of non-caregivers in that same age range.
Their findings state that the combination of prolonged stress, the physical demands of caregiving, and the biological vulnerabilities that come with age place caregivers at risk for significant health problems as well as an earlier death. But despite these risks, family caregivers of any age are less likely than non-caregivers to practice preventive healthcare and self-care. Family caregivers report problems attending to their own health and well-being while managing caregiving responsibilities, including:
- Sleep deprivation
- Poor eating habits
- Failure to exercise
- Failure to stay in bed when ill
- Postponement of or failure to make medical appointments for themselves
It is a balancing act to care for someone and yourself at the same time, but it is important to practice self-care and keep healthy.
Afraid to ask for help. Many caregivers feel ashamed to ask for help from others. They feel they must assume all the caregiver burden and that asking for some assistance may be a sign of weakness. Asking for help in order to make time for yourself can be a challenge, but it’s important. Caregivers need time to re-energize and take care of personal things. So don’t be afraid to ask and allow other family members and/or professional caregivers to help.

648,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/top-five-exercises-for-baby-boomers/,"If you’re over 50, you need to read this. Exercise is important but not all in one day…every day. Exercise helps promote a healthier and longer life. It improves your mood and it helps you to stay active. Benefits of exercise can also reduce the likelihood of cancer and heart disease. Here are some basic workouts for Baby Boomers.
- Cardio: Get your heart pumping every day for 30 minutes. Cardio exercises that are great for Baby Boomers include brisk walks, running, swimming and biking. We love swimming because of the low impact on our joints. We also love brisk walks because it gets us outside.
- Strength Training: As we get older, our muscles get smaller. Strength training will help change this. The other benefit of strength training is that increases muscle mass which is essential to regulate glucose metabolism – which can impact diabetes. Simple ways to add strength training to your weekly exercise plan includes pushups, resistance bands, modified squats and lunges. You don’t need a big gym. The handful of strength training ideas noted in this blog can all be done at home. A special note from Nurse Gina is to make sure you leave 24 to 48 hours between strength training because your muscles need to rest between training.
- Flexibility Training: Limited flexibility can impact balance. Regular stretching can help. Stretching in the morning and evening for 5 to 10 minutes will help you maintain, maybe even improve, your flexibility.
- Balance Training: Balance is a bit thing as we grow older. Our lack of balance will lead to falls. Daily you can do simple balance exercises that will help you maintain your balance. Some simple exercises you can do at home would be to stand next to a wall, stand on one leg, remove your hands from the wall and hold for 15 seconds and then change legs. You can also stand on your tip-toes and do the same thing. Collectively this should only take a few minutes and well worth the time.
- Core Training: Your abdominals are important to your overall health. If you avoid exercises that impact and support your abs, you could end up with a bad back. Exercises like sit ups, reverse curls and crunches will help with your core.
Exercise is a good thing. It will get you up and going every day! What’s your exercise activity you do every week? Post your weekly exercise routine on our Facebook page. Click here to post! Remember, before you start any exercise program you should consult your local physician to confirm your exercise plans and if they are right for you."
649,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/top-reasons-to-hire-a-companion-caregiver-for-your-aging-parent/,"Everyone needs companionship, and all of us need a helping hand every now and again.
If you have an elderly parent who lives alone, then chances are they could benefit from in-home companionship when family members cannot be there. At FirstLight Home Care we specialize in elderly companion care services. We provide a wide range of caregiver services to support your aging parent with daily activities, as well as personal companionship so that they can maintain their independence.
Here are some top reasons to hire a companion caregiver for your aging parent:
Company and conversation. Simply having a visitor from time to time can make all the difference in the world to someone living alone, or perhaps to someone caring for an ailing spouse. Whether it means hanging out to watch a favorite TV show together, playing a card game, or taking a walk, a companion caregiver can provide peace of mind. This may help older adults avoid loneliness and feelings of isolation. And in many cases, the caregiver and client form a strong bond and friendship.
Meal preparation. Some seniors fail to get adequate nutrition simply because they don’t want to bother with preparing a meal and cleaning up afterward. Caregivers can prepare regular meals that help elderly adults maintain a healthy diet, provide proper nutrition and add joy and comfort to a senior’s day. Plus, they also can handle the cleanup!
Medication management. Caregivers can help ensure older adults take their medications as prescribed. Understanding their medications, following the doctor’s instructions and staying on schedule, can help prevent medicine mismanagement and keep your parent healthy.
Help with daily tasks. Keeping the home tidy can be a chore for an elderly individual who has mobility issues or is temporarily bedridden. Having assistance around the house to do the dishes, take out the trash, dusting, making the bed, or doing the laundry can be a big help.
If vision or immobility is preventing your loved one from getting necessary errands done, companion care services may be an effective solution. This can include running errands, grocery shopping and taking your aging parent to the doctor’s office or to other important appointments or social events.
Family respite care. If you are the primary caregiver to your aging parent, companion care services can provide a much-needed break for the primary caregiver, whether that’s a spouse, child, other relative or friend. Allowing you to have time away to care for yourself is important. It will help to prevent you from becoming exhausted, isolated or even burned out.
We make it easy for you and your family to get started with our elderly companion care services. Your local FirstLight office will be happy to coordinate a complimentary consultation in the comfort of your loved one’s home to answer any questions you have about our care services. We’ll take the time to get to know your loved one, learn about his or her specific care needs, and outline our recommendations for care.

650,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/top-tips-for-managing-stress-during-covid-19/,"Are you feeling stressed, anxious, overwhelmed, maybe even a little scared amid the COVID-19 pandemic? If so, you are not alone. During these unprecedented times, we are all experiencing a wide range of emotions. Just know it is normal and acceptable to feel this way during a crisis.
As we care for our families and elderly loved ones in our lives, now more than ever, it’s important to take proper steps to manage stress and practice self-care.
Here are our top tips for managing and reducing your stress during Covid-19.
- As best as you can, keep your daily routine. Routines for everyone in your care are essential because they create a sense of normalcy and control in our lives. This sense of control then allows us to manage the challenges that come our way.
- If you must stay at home, maintain a healthy lifestyle – including proper diet, sleep, exercise, and keeping in contact with family and friends by phone, email, video chat or text.
- Focus on the things you can control. Don’t dwell on the things you cannot control.
- Take care of your body and find healthy ways to deal with your emotions. If you are feeling overwhelmed, talk to a sibling, a friend or a healthcare professional.
- Limit everyone’s time in front of the television, as well as computers and cell phones. Reducing the time that you and your family spend watching and listening to media coverage that you perceive as upsetting is a good thing.
- Consider ways to help others. Support your elderly neighbors by picking up groceries for them and leaving them at their door. Donate to a local charity. Support local businesses by purchasing meals or gift cards. By focusing on acts of kindness and doing good deeds for others, you can experience reduced stress and a greater sense of well-being.
- Take time each day for self-care. Self-care can include exercise, meditation, walking outside, reading, journaling, gardening, cooking a healthy meal or enjoying a favorite hobby. Pick one thing and do it at the same time each day. It will help anchor your day and provide a welcome respite.
- Be positive and encourage others. However you engage with family and friends – either by phone, text or social media – be optimistic. Your words matter and can have a positive impact on others.
Recognizing and coping with stress in a positive, healthy way can help you remain calm. Recognizing stress in others and lending support to those around us can make everyone stronger.
If you are caring for an aging loved one and you’re feeling stressed and overwhelmed, FirstLight Home Care can help. We are open and ready to serve.

651,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/top-trends-in-elderly-care-that-nurse-gina-is-watching/,"According to the US Census Bureau, by the year 2050, approximately 20.7% of the population will be 65 years or older. This is an incredible growth in the aging population of the US, especially when compared to 2000 when the population of people 65 and older was only 12.4%. As we enter an age with the highest number of retirees ever, the demand for aging care is greater than ever. Improvements in home care, health care, and technology will play a vital role in improving the lives of seniors, but with these advances arises concerns as well. A down economy and lack of financial resources have created an unclear future for those who are retiring. In order to help you get a grasp on the future of senior care, Nurse Gina has provided a brief list of the top trends she has noticed in elderly care and what it might mean for our future.
Seniors will have to rethink the longevity of their assets
Modern medical advances have allowed us to live longer, healthier lives than ever before. However, as we begin to live longer, it becomes more difficult to sustain our assets. What happens if you have a retirement plan that runs out because you outlived your assets?
As our society lives longer as a whole, we will need to rethink how we save for our futures as well as how that money is spent once we retire to ensure their longevity. For many this
may be an increase in the retirement age, or a different perspective on what retirement will embody. These assets are not just monetary, but physical assets as well. An increased life span raises the probability that physical deteriorations like dementia will set in. We must not only rethink how we manage our financial futures, but our physical futures as well, placing a greater demand on preventing and curing mentally deteriorating diseases.
Increased integration of technology
Technology has become such an integrated part of our lives that few people could imagine living a day without the internet at their finger tips. In home care, this technological
boom is becoming more evident as well. New life-saving devices are being integrated into homes throughout the country that help monitor patients and send alerts to medical professionals when needed. This technology allows for nurses to monitor the health and
medications of an individual without actually being present at the home. With this improvement in home care technology, seniors will be able to remain in their homes longer, giving them increased independence without worry of health and safety. Better yet, these devices are becoming more affordable and are beginning to play a key role in the home care industry, meaning that soon everyone will have access to these life-saving devices.
Shift from traditional nursing homes to community-based care
As home care technology improves, there will be a shift towards more community-based care alternatives that maintain seniors’ independence and quality of life. Rather than reside in a nursing home, seniors desire a more personalized approach to care that allows
them to remain in their homes and communities. Home care will continue to grow and evolve to provide personalized and engaging care tailored to each patient in the comfort of their own home. By keeping seniors involved in their community, home care will provide a greater life value without sacrificing professional and reliable care.
In order for long-term care facilities to survive, they will provide a more personalized approach to care as well. Rather than maintain all residents on similar schedules, they will begin to organize residents into smaller units based on similarities in health and mental condition. This will allow the facility to tailor meal times, activities, and personalized care to a smaller groups interests rater than standardize it throughout the entire facility, ultimately improving the quality of life and care for its residents."
652,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/tracking-devices-for-your-wandering-parent/,"A GPS tracking device for your aging parent? I know, it sounds a little strange at first… at least it did to me. I had really only heard of tracking devices being used by search and rescue teams, the police, and possibly the nervous parents of toddlers and/or new teenage drivers. But, then you throw in the additional word “wandering” before “aging parent,” and my curiosity was peaked. Maybe there are more uses and benefits than I originally thought.
So, I recently began to read up on the various tracking device options that are out in themarket. Similar to satellite navigation systems found in cars, smaller tracking devices allow its wearer’s location to be accurately pinpointed. And, it turns out that there is quite a wide array of devices in regards to size, placement, tracking abilities etc. Regarding placement, I was amazed to learn that GPS tracking devices can be found in items including watches, water-resistant bracelets and even shoes!
Therefore, they aren’t yet another “thing” that your loved one has to remember to put on/wear. If it’s in an item of clothing or an accessory that they wear every day, it will be that much more effective. I am not writing this to promote one company over another, so you won’t see specific GPS device tracking company names listed here. In alignment with FirstLight Home Care’s Culture of Care Promise, I am simply sharing some hopefully informative and helpful information to adult children with wandering parents.
GPS tracking devices have a proven track record of saving lives. When it comes to the elderly, they have been especially helpful to families of those suffering from dementia, Alzheimer’s and other forms of memory-related problems. If you have a parent or family member who shows a consistent pattern of forgetful behavior, or may struggle living an independent life, a personal monitoring GPS tracking device will make your life easier and less stressful.

Recently, the owner of FirstLight Home Care The Woodlands had the privilege of accompanying George Robinson, a 63-year-old gentleman from Houston, Texas to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico for a week’s vacation. At first, George was going to go it alone. However, his caution overtook him.
“Hiring a travel companion was the best move I ever made,” said George. “Wayne calmly took care of most things I would’ve considered impossible, especially when I take into account how much the trip drained my energy level as the week went on. The icing on the cake was how pleasant Wayne was as an individual.”
A self-proclaimed sourpuss, George said the best part of the trip was that “he made me smile, and oiled any squeaky wheel so I could enjoy the trip itself.”
What did Wayne do? We all know that traveling from state to state can be a headache, yet alone to a foreign country with different languages and currency. He arranged transportation to and from the airport, handled airport check-in, carried the luggage, tipped the appropriate people and wheeled George around the convention center. He also provided conversation and companionship at meals, something George really looked forward to. In other words, Wayne handled all the details that can make a trip disastrous for seniors or those with a disability who try and travel on their own.
“If you have parent(s) that are very independent and insist on traveling alone please ask them to reconsider, said George. “There are a myriad of problems that can arise when travelling alone. It’s like the domino theory where one problem follows the other.”
What happens if the flight gets cancelled or the plane is re-routed? If you misplace you identification? If your luggage gets lost?
“I am so thrilled I made this trip possible for George because it truly turned out to be a great experience for both of us,” says Wayne. “Even though I was on call24/7, I would do it all again tomorrow. And now George and I have each made a new friend in each other.”"

Traveling more, further and to new and exciting locations is the number one aspiration for people over the age of 50. And it’s not hard to understand why! Seniors tend to have more time on their hands, more disposable income, and the drive to discover the world having worked hard their whole lives.
Travel can also be hugely beneficial for seniors. Medical studies show that travel is great for older folks, helping with heart disease, brain function, and preventing depression and other mental issues.
Traveling with a companion is a superb way to see the world, make new friends and enjoy the well-earned leisure time that a life of dedication to a career brings. But the question remains: where to go?
These days there aren’t many barriers to traveling anywhere for older people, but some destinations and travel plans do have their advantages. Here we offer three ideas that are perfect for older travelers and their companions, to make it even easier to plan to pack your bags and explore the wide world!
Take a cruise
A cruise is a classic vacation choice for seniors and with good reason! The combination of comfort, convenience, and adventure that a trip on a cruise ship offers is absolutely perfect for older people and their traveling companions.
When it comes to destinations, the world is your oyster! Cozumel is a beautiful cruise destination, allowing you to discover the gorgeous and magical Mexican Riviera Maya as well as enjoy a Caribbean island. Alaska offers wide-open skies and stunning scenery, while cruises to Singapore, Hong Kong, or the Philippines offer the chance to discover the excitement and mystery of the Far East.
Explore national parks
America’s stunning National Parks are a great choice for adventurous seniors, offering excitement, beautiful landscapes, and wonderful wildlife everywhere you turn.
While hiking up to the summit of Half Dome in Yosemite might be a little ambitious, there are adventures to be had for all ages and physical abilities throughout the U.S. National Park system, including ranger-led hikes and amazing scenic drives.
And don’t forget, anyone over 62 can get a National Park Service Lifetime Pass for just $80, opening up the great outdoors in an entirely new way!
Get cultural in Europe
Europe’s cultural highlights should be on everyone’s bucket list, and a ‘grand tour’ of the exquisite capital cities and extraordinary sights that the Old World has to offer is a real treat.
One of the finest and most convenient ways for older people and their companions to see the best that Europe has to offer is by boat, along the network of grand rivers which crisscross the continent. Float down the Danube, the Rhine and the Rhone, and discover history, culture and the grandest of architecture on an amazing European exploration.

658,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/travel-vaccines-for-seniors/,"Many seniors are fortunate enough to enjoy traveling the world during life’s later years. With a little planning and preparation – especially when it comes to travel vaccines – they can safely visit many different destinations, in or out of the country.
Before jet-setting off to an exotic locale, it’s important that seniors do what they can to stay healthy and safe and to protect themselves from serious illnesses while traveling. Seniors should see a doctor in advance so they are aware of recommended travel vaccines and are up-to-date on routine immunizations.
If you are a family member concerned about your senior loved one who is traveling, or if you simply have questions about travel health and safety, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offer the following advice for seniors who are taking a trip:
See a doctor for a pre-travel visit. Make an appointment with your health care provider at least four to six weeks in advance of travel to discuss detailed travel plans and medical history.
- Some vaccines could be required for you to travel to certain destinations. And, because you may run the risk of encountering different diseases depending on the place you are visiting, travel vaccines will vary. For example, you may need the yellow fever vaccine if traveling to certain countries in Africa, Central America or South America.
- Tell your doctor about any illnesses you may have, as well as all medications you are taking as these may affect some of the required travel vaccines.
Seniors may want to also consider getting a physical exam to evaluate fitness level and any physical limitations. For example, if you have trouble with mobility, consider how much walking the trip will require. Those with heart conditions might choose an itinerary that does not involve strenuous activities. Seniors also tend to have a hard time recovering from jet lag and motion sickness, so take these things into account when planning your trip.
Get vaccinated.
- Before travel, seniors should be current on routine vaccines. These are the standard child and adult immunizations recommended for the general U.S. population, such as measles/mumps/rubella and seasonal flu. The diseases these vaccines protect against can be more common in other countries than in the United States, so it’s important you understand which of these routine vaccines you need.
- Your doctor may suggest additional travel vaccines depending on the countries you are visiting. These could include vaccines for hepatitis, typhoid, polio or yellow fever. Remember that some vaccines need time to start working, and some require more than one dose, so planning weeks in advance is key.
- More than 50 percent of tetanus cases are in people over the age of 65. Traveling seniors should think about getting a tetanus shot.
There are other safety tips for seniors to keep in mind, especially when traveling abroad:
- Pack enough of your regular medicine for the duration of the trip, plus a few extra days’ worth in case of travel delays. Prescription medicine should be carried in original containers. And all medications should be packed in carry-on luggage.
- Always practice safe food and water habits while in another country
- Protect yourself from bug bites as some insects can spread a number of diseases.
- Select safe modes of transportation.
- Know how and where to get medical care while traveling.
Find out how to protect yourself while traveling. Recommended vaccines are listed by country on CDC’s destination pages.

659,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/traveling-with-seniors/,"A few weeks ago my 80-plus year old parents told us “kids” that they were going to take a trip to see my mom’s sister in Seattle and that they are going to be staying with her for a few weeks. This would require a plane ride with a change of planes in Denver (unfortunately no direct flights from here), a car rental scenario, and a group of adult children worried for the safety and wellbeing of them. They are taking this trip next month, so we’ve been helping them get ready and organized to go on their vacation. This has been an eye-opening experience, but hopefully they are set for a smooth trip.
Here are some of the best tips we’ve learned on how to get your elderly parents ready to travel this summer:
Map out the Airport: They have a transfer in the Denver International Airport. This is a big airport so we have printed out a map and discussed the gate process. We have also asked for assistance (wheel chairs) to meet them at the gate.
Program their GPS: We have added in the rental company address and the address to my Aunt’s home in their GPS so that they have it set when leaving the rental company. We also made it easy for them to find their way back to return the car. We also explained the bus ride to the shuttle and what they need to do.
Medication and Notification: We discussed their medication needs and they will bring more than necessary in case of travel delays. They will bring their medication with them as a carry-on. We have also written out each medication they take and dosage and have sent it on to our cousin in the area – in case we need their assistance.
Program the Smart Phone: We added in all the key phone numbers they would need in case of an emergency. We added doctor numbers, confirmed all the “kids” numbers, and the local pharmacy that has their prescriptions.
Create a Check List: Yes, we believe this is necessary. We have created a check list of everything that they are packing that has to do with their health and wellbeing. This list includes medications, chargers, ID, phone list and we added it into one travel folder that has copies of their plane tickets, rental car agreement, pre-purchased tour bus tickets, and anything else them may need to refer to while on vacation."
660,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/uncertainty-of-the-pandemic/,"Being a caregiver is already overwhelming, even if every day is calm and peaceful. Caring for a person adds stress across nearly every aspect of life. And with the added challenges of COVID-19, that stress can blossom into difficult challenges.
However, there are means by which family caregivers can take control of the world around them. With a few simple tips, anyone can increase the dependability of their own resources. Here are three straightforward tips for caregivers looking to reduce instability due to the uncertainty of the pandemic.
Focus on Adapting and Stress Management
Managing stress during this time is essential for a happy, healthy home. With this in mind, there are several simple things anyone can do to reduce the weight of the current world.
First, it is important to stick to your daily routines. Normalcy and the familiar will allow you to feel in control. Plus, it will help those in your care continue their needed habits, such as medication or health monitoring.
Though it might be difficult, stay positive. Keep in contact with your own support system. Talk to relatives and friends more often. Or, use social media to connect with friends across the globe. Self-care is more significant now than ever, especially for caregivers who often forget their own needs in light of those they care for.
Finally, focus on your family’s mental and physical health. Now is an essential time to end unhealthy practices in the home. Switch to heart-healthy meals, and get plenty of daily exercise. This can be as simple as daily walks and noon-time aerobics. Personalize the activities to yourself and those in your care. Make use of the natural areas around you, such as nature trails and parks. Getting out reduces stress and keeps everyone happy and healthy.
Keep Your Home and Car in Top Shape
Keeping your major assets in working order is almost as important as your own health. As a caregiver, your home and car are essential pieces of caregiving equipment—both must be well-maintained. Plus, one must be prepared to adapt to the differing needs of those in your care, especially as they age or their conditions change.
First, make a list of any major items in the home that need to be maintained or repaired. Have your HVAC unit serviced? Replace old attic insulation with higher-valued spray foam. Have professionals come in to replace filters and clean your ductwork.
You might also need to upgrade your home for better accessibility. A complete home overhaul can cost around $100,000. You can start small and adapt as the family needs. For example, grab bars can cost $400 to install, but they can delay the need to replace an entire bathroom.
Prioritizing your home improvement needs will help ensure your money is being spent on the most impactful items.
Don’t forget car care. Routine maintenance and usage are crucial. Be sure to continue to follow normal tune-up schedules. Driving the car regularly will help ensure its systems stay lubricated and mobile.
If you’ve had to alter or upgrade to a chair-accessible vehicle, be sure all seatbelts are safe and functioning. Buckling up saved close to 15,000 lives in 2017 alone, and if everyone wore a seatbelt, 2,500 more lives would have been saved. Make seat belts easy to use for everyone by installing buckle guards. Additionally, seat belt reachers can help the less-mobile reach and secure their seatbelts more easily.
Keeping your home and car in top shape adds a level of stability to your life. Knowing that your major assets are functioning at top safety and efficiency not only reduces stress, it also assures you that your family is safe during these uncertain times.
Stay On Top of Your Finances
Being a family caregiver is expensive. A recent AARP study shows that families are spending close to $8,000 a year on caregiving expenses, not to mention the number of unpaid hours that being a caregiver consumes each week. And with COVID-19, unexpected expenses seem to arise every week.
Staying on top of your home’s finances is now more important than ever. It’s no longer enough to focus on reducing spending and starting a savings account. With the extra responsibilities of being a caregiver, it is beneficial to be proactive with your finances.
If possible, look into setting up investment accounts, especially if you still work and your employer has a benefits plan. Employee-matched Health Spending Accounts can accept family contributions up to $7,000 each year. And, these funds carry over. These are particularly attractive for families with routine health expenses and high deductibles.
It is also imperative to maintain strong credit. Using a secured credit card can help you quickly and safely build credit from scratch. If you’ve had credit issues in the past, secured cards can be an excellent option to rebuild. As the credit limits are set with an initial security deposit, they work great to fit your regular financial needs.
Having credit at your disposal can help cushion unexpected expenses. Surprise medical needs or household items don’t need to ruin a budget. Plus, building credit will allow for loans and mortgages with premium rates. If you know you’ll need a larger home to accommodate those in your care, then proactively building your credit can save thousands of dollars on a mortgage.
The common thread between these three tips is taking greater control. Though funds and time are often at a premium, important aspects of life must take priority. Work on upgrading your home and car for efficiency and adaptability. And don’t neglect your finances; having financial safety nets is more important than ever.
Most importantly, take time every day to focus on yourself. Find what reduces stress and incorporate it into your daily schedule. You’re a caregiver; be sure to give yourself care as well, especially during the continued uncertainty of the pandemic.

661,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/understanding-caregiver-burden-and-how-to-prevent-burnout/,"Caregiving is not a one-size-fits-all experience. Each situation has its unique pressures and specific caregiver duties. A caregiver for an adult with schizophrenia can be different than someone taking care of a loved one with multiple physical problems. The burden may be equal but the areas of life affected might be very different.
What is Caregiver Burden?
Caregiver burden is used to describe the emotional, physical and financial toll experienced by family caregivers. Think of burden as being a load, pressure, an immense duty, and/or responsibility. For some caregivers, the burden of caregiving may encompass all the stressors listed above. For others, the toll might be financial.
AARP and The National Alliance for Caregiving report that from 2015 to 2020 the number of Americans providing unpaid care increased from 43.5 million to 53 million. Women make up 61 percent, and 45 percent report an impact financially. Difficulty coordinating care has risen from 19 percent in 2015 to 26 percent in 2020. All of this adds to the caregiver’s burden.
What’s the difference between caregiver burden and caregiver burnout?
The caregiver burden can be thought of as the weight of responsibility that a person shoulders due to their caregiving activities. This burden can lead to caregiver burnout, but not always. As the responsibilities and burden of caregiving grow, however, the risk of burnout also increases.
Caregiver burnout is accompanied by symptoms of depression or anxiety, declining health, alcohol or drug use, poor sleep, inadequate nutrition, irritability and anger. It can also lead to resentment and a lack of empathy.
What Are the Common Signs of Caregiver Burden?
Recognizing the signs of caregiver burden can help you cope and manage better, potentially preventing burnout. Some signs are simply the byproducts of a lack of support and resources. Many may be familiar, but you may not think of them as burdens.
Overwhelm: Many caregivers need to provide care before they are ready. If your loved one goes into the hospital for a medical need, they may not qualify for in-patient rehabilitation. That means they will come home, and someone has to take care of them. If the person deals with cognitive impairment, the caregiver burden can be even greater. Other situations increase caregiver burden over time due to continued decline or added disability.
Being unprepared: People are discharged from hospital stays with little instruction or guidance for the caregiver. You may be expected to provide medical responsibilities, and even with support from home health services, you may not feel prepared.
If you have a loved one with both dementia and medical problems, you may have no idea how to manage memory loss, agitation, or refusing care. Much of caregiving is learned on the job, and the burden can be too much to handle.
Financial and work strain: Caregiver burden is further complicated by the financial toll it takes on families. Caregivers provide an average of 4 and a half years of care, but many provide care for much longer. Loss of full-time employment can strain already-tight budgets. Getting back into the workforce can be extremely challenging and, for some, impossible.
The AARP/National Alliance on Caregiving report says that “six in 10 caregivers report working while caregiving and the majority have experienced at least one work-related impact…When this happens, caregivers more often face financial impacts and are twice as likely to report high financial strain.”
Preventing Caregiver Burden
Caregiver resources: First, see if your loved one qualifies for any respite, adult daycare, or caregiver services through your local area agency on aging. Next, look online for free caregiver resources and caregiver training. Also, consider online forums and group chats to get ideas and emotional support.
Next, look online for free caregiver resources and caregiver training. For example, AARP, the Alzheimer’s Association, and the National Alliance for Caregiving offer education, training, and support. Also, consider online forums and group chats to get ideas and emotional support.
Counseling: Counseling for caregivers is available and can be helpful when managing emotions and solving caregiver problems. More therapists are specializing in the unique needs of family caregivers and the burdens they face. Counseling can provide a safe space to vent your frustrations and learn coping strategies to diminish the amount of strain and burden you feel.
Self-Care: Taking care of yourself is a critical piece of the puzzle and shouldn’t be neglected. Start small by taking a walk around the block or meeting a friend for coffee. Try and get the best night of sleep you can so you’ll have energy and be able to cope. Maintain a balanced diet with plenty of non-processed foods, low sugar, and fresh fruits and vegetables.
How Can You Help Someone Experiencing Caregiver Burden?
You can do a lot to help someone experiencing caregiver burden. Here are several of the best ways to help a caregiver you know.
Communicate: Caregivers may feel very alone. They might also feel like their identity has been erased. Staying in touch helps bring the outside world in and gives the caregiver an opportunity to express their feelings. By regularly communicating, you can also learn about ways to help ease the caregiver’s burden. Find out the best communication method for the caregiver, whether it be a phone call, email, Facetime, or texting.
Make specific suggestions: Rather than asking “how can I help,” offer to accomplish specific tasks such as picking up prescriptions, shopping for groceries, or spending time with the care receiver so the caregiver can take a break.
Deliver meals: Delivering meals is often a very appreciated gesture. Taking care of a meal or two means the caregiver has one less thing to worry about. Make it even easier by delivering the meals in containers that don’t need to be returned.
Offer to research: It is very time-consuming to find out about available caregiver resources. You can make calls, gather information, and keep a list of phone numbers, criteria for support, and contact information.
Caregiver burden is a real problem for many caregivers. Knowing that you are not alone may be a small consolation, but just know that this problem can be solved, and burnout prevented, by seeking support, taking care of yourself, and maintaining some balance in your life."
662,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/understanding-dementia-care-services/,"Under the best circumstances, watching a loved one age is difficult. And as time marches on, you might start to notice new and more worrisome behaviors. These can include forgetfulness, disorientation and problems communicating. When issues begin to escalate, it may be time for the next step with professional dementia care services.
What is Dementia Care?
Dementia is a general term used to describe loss of memory, language, problem-solving and other thinking abilities that interfere with an individual’s daily life. This diminishing mental capacity is not only frustrating and stressful, but might even put individuals in danger.
To keep them safe, comfortable and as independent as possible, dementia care services are designed to offer personalized support to those individuals with the condition. It can also give family caregivers a critical respite break, so they don’t get burned out or overwhelmed.
Some of the specific ways dementia care services can help your loved one include assistance with:
- Mobility support to avoid slips and falls
- Wandering prevention
- Bathing, dressing, grooming and personal hygiene
- Transportation
- Medication reminders
- Meal preparation
- Light housekeeping
In addition, beyond practical assistance, dementia care is designed to provide conversation, comfort and encouragement to your loved one through companion services. This all combines to improve an individual’s sense of well-being and overall quality of life.
Signs It’s Time to Consider Dementia Care Services
Everyone becomes more forgetful as they get older. So how can you know if the situation has escalated beyond common memory loss that comes with age? Some signs to look for include:
- Getting lost on routes they take often, like going to the store or for a walk around the neighborhood.
- Weight loss and a decline in health because they’re forgetting to eat, drink or take their medications.
- Leaving burners or appliances on after they’re finished cooking.
- Confusion and disorientation leading to accidents or falls in the home.
- A living environment that’s cluttered and dirty.
- A pet that isn’t receiving the proper attention they once did.
- Struggling with bathing, dressing and incontinence.
- Having bruises or injuries they can’t remember getting.
If these red flags sound familiar, then it’s a good time to talk to your loved one’s doctor. They may want to conduct an exam to check your loved one’s physical and cognitive health. Make sure during the visit you bring up any safety or health concerns you have.
In the meantime, if you’re interested in hiring professional dementia caregivers to ensure your loved one is in secure hands when you’re away, consider FirstLight® Home Care.

663,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/understanding-lewy-body-dementia/,"Lewy Body Dementia: Symptoms, treatment, and the challenges that come with caring for a loved one living with this disease.
Lewy body dementia (LBD) is a disease associated with abnormal deposits of a protein called alpha-synuclein in the brain. These deposits, also known as Lewy bodies, affect chemicals in the brain whose changes, in turn, can lead to problems with thinking, movement, behavior, and mood. It is the third most common cause of dementia, after Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia.
Lewy body dementia affects more than 1 million individuals in the United States. Typically, early signs of this disease begin at age 50 or older, although sometimes younger people have it. Historical data has also shown that LBD affects more men than women.
Symptoms of Lewy Body Dementia
LBD is a progressive disease with symptoms starting slowly and worsening over time. How quickly symptoms develop varies greatly from person to person, depending on overall health and age. Symptoms include changes in thinking and reasoning, confusion, visual hallucinations, delusions, trouble interpreting visual information, and memory loss that is significant but less prominent than in Alzheimer’s disease. Lewy body dementia is often misdiagnosed due to its inconsistent, fluctuating symptoms. Additionally, some indications can be very similar to Parkinson’s Disease, including certain motor symptoms, tremors, stiffness and walking or balance issues.
Treatment of Lewy Body Dementia
Research has shown that treatment of Lewy body dementia can be challenging, and there is no cure for it. Doctors instead focus treatment on the individual’s symptoms. Your doctor may prescribe medications to help with sleep, memory, and hallucinations, or to help reduce issues such as rigid muscles and slow movement. Patients with LBD can be sensitive to certain medications. There are Alzheimer’s disease medications that can improve alertness and cognition, and may help reduce hallucinations. There are also Parkinson’s medications that may help minimize symptoms such as stiff muscles and slow movement. However, these may also increase confusion, hallucinations, and delusions. Antipsychotic drugs can often worsen Lewy body dementia symptoms.
A non-drug approach for a loved one living with Lewy body dementia may be best and might include:
- Modifying their environment by reducing clutter and distracting noises to make it easier for them to function
- Speaking in a soothing tone and validating his or her concerns.
- Breaking out tasks into easier steps to help with focus, and developing daily routines to reduce confusion.
Caregivers of people with Lewy body can help by creating daily, structured routines and by keeping everyday tasks simple. Also, it’s important for caregivers to listen to their loved one, offer reassurance and avoid constantly questioning or correcting them.
Challenges Caring for Someone with Lewy Body Dementia
As Lewy body dementia advances, your loved one may require more personal assistance due to a decline in thinking and movement abilities. In the later stages of the disease, they may depend entirely on others for assistance and care. You both might need outside support that is customized to your needs and can evolve as the disease progresses.
If you are caring for a family member living with Lewy body dementia, learn how FirstLight’s Dementia Care Program can give you peace of mind and make a difference in your loved one’s care. Our Respite Care Services allow you to take some time off from your responsibilities as the primary caregiver so you can focus on yourself for a while.

664,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/understanding-medicare-and-medicare-advantage/,"Medicare is a national health insurance program in the United States, begun in 1966 under the Social Security Administration and now administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. It primarily provides health insurance for Americans aged 65 and older, but also for some people with disability status.
In 2020, Medicare will help more than 61 million people pay for everything from hospital stays to doctor visits to prescription drugs.
Then there is also Medicare Advantage, which is different than traditional Medicare. And now Medicare Advantage plans have the option of covering things that you would not normally think of when it comes to health insurance.
Understanding Medicare, Medicare Advantage and everything in between can be overwhelming, especially if you do not know where to go to get help and information. We have collected several resources to help get you started in learning more about the often-complicated health insurance programs.
A Guide to Choosing Health Coverage
AARP is a great resource for those 55 and older. AARP’s “Medicare Made Easy” guide covers a number of topics, including eligibility, costs, how to sign up, common mistakes and more, starting with “What is Medicare.”
Additionally, a recent article “The Big Choice: Original Medicare vs. Medicare Advantage”, details the differences in enrolling in federally run original Medicare and selecting a Medicare Advantage plan, the private insurance alternative.
Compare Medicare vs. Medicare Advantage
The Healthline website provides a useful resource to help you compare Traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage, explore the differences between the two, and decide which one is better for your medical needs. This article on when to sign up for Medicare provides specific information about eligibility and the time frame for signing up.
There is a wealth of valuable information on the site that is meant to help older adults and their caregivers reduce stress and make informed decisions, plus each article is medically reviewed.
Find a Medicare Advantage Plan
Medicare.gov is the official U.S. Government site. The Medicare.gov website includes the latest information on Medicare enrollment, benefits, and other helpful tools, including how Medicare Advantage Plans work and what they cover.
Medicare Advantage plans are offered by private insurance companies, and some plans are offering in-home support services for 2020. The benefit covers in-home aide for caregiver respite, home-based chores and activities of daily living (ADL) due to health issues not otherwise covered under any other Medicare benefit. These can include:
- Assistance with bathing and showering
- Assistance with dressing and grooming
- Assistance with incontinence/bathroom assistance
- Transferring or mobility assistance
- Light housekeeping
- Meal preparation
- Medication reminders
At Mediacre.gov, you can also check the health plans in your area that are offering in-home support services by visiting the Medicare Advantage plan finder which allows you to search for a plan by zip code.

665,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/understanding-oral-cancer-risk-factors-early-detection-and-prevention/,"April is Oral Cancer Awareness Month.
According to the Oral Cancer Foundation, close to 53,000 Americans will be diagnosed with oral or oropharyngeal cancer this year. However, if it is caught early enough, the chances of successful treatment are high.
At your regular dental checkup, your dentist should look for early signs of mouth cancer, but it’s also important for you to take an active role in recognizing the signs as well.
Risk Factors
There is no single leading cause of oral cancer, but there are various factors that could put someone at a higher risk for this disease:
- Age: The disease usually occurs over the age of 40; most people who are diagnosed are 55 and older
- Gender: Men are twice as likely to develop oral cancers
- Lifestyle: Tobacco use, including smokeless tobacco, and heavy alcohol use can put someone at higher risk
- Family or personal history: Those who have had oral cancer previously are at an increased risk of developing another oral cancer
- Excessive sun exposure
- Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection
Early Detection
Early detection is key to surviving oral cancer. It can go unnoticed because early signs of oral cancer are typically painless. Unfortunately, low-risk patients are not diagnosed until they are already suffering from chronic pain or loss of function.
Signs and symptoms may include:
- White or red patches inside the mouth or on the lips
- Swelling, lumps, bumps, rough spots or eroded areas on the lips or inside the mouth
- Unexplained bleeding in the mouth
- Unexplained numbness or loss of feeling in the mouth, face or neck
- Persistent sores in the mouth that do not heal within 14 days
- Difficulty chewing, swallowing, speaking or moving the jaw or tongue
Prevention
There is no guaranteed way to prevent oral cancer, but there are things you can do to lower your risk of getting it.
- Brush, floss, and rinse. Brushing twice a day for 2 minutes, flossing once, and rinsing your mouth after each meal is recommended.
- Avoid – and more importantly – do not start smoking or chewing tobacco.
- Drink alcohol in moderation.
- Eat more cancer-fighting foods. A diet rich in fruits and vegetables, as well as a healthy intake of Vitamin C and calcium, reduces the risk of cancer. Try incorporating as many “cancer-fighting” foods into your diet as you can – kale, broccoli, blueberries, sweet potatoes, turmeric, yogurt, sunflower seeds, coconut oil, mushrooms, and green tea.
- Use a lip balm with SPF 15 or higher and apply throughout the day.
- Check your mouth regularly for early signs and make an appointment with your dentist or doctor if you notice any changes.
- Discuss concerns with your dentists at your next regular dental checkup.

666,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/understanding-our-services-alzheimers-care/,"Alzheimer’s can be one of the most difficult diagnoses to face. There’s so much uncertainty about your loved one’s future and what kind of care and support they will need. At FirstLight Home Care, we offer Alzheimer’s care designed specifically for this condition. It can help in a range of ways, ensuring your loved one is happy, safe, comfortable, and still enjoying life.
Our Alzheimer’s Care Begins by Getting to Know Your Loved One
Just because your loved one is living with Alzheimer’s doesn’t mean they are a different person. It’s why we always build our services around the individual, so we can ensure we’re caring for them in a personalized way.
At FirstLight Home Care, we provide a “Who I Am” Booklet, so that we can document critical details about your loved one. We want to know more than just if they need help with meal preparation and transportation. We want to know if they like jokes, play cards, listen to music or watch old black and white movies.
What makes your loved one happy, sad or joyful? We aim to answer these and other questions as well so that we can learn about all the intangibles that make your loved one who they are. This enables us to provide the best Alzheimer’s care and help your loved one feel more comfortable and at home in our caring hands.
Based on this information, our coordinators will build the right Alzheimer’s care plan. It also helps us match your loved one with caregivers who will be the best fit for them, taking into consideration their personality and interests. We’ll even involve your family in this process to ensure you can meet with our caregivers, ask questions, and get to know them.
Throughout the time we’re delivering care, we will also regularly seek feedback and stay in contact with your family. This helps us to identify any new issues and always maintain the right level of care. Down the line, if needed, we can always adjust and modify the Alzheimer’s care we’re providing as your loved one’s condition changes.
How Our Alzheimer’s Care Can Help
At FirstLight Home Care, our caregivers are available for your loved one with Alzheimer’s during the day, overnight and even 24/7. They can provide the assistance and support your loved one needs to live a life of dignity, with as much independence as possible. This includes:
- Personal care services, such as help with mobility and while bathing, dressing and grooming, as well as with eating and personal hygiene.
- Companion services to offer conversation and comfort, supervision to avoid getting lost and transportation to recreational activities and for social outings.
- Brain health services provided by memory care practitioners to help your loved one improve or maintain their brain health and minimize cognitive decline.
- Help around the house, including meal planning and preparation, grocery shopping, light housekeeping, laundry and in other areas as well.
We can also provide family caregivers like you with a respite break to ensure you’re getting the time and freedom you need to maintain your own health and well-being. This is particularly important when a loved one has Alzheimer’s.
Providing Care at Home or in an Assisted Living Community
Sometimes an assisted living community is the right place for someone with Alzheimer’s. However, in many cases, with just some extra help, an individual can remain safe and happy right at home, especially in the early stages of the disease.
At FirstLight Home Care, we help make that happen, so your loved one will be able to age in place for as long as possible in familiar surroundings. This is important for someone with Alzheimer’s. They’re entire world has suddenly changed and is filled with uncertainty. Remaining in the place where they feel most comfortable can make a big difference in their overall health and well-being.
If, however, they’re not able to live at home safely, our team can still provide Alzheimer’s care wherever they are, whether it’s a nursing home or assisted living community or even in a hospice setting.
We can offer companion care, providing a caregiver who can sit and chat, play cards and games, take them out to their favorite restaurant and ensure their emotional and social needs are met in other ways important to them. We can also provide transportation to and from appointments, as well as help running errands, so your loved one is able to maintain a good quality of life.
Whatever their condition and needs, we are here to help with non-medical Alzheimer’s care. In everything we do, we will treat your loved one with dignity and respect. They’ll continue to enjoy life and remain independent for as long as possible.
Do you have a loved one who requires professional Alzheimer’s care? Contact your local FirstLight Home Care today. We offer specialized services, along with compassionate caregivers who will make life easier and more joyful."
667,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/understanding-our-services-companion-care/,"Loneliness and social isolation among the elderly were serious public health issues even before the COVID-19 outbreak. In fact, in a 2020 study released by the National Institutes of Health, 24% of adults over the age of 65 were considered socially isolated. Today, that number is far higher due to the pandemic, which is where companion care services can help.
What is Companion Care?
The need for social and emotional support doesn’t diminish as individuals age. It’s just as important for those who are elderly – and even those who have special needs – to be social; however, it’s harder to achieve this due to challenges ranging from mobility and fatigue to a lack of transportation.
Yet, when individuals are isolated for too long, studies show a dramatic increase in health complications. Loneliness and isolation can lead to issues including dementia, stroke and heart disease, as well as higher rates of depression, anxiety and suicide. There’s also an increase in hospitalization and visits to emergency departments for those who are socially isolated.
Companion care services can be a lifeline for these seniors and disabled adults, providing them with the necessary and healthy social interaction they need to maintain their overall sense of well-being. It can include anything from sharing meals and playing games to simply sitting and chatting. Companion care can also provide practical support, such as help around the house, transportation and assistance running errands.
How Our Companion Care Services Can Help
Whether your loved one is in their own home, living with you or in a senior living community, FirstLight® Home Care’s professional caregivers can provide the right level of companion care. We’ll work with you and your family to personalize a schedule that’s a fit for your loved one, whether it’s on a part-time or full-time basis. We can even provide live-in services on a temporary or more permanent basis, if needed. Some of our companion care services include:
Offering Comfort & Conversation
Just the opportunity to have a friend and confidant to talk with can make a world of difference for your loved one, especially if they’re living alone. This gives them something to look forward to and it provides the social and emotional support they need. With companion care, we can even play games, cards, bingo or participate in other recreational activities your loved one enjoys.
Preparing Healthy Meals
A healthy diet is critical to your loved one’s overall well-being. If they’re having trouble keeping up with cooking and eating nutritious meals, our caregivers can help. We’ll prepare regular, healthy meals for them and can even handle all the clean-up afterward.
Helping with Light Housekeeping Chores
If your loved one doesn’t have the energy or mobility to maintain their household, our companion caregivers can provide assistance. This includes tidying rooms, removing trash, lightly cleaning kitchens and bathrooms, vacuuming and more. We can also wash, dry and fold clothing, including towels and bed linens. Their home will feel fresher, cleaner and be more comfortable.
Offering Medication Reminders
Many individuals become forgetful as they age. However, when taking important medications for issues like high blood pressure or dementia, this can put their safety and health at risk. Our caregivers can remind your loved one to take their medications, and we’ll notify you if we see any new side effects or concerns regarding your loved one’s medication.
Providing Transportation
If your family member can no longer drive, it can be difficult to get to appointments or run errands. Our companion caregivers can help by driving them to appointments, to get groceries, or pick up prescriptions or dry cleaning.
Organizing Paperwork & Bills
We’ll make sure your loved one’s mail and paperwork are organized. We’ll keep track of bills and other important messages, as well as maintain an efficient system for paperwork. We can also help your loved one open and read mail if they have issues with their vision or difficulty opening envelopes.
When an individual is struggling to live independently, it can put stress on you. It’s why – in addition to companion care services – we also offer respite breaks. These will give you and other family caregivers some much-needed space and freedom, whether it’s to spend time at home, manage work obligations, go on vacation or simply go out to dinner. We know caregiving is a challenging role, and we’re here to help you get the time off you need.
If you’re interested in companion care for your loved one, contact your local FirstLight Home Care today. We can provide comfort, support and help through our compassionate caregivers."

If you are a family caregiver, it’s up to you to provide comfort and disability care in a range of ways, from housekeeping help and assistance with bathing and dressing to running errands and transportation. Not only is this a serious commitment, but a long-term one as well.
Whether they were born with a disability or became disabled through an injury or medical condition, FirstLight® Home Care can support you and your loved one with our disability care services.

Ways We can Help with Our Disability Care Services
At FirstLight Home Care, our disability care services are always customized, so we’re meeting your loved one’s needs in the way that works best for them. It’s why our process starts first with a conversation. We want to learn about them, their lifestyle, preferences and daily needs.
We’ll also ask questions and address concerns, so together we can create a personalized plan for disability care services. Your loved one will enjoy a much higher quality of life with the right blend of professional services in the place they call home. Some of these include:
Personal & Companion Care
Our goal is to help your loved one live with more joy and independence through a range of personal and companion care services.

Travel Assistance
Do you need to travel with a loved one who has a disability? FirstLight Home Care can help you navigate the journey so it’s easier and less stressful. Under the best circumstances, traveling can be challenging. However, for a disabled individual, it can be especially daunting. With one of our caregivers, we can ensure your loved one stays safe, has their needs met and feels comfortable and secure during the entire experience.
With our disability care services, we can also help in areas such as with airport check-in and ticketing, carrying luggage, providing assistance through security, and support with personal hygiene, meals and more during the trip. You’ll both have a better time when you can simply relax and enjoy, knowing you have the extra hands you need.
Respite Care
You love your family member unconditionally. However, sometimes you need a break. Whether it’s to manage your own personal obligations, like family and work, or for a short-term period of time if you’re away, FirstLight Home Care can provide respite care.
This type of care allows you to take the time off that’s needed to tend to your own life. It also ensures you’re getting the mental and emotional break that helps you maintain your personal health.
When your needs go ignored for too long or you’re exhausted from juggling so many demands, it can lead to physical ailments, along with resentment and frustration. Over time, this can even fracture the relationship you have with your loved one. However, when you’re happy and balanced, you and your loved one can both enjoy time together without stress and pressure. It’s why a respite break – and taking care of your own needs – is so important.
Advantages of Our Disability Care Services
Whether you have a younger relative or older family member who’s disabled, they’re faced with many challenges. However, that doesn’t mean they have to feel helpless.
In fact with disability care from FirstLight Home Care, we’ll empower them so they feel safer, confident and more independent. They can focus on enjoying life to the fullest without being hindered by their disability. They’ll also have the comfort and peace of mind knowing a caregiver is there to help whenever they need it.
In addition, we can provide the kind of disability care that helps them stay where they’re happiest – in their own home – and navigate the space with ease. According to Disabled World, seven in 10 adults with disabilities live with their parents or guardian and 17% live independently. Wherever your loved one calls home, we’ll work to ensure the environment is safe for them, providing more security and freedom.

671,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/understanding-parkinsons-disease-and-providing-in-home-care/,"In the U.S. alone, nearly one million people are living with Parkinson’s disease, with 60,000 new cases diagnosed every year. There are more people with Parkinson’s than multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and Lou Gehrig’s disease combined.
Yet, it can be a condition that is difficult to diagnose and hard to spot until serious damage has already occurred. If you’re concerned about a loved one who’s showing potential signs of Parkinson’s, what should you do? Here’s everything you need to know to provide Parkinson’s care.
Early Signs of Parkinson’s Disease
Tremors are one of the most widely recognized signs of Parkinson’s disease. However, up to 30% of patients don’t experience them at the onset of the disease. They come later when the condition has progressed. This progression is different for each individual and can include symptoms such as:
- Small handwriting. Individuals with Parkinson’s disease often experience a condition called “micrographia.” This disorder features abnormally small, cramped handwriting or a quick progression to small handwriting. It is caused by neurodegenerative disorders of the basal ganglia, including Parkinson’s.
- Loss of smell. With the COVID-19 pandemic, loss of smell and taste have been top-of-mind. However, did you know loss of smell could also be an early warning sign of Parkinson’s disease? This reduced or lost sense is called “hyposmia” and is often associated with the condition.
- A hard time sleeping. Everyone has problems sleeping at one time or another. However, if a loved one is suddenly thrashing around in their sleep or acting out dreams, it could be an indicator of Parkinson’s.
- A low or soft voice. If your loved one has a sudden change in their tone of voice or it sounds hoarse, you should talk to a doctor about Parkinson’s disease. This problem occurs because the tremors, stiffness and slow movement that occur in the rest of the body can also impact the muscles used for speaking and swallowing.
- Problems with mobility. As people age, they often have issues walking or getting in or out of a bed or chair. However, if you notice your loved one isn’t swinging their arms when walking or they seem unusually stiff, particularly in the shoulders or hips, it can be a red flag. Those with Parkinson’s report feeling like movement doesn’t come naturally any longer and like their feet “feel stuck” to the floor.
- Stooping or hunching. Age, injury and disease can all impact an individual’s posture over time. However, if your loved one is suddenly not standing up straight or only feels comfortable stooping or slouching, it could be a symptom of Parkinson’s disease. This is because the condition impacts the brain’s control of automatic activities, including reminders to stand up straight.
- Dizziness or fainting. Feeling dizzy when standing up or getting out of bed can be a warning sign of low blood pressure that is linked to Parkinson’s. This happens because the condition limits the release of norepinephrine, a chemical that constricts blood vessels and raises blood pressure.
- Facial masking. If your loved one’s facial expression is mad, sad or angry, without them realizing it, they’re displaying something called “facial masking.” This can make it hard for you to interpret their mood and intentions. It’s caused by stiffness in the facial muscles, making it more difficult to smile or express emotions.
Questions to Ask a Doctor About Parkinson’s Disease
None of the signs above on their own are a cause to worry. However, if you’re noticing several at once, it’s time to call their doctor and have them evaluated. Unfortunately, there isn’t a single test or one way to diagnose the condition. Instead, by assessing certain symptoms and conducting a range of diagnostic tests, your loved one’s doctor will be able to make an accurate diagnosis. This is important, especially in the early stages.
If your loved one is diagnosed, stay positive. They can still live a full life and many people do with minimal symptoms. You’ll just need to work with their healthcare provider to find the right mix of medications and complementary therapies that can ensure a good quality of life.
Some additional questions to ask your loved one’s care provider include:
- What are the options for treatments? What are the pros and cons of each? What do you recommend?
- What are the side effects of medications? Can anything minimize those side effects?
- Are there any clinical trials to participate in?
- What lifestyle modifications can be made to help, including diet, in-home care services, supplements and exercise?
- Is there anything my loved one should avoid in terms of over-the-counter drugs, supplements or food?
- Are there support groups for those with Parkinson’s disease and their families?
How to Care for Your Loved One with Parkinson’s Disease
There are many ways you can help your loved one with Parkinson’s disease. The first includes ensuring they have access to the right team of medical professionals. This can include a mix of nutritionists, internists, physical therapists, movement disorder specialists and even in-home caregivers. While there is no one standard treatment, your loved one’s care team will create a personalized protocol.
Some ways you can support the process include:
Offer Medication Reminders
Keeping track of medications is crucial, but it can be a challenging task. The best approach is a strict one with a schedule and pill organizers that ensure doses are not missed.
Help with Exercise
Exercise can help your loved one maintain mobility, improve balance and motor coordination, and boost their mood. At the same time, you’ll want to build up your own strength since caring for someone with Parkinson’s is physically demanding.
Make Personal Care Easier
Personal home care can become difficult over time as your loved one’s condition progresses. Implement some lifestyle modifications that make it easier to bathe and dress. These can include a shower chair and hand-held shower head, sponges with soap inside, a non-skid rug and towels with straps that are easier to hold onto.
Focus on Proper Nutrition
Both you and your loved one must follow a proper diet to maintain health and strength. There is no one diet that is recommended for those with Parkinson’s disease. However, generally a balanced diet with a mix of fruits, vegetables and lean meats will promote good health. If your loved one has problems with swallowing or constipation from their medications, then you might need to make some changes to their diet to accommodate for these issues.
Take Respite Breaks
Caring for a loved one with Parkinson’s disease is a heavy load. Make sure you’re taking plenty of respite breaks to get much-needed time to yourself. You can ask family caregivers and friends to step in when you’re away. You can also hire in-home caregivers to provide help and support to your loved one, as needed. These are professionals who will help your family member stay safe and comfortable, giving you peace of mind.
If you would like professional in-home care for your loved one, contact your local FirstLight Home Care today. We can create a personalized plan that ensures they get the support and encouragement they need."
672,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/understanding-sleep-apnea-and-alzheimers-disease/,"June is Alzheimer’s & Brain Awareness Month
Did you know that people who have sleep apnea in mid-life are more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease as they get older? If you have a loved one with Alzheimer’s, you’re probably aware that there is a connection. However, you might not understand why.
With Alzheimer’s Awareness & Brain Awareness Month in June, it’s a good time to discuss this common issue, why it occurs, and ways caregivers can help.
The Link Between Sleep Apnea and Alzheimer’s Disease
Medical experts have known for a long time that there is a strong connection between Alzheimer’s and one specific type of sleep apnea called obstructive sleep apnea. This is the most diagnosed of the three types, and it occurs when the throat muscles relax and are unable to hold the airways open.
In the past, research has shown that sleep apnea impacts the brain, causing damage that can potentially lead to cognitive impairment. Specifically, it triggers atrophy in the brain’s hippocampus, the area critical for memory. Now, new research has made even more progress in uncovering the connection between sleep apnea and Alzheimer’s.
In the Alzheimer’s brain, abnormal levels of a naturally occurring protein – called beta-amyloid 42 – clump together to form plaques. These collect and build up between nerve cells and disrupt their function.
In a new study published in the medical journal, Sleep, researchers found that the more severe a person’s obstructive sleep apnea, the more likely they are to have increased amounts of these plaques in the hippocampus. This is because sleep deficiency hinders the brain’s ability to clear out the protein.
In addition, the research also found that episodes of oxygen deprivation followed by re-oxygenation – the hallmark of sleep apnea – may lead to stress that further injures the hippocampus and nearby areas of the brain. This makes the brain more susceptible to Alzheimer’s disease.
Other research has also linked obstructive sleep apnea to a range of different cognitive impairments. These can include damage to memories and decision making, as well as the ability to learn new information.
How to Help a Loved One with Sleep Apnea and Alzheimer’s Disease
As researchers continue to work to better understand the connection between sleep apnea and Alzheimer’s, there are steps you can take now to support your loved one with both conditions. First, it’s critical they get medical care to treat sleep apnea, so they can improve the quality of their nighttime rest and lower their risk for additional cognitive damage. If you’re a primary family caregiver of someone with Alzheimer’s disease and sleep apnea, make sure you’re also focusing on:
- Maintaining a Healthy Lifestyle. Obesity and even being overweight can make sleep apnea worse. It’s why losing weight through a healthy diet and exercise plan is so important. In fact, this step alone can significantly reduce the number of sleep apnea episodes that occur each night. In addition, both smoking and consuming alcohol can escalate symptoms of sleep apnea. Alcohol even impacts how the brain works. Therefore, it’s best to quit smoking and limit drinking or avoid it altogether.
- Adhering Closely to a Routine. As their condition progresses, your loved one may become increasingly frustrated with their loss of mental and physical abilities. However, when they know what to expect each day through a routine, they will feel more calm and secure. In fact, those with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia thrive on familiarity and routine and experience less agitation with a regular schedule in place.
- Keeping the Home Safe. Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease can experience balance loss and diminished motor skills depending on the stage of their disease. It’s why evaluating their home for safety hazards is important. Monitor the areas where your loved one spends the most time. Make sure you’re getting rid of loose area rugs, fixing broken steps and installing grab bars in key spots.
- Anticipating their Needs. There will be times when a loved one becomes agitated and it’s hard to understand why. This can be especially difficult if they’re struggling with sleep apnea and the resulting sleep deprivation. Try to be patient and ask questions – such as if they are tired or hungry – that help them articulate their specific needs.
- Investing in an Alert System. If your loved one is alone at times and you’re fearful about their safety – especially at night – invest in a home alert system. This will allow them to press a button and get the help they need from a 24/7 monitoring center. If your loved one can’t speak, a first responder will be sent to their home and a list of key contacts will then be called.
- Getting Respite Help. It’s just as important for you to take care of yourself as it is to meet your loved one’s needs. Respite care can be invaluable, providing access to experienced and compassionate caregivers to step in and help when needed. Whether it’s through regular weekly breaks or while you’re away on vacation, finding someone you can trust will improve your well-being and quality of life.

If you’ve met one person with Alzheimer’s disease, you’ve only met one person. Everyone with Alzheimer’s experiences the disease differently. However, patients with the illness tend to follow a similar path from the beginning of the disease to its end. The key is understanding the progression and stages of Alzheimer’s disease.
According to the Alzheimer’s Association, the disease typically progresses slowly in three general stages:
- Mild (early-stage)
- Moderate (middle-stage)
- Severe (late-stage)
One thing is certain: the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease get worse over time. But because Alzheimer’s affects people in different ways, each person will progress through the stages differently. Although the three stages of Alzheimer’s disease are just a guide, you can be better prepared and plan for what’s to come by understanding what to expect from each stage.
The Alzheimer’s Association has a great guide on the overall progression of the disease, as well as details on each stage. You can read more about the stages of Alzheimer’s Disease.

675,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/vaccines-for-older-adults/,"August is National Immunization Awareness Month, an annual observance to bring awareness to the importance of vaccines for people of all ages.
Immunization Awareness Month was established to encourage people – young and old – to make sure they are up to date on the various vaccines recommended for them.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises that all adults need immunizations to keep them from getting and spreading serious diseases that could result in poor health, missed work and not being able to care for family or themselves.
Older adults may need one or more vaccines, even if they received them as a child or as a younger adult. Immunity to some diseases can wear off over time, and as people age, they are at an increased risk of contracting various illnesses.
All adults need:
- A seasonal flu vaccine every year. The flu vaccine is specifically important for people with chronic health conditions, pregnant women, and older adults. The CDC estimates that since 2010, flu-related hospitalizations in the United States have ranged from 140,000 to 710,000 and flu-related deaths have ranged from 12,000 to 56,000.
- The Tdap vaccine once if they did not receive it as an adolescent. This protects against pertussis (whooping cough). Adults also should get a Td (tetanus, diphtheria) booster shot every 10 years.
Adults 50 years and older should also get:
- The shingles vaccine, which protects against shingles and the complications from the disease. This is recommended for healthy adults 50 years and older
- Pneumococcal vaccines, which protect against pneumococcal disease, including infections in the lungs and bloodstream. This is recommended for all adults over 65 years old, and for adults younger than 65 who have certain chronic health conditions. About 900,000 people get pneumococcal pneumonia every year, leading to as many as 400,000 hospitalizations and 19,000 deaths.
Talk with your senior loved one’s doctor or other healthcare professional to know which vaccines are recommended for them. And check out this immunization schedule by age and by health condition as a guide.

676,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/veteran-care/,"FirstLight Home Care team members are proud to be able to serve and care for our men and women Veterans. We work hard to deliver care that is tailored to the servicemen and women that have fought for our freedom. We provide services that can be covered through a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) pension program that provides financial benefits to veterans, or their surviving spouses, with non-service connected disabilities (called “Aid and Attendance). FirstLight Home Care caregivers can come into your home or a home of a Veteran family member and create a safe and supportive environment for you by providing vital personal care or companion care services.
In fact, Aid & Attendance can help pay for care in the home, a Nursing Home or an Assisted Living facility. A veteran can be eligible for up to $1,758/month and a surviving spouse can be eligible for up to $1,130/month. Our caregivers can help with:
- Transportation to doctors and physical therapy appointments.
- Support in-home care and mobility around the home.
- Companion care services including personal care, meal preparation, light housekeeping and laundry services.
- Shopping, errands and recreational activities.
We have years of experience working through the governments red tape to apply for benefits and at FirstLight Home Care, we can help you with the paperwork. Some of the benefits of working with us include:
- We prescreen clients for Aid & Attendance eligibility.
- If you are eligible, we complete the VA benefit application and assist in the collection and processing of government and medical documents.
- Once approved, we’ll continue to advocate and assist in maintaining eligibility.
- Rather than waiting the 8 to 12 months for the first government check to arrive, we make the VA pension funds available right away. Please speak to a local FirstLight Home Care for additional details and their specific process for working with you and the VA.
At FirstLight Home Care, we consider it a privilege to recognize the sacrifices veterans have made and are honored to have an opportunity to make a difference in their lives and the lives of their loved ones. Our home caregivers can assist in eating, bathing, dressing, undressing, medication dosing, taking care of the needs of nature and more. Don’t struggle … we can provide you with exceptional care and you never have to leave the comfort of your home!"
677,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/veterans-day-and-corduroy-lovers/,"I read a peculiar story on The Wall Street Journal’s website this morning. Apparently, today is not only a day of honor and remembrance for the 24.9 million military veterans in the U.S., but it’s also a big day for corduroy lovers. Yes, the material. The ribbed textile lovers make up the 5,000 members of the Corduroy Appreciation Club and for them, no day gets better than today—11.11.11—which clearly symbolizes the vertical lines of the beloved fabric.
If corduroy isn’t your thing, you can still honor our nation’s veterans and active duty service members, for the protection they provide is something that greatly affects us all. In many instances, elderly veterans don’t get the respect and the assistance they’ve earned through their service. Veterans Day presents a great opportunity to educate young people about the sacrifices made by their fathers and grandfathers, uncles, neighbors, and mothers and grandmothers. There are plenty of ways to get involved and lend a helping hand to the many veterans who need it. MilServe.org is a useful site to find volunteer opportunities to help service members, veterans and their families."
678,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/ways-to-boost-brain-health/,"Brain health is the ability to remember, learn, play and maintain an active mind. According to the American Heart Association, failing brain health is a public health epidemic that could be more serious than we think.
Consider these statistics:
- The brain begins showing signs of cognitive decline as a person enters their 20s.
- 3 out of 5 Americans will develop a brain disease in their lifetime.
- By 2030, the total cost of Alzheimer’s, dementia, and stroke is expected to exceed $1 trillion.
The good news is, we can develop and change our brains no matter how old we are!
It’s never too early to start doing what we can to boost brain health. Cognitive decline begins well before we ever see symptoms of it. Every 65 seconds, someone in the United States develops Alzheimer’s disease. The Alzheimer’s Association projects that by 2050 there will be nearly 14 million Americans living with the disease.
As we age, we must take advantage of the strengths of our brain while reducing some of the risks to it. Here are some everyday ways to maintain a healthier brain:
Be a kid again…every day
When is the last time you put everything aside to just have fun? As adults, we tend to focus so much on work and other responsibilities that we don’t make a conscious effort to do something that gives us pure enjoyment.
According to Denise Medved, creator of Ageless Grace, physically “playing” for just 10 minutes a day can have a positive effect on long-term brain function. As children, we developed functional and cognitive skills through childhood games, sports and other activities, skills that most no longer practice as adults.
Ageless Grace is a brain fitness program that works by re-opening the neural pathways that were created from the time we were born until about the age of 21. The exercises not only help re-open those pathways, but they also help create new ones. The program’s tools stimulate and utilize the five functions of the brain – analytical, strategic, kinesthetic learning, memory/recall and creativity and imagination. The movements are fun and easy to do and include activities like pretending to swim, play baseball or play a musical instrument.
Maintain an active mind
Activities that are new and complex are good brain exercises. So, do something every day that challenges your brain.
- Try something you’ve never done before that you also find challenging. Take up a new sport or hobby. Learn a new language. Learn to play a musical instrument. Try juggling.
- Do something you already know how to do but do it in a different way – like eating, combing your hair or brushing your teeth with your non-dominant hand. Or simply change up your daily routine once in a while.
- Try a daily memory activity. Test your recall by memorizing a grocery list. Draw a map from memory. Do math in your head.
When you attempt to do a task you are not used to doing, you create new neural pathways. The more neural pathways you have, the more resilient your brain is. Neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to reorganize and rebuild itself by forming new neural connections. Studies have shown that learning to perform new and challenging activities can engage the brain’s natural plasticity to make positive changes. Even the adult brain can be reorganized depending on what new information it is learning.
Keep a gratitude journal
Practicing gratitude can reduce stress, improve mental well-being and help us feel happier and more appreciative. There is no scientific evidence that practicing gratitude improves your physical health. But taking just five minutes each day to write down what you are grateful for can go a long way to improving your emotional health. Set aside a few minutes every morning as soon as you wake up and a few minutes each night before you turn in to record your gratitude.
Reduce your risks to potential health issues
What’s good for the heart is good for the brain. Cardiovascular disease, Type 2 Diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol, as well as smoking, poor eating and physical inactivity are all key risk factors for cognitive impairment and dementia. There are steps you can take to help control and reduce these risks. Be sure to get your annual check-ups, follow the recommendations and care plans of your health care professionals, and take your medications as prescribed.
As we age, we must take advantage of the strengths of our brain while reducing some of the risks to it. The earlier we begin taking steps to boost our brain health, the better chance we have of preventing cognitive decline.
At FirstLight® Home Care, our goal is to improve overall health and well-being and enhance quality of life, especially for those with cognitive deficits related to Alzheimer’s disease, dementia and traumatic brain injury. Learn more about our Brain Health Services.

679,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/ways-to-help-elderly-adults-stay-happy-at-home/,"As the pandemic’s end remains uncertain, most senior citizens are being forced to stay at home and limit contact with others to protect their health and safety. While it is certainly in the best interest of their physical wellness, feeling locked indoors and away from their routine can significantly impact a senior’s mental and emotional health. Here are some tips to help elderly adults stay happy at home.
Maintain a routine
One of the most difficult aspects of having to stay indoors for many seniors is the change in routine and structure. Help them create a routine in their new normal to feel some sense of comfort and organization.
Help them schedule out their mealtimes, encourage them to stick to a strict bedtime and wake-up time, and plan a regular amount of time dedicated daily to exercise or a hobby. This will help them feel some sense of normalcy and purpose every day and will help them better adjust to and avoid the stressors of staying inside.
Create a comfortable environment
If your loved one will be spending most of their day inside their home, it’s important that they’re in a comfortable environment where they are able to relax.
You can safely furnish their home with new essentials from online retailers that will be delivered contactless to your door. You can purchase everything from cozy throw pillows to new sofas and couches online to help them get comfortable in their living space and feel refreshed without having to worry about the risks of shopping in-person.
You can also consider hanging photos of family and friends, as well as artwork from grandchildren to help give them a sense of community in their surroundings. While your time with each other may be limited, the more you can keep them connected and involved with what’s going on, the better off they will be! Putting in the extra effort to help them build a cozy home can make it easier for them to adjust to staying indoors. It can also show your love for them and attention to their needs.
Find satisfying alternatives to regular activities
While they may not be able to attend their normal social events or do certain activities that they typically enjoy, it’s important that seniors are still able to spend their time doing something that brings them joy. And, if you get creative, there are likely plenty of options available to do so!
You can help them find upcoming live streams of academic lectures, musical acts, or author talks, or create a list of safe outdoor activities for them, such as walking, gardening and cycling. Having an event or activity to look forward to can bring great joy to older adults when they cannot attend their regular interests.
Schedule time with loved ones
Likely the most difficult aspect of the pandemic for seniors has been the inability to spend time with their loved ones due to health risks. However, physical distancing doesn’t need to mean losing contact with others.
If your loved one is unable to see family and friends face-to-face, or even through a window, you can help them set up a Zoom account so they can meet with loved ones virtually. Or, if they are uncomfortable using an online video service, you could plan a group phone call. Being able to maintain some emotional bonds with loved ones will help seniors adjust to this new normal faster and continue to feel connected socially.
Caring for an elderly loved one during the COVID-19 pandemic is certainly not an easy task; it can be frightening and emotionally exhausting. But anything you do to make their time at home more comfortable and enjoyable will help alleviate some of the stress and frustration they may be feeling.
If you do not have family support to help you, we can. Learn more about FirstLight Home Care’s Respite Care services."
680,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/ways-to-improve-mental-health-in-older-adults/,"Mental health consists of emotional, psychological and social well-being. It impacts the way we think, feel, act and relate to others. Positive mental health is essential to overall health and quality of life.
The American Association of Geriatric Psychiatry estimates that 20% of people aged 55 years and older experience some type of mental health concern. The most common mental health problems in older adults include anxiety, severe cognitive impairment and mood disorders, such as depression.
There are many ways to help improve mental health in older adults.
Incorporate regular movement and exercise. Making time for exercise or some type of physical movement every day can add up. For example, just 30 minutes of daily walking can help boost one’s mood and improve overall health. Other activities include yoga, meditation, swimming and gardening. Remember, you can stay active at any age, and doing something you enjoy will help you stick with it!
Eat a healthy, balanced diet. Eating healthy, regular meals and drinking plenty of water can increase energy and focus. Good nutrition can reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease or diabetes, and it may also help keep your brain healthy. A nutritious diet typically consists of a variety of fruits and vegetables; whole grains; lean meats, fish and poultry; and low-fat dairy. Limiting alcohol and foods that contain high amounts of sugar and salt may also help.
Follow a consistent sleep schedule. Getting enough sleep is important for mental health in older adults, as well as a good immune system. Poor sleep habits can increase the risk of chronic disease. Most healthy adults aged 65 or older need seven or more hours of sleep every night. The National Council on Aging recommends these practices to help improve sleep.
Stay socially connected. The physical and emotional health of older adults is impacted by social connections. Being disengaged can lead to loneliness and even isolation in seniors. This not only affects mental health, but it can have physical consequences as well.
Studies show that people who engage in meaningful, productive activities can improve their mental well-being and cognitive function. Some ways seniors can stay socially connected include:
- Setting aside time each day to stay in touch with family, friends and neighbors, whether in person, over the phone or via video chat
- Taking up a new (or renewing an old) hobby
- Joining a faith-based organization
- Helping others through volunteering or participating in a cause in the community
Practice an attitude of gratitude. Practicing gratitude can make us more emotionally balanced, happier and more positive, which can impact our mental health. Expressing appreciation for others, saying “thank you” and taking actions to show gratitude to the people you care about makes you feel good overall. Send a thank-you note. Remind yourself of the things you are grateful for. Write them down and repeat them daily.
Laugh out loud. A good laugh is healthy for you! It can help you feel more relaxed and reduce anxiety. The simple act of smiling can help to lower your heart rate. Find something to laugh or smile about every day. Focus on the things that make you happy. Have a good laugh with a friend, watch a funny movie, and surround yourself with positive people.
To improve mental health in older adults, family caregivers can encourage their loved ones to incorporate these activities into their daily routines. A healthy body and mind can keep mental well-being intact and help older adults age gracefully.

681,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/ways-to-make-in-home-care-easier/,"There’s no question providing care at home for a loved one is a hard job. Having good resources at hand, both products and services, is a big help. Here are a few of the resources available for patients and for the people who help to take care of them.
Oxygen Concentrators
Oxygen therapy can be a difficult burden for patients and caregivers to take on, especially when first starting. Managing bulky tanks can be physically difficult and seriously limit patient mobility. Having sufficient oxygen supplies on hand is also a work-intensive chore. New oxygen therapy devices called oxygen concentrators are being developed which make providing oxygen therapy significantly easier. Oxygen concentrators work with the ambient air, concentrating the oxygen content to provide higher oxygen levels to patients. Because it distills extra oxygen out of the air, no external oxygen supply is required. Without tanks, these systems are smaller and more convenient, and many are highly portable. Portable oxygen concentrators enable a much greater degree of travel and mobility for patients and their caregivers.
Transportation Services
For people who are unable to drive but who are otherwise able to go out and handle errands or participate in community activities, having reliable transportation services can provide a great deal of freedom. These services can also help to remove some of this responsibility from busy caregivers. In areas where there is not a general public transportation system, such as in many small towns or rural areas, there are often still resources available. Paratransit services offer cars, vans, or buses to transport individuals around their communities. Many of them offer wheelchair-accessible vehicles and can offer door-to-door assistance if needed. Some communities have senior transport or rideshare services for older adults or people with disabilities. Some services are available for set fares, but many others are free.
Meal Delivery Services
Having help with daily meals can help caregivers free up time for other tasks, both necessary caregiving tasks and also personal ones. Such services range from subsidized programs at a low cost to programs which provide specialized meals at higher costs, up to a few hundred dollars per week. There are also services that provide assistance with grocery shopping, deliver groceries to homes, or provide transportation to grocery stores for caregivers or patients who want to cook but lack the time or ability to shop for groceries on their own. If cost is an issue, having assistance with one or two meals per week might be an affordable option that still saves some time and energy for caregivers.
Fall Prevention Tools
One significant worry for some caregivers and older adults who live independently is the danger of falls, which are a leading cause of injury and death among older people. New devices help prevent falls by warning individuals or caregivers when a fall might be imminent. One device monitors a person’s natural gait and is able to detect changes which indicate unsteadiness and alert caregivers. Another option is a walker which can scan a room for tripping hazards and warn the user. While it is impossible to prevent all accidental falls, with such devices helping to monitor and assist individuals who are at risk for falls, caregivers are relieved of some of the burden of watching out for their loved ones in this area.
Electronic Pill Organizer
Managing multiple medication schedules can tax anyone’s memory. To help keep medications on track, an electronic pill organizer can help. These take the idea of a traditional weekly pillbox to a whole new level. Electronic pill organizers remember the schedule for medications for you, for up to two weeks in some models. They sound an alarm when it’s time to take medication and light up the right compartment of the box so that there is no confusion about which pills need to be taken. Using an electronic pillbox can help patients manage their own medications or help caregivers keep track of medications amid all of the other tasks they need to handle.
Patient Lifts
For individuals who have very little mobility, caregivers must be responsible for helping them get into and out of beds, wheelchairs, bathtubs, and other furniture. Patient lifts can assist in doing this safely and comfortably. There are multiple types of hydraulic lifts, so the best one for any given situation will depend on what is needed. Quality lifts must provide good support for patients while being moved, especially supporting the head and neck if necessary.
Professional Care Assistants
Providing care for a loved one can be too big of a job to do alone. Even with good support from family and friends, hiring a professional caregiver can provide extra help to both patients and caregivers. In cases where a patient needs specialized care, a professional caregiver with appropriate training can reliably step in as needed. For older adults who need a lower level of care, adult day programs can give them responsible care and a place to socialize while caregivers handle other responsibilities.

683,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/welcome-aboard-our-first-franchisee/,"It’s been a celebratory week for us here at FirstLight Home Care, as we announced the signing of our first franchisee as well as four additional planned openings in the coming months. Tammy Iuso, 56, who will provide care to clients in the Orlando, Fla. market, is as passionate about providing in-home care as we are.
Tammy’s story is an interesting one. As a first generation Cuban, she has personal ties to the caregiving field since her father was struck by an illness more than 10 years ago. Like many children of elderly or disabled parents, she had difficulty finding a trustworthy caregiver who could provide the constant companionship he needed. When Tammy researched us, she immediately connected with the “Culture of Care” that we are proud to uphold, which integrates trust, open communication and solid relationships to help us build a franchise family that works together. Family, of course, defines a need for in-home care service and the more we can foster that sense of community and connectivity among our care providers, the faster we will grow our network of care.
The wheels are already in motion. In addition to caring for clients in Florida, franchisee Michael LaVell is scheduled to starting serving the Oakland County, Mich. area by late summer or early fall while franchisees Liza Burns and Kim Motter will be serving the south Dayton/northeast Cincinnati area by late summer as well. Things are certainly starting to get busy!
Speaking of being busy . . . I have been doing quite a bit of reading this week on ways to balance caregiving while working a full-time job. The Family Caregiver Alliance with the National Center on Caregiving estimates that one out of every four U.S. households is involved in caring for a loved one age 50 older—and given the rising rates in the Baby Boomer population, the numbers are only going to increase. Consider that nearly 34 million American workers are caregivers for their parents or loved ones. Many sacrifice free time and face added workplace pressures to make up for time spent with a loved one or client.
Thankfully, there are an increasing number of professional options for those choosing to become caregivers, including those who may start working for FirstLight in the coming months.
• Now more than ever, companies are offering flexible work hours—or even remote working options—to those who qualify. This allows people to strike a more optimal balance between career and care.
• The Federal government has extended support to working caregivers through the Family Medical and Leave Act (FMLA), which grants employees up to 12 weeks a year of leave.
• Work-funded counseling and support services can always help caregivers manage the emotional stresses that may ensue from constant work between the job site and a home.
Professional flexibility for caregivers will be essential as we look to expand our business in the coming years. We are excited to be taking the first steps of what will be many more to come! Congratulations to Tammy and all of our future franchisees!"
684,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/weve-got-our-eyes-on-you-national-eye-care-month/,"January is National Eye Care Month. It is also National Glaucoma Awareness Month. This means it’s time to schedule your annual eye exam. It is important, at any age, to have your eyes checked. We asked our own Nurse Gina why it’s important and she gave us these reasons.
- Early Detection: Your eyesight can change in a year so seeing your Ophthalmologist each year will allow you to find out if there are any deformities early on in their development. Addressing eye health issues before they become more severe is a good thing and early treatment will minimize damage to your eyes and vision.
- Protecting Your Future Vision: As we age, we start to gradually lose our vision. The longer you go without an eye exam, the harder it will be for your Ophthalmologist to correct the vision loss.
- Health Issues: A routine eye exam can help detect signs of serious health conditions, like diabetes, a brain tumor, or high cholesterol. Because symptoms of health conditions often don’t appear until damage has already occurred, eye exams are a great way to keep tabs on what’s happening in your body. Your eyes are the only place in your body that provide a clear view of your blood vessels, arteries, and a cranial nerve which can tell your doctor a lot about your overall health.
- Reduce Eye Disease, Glaucoma: More than 3 million people in the United States have glaucoma. The National Eye Institute projects this number will reach 4.2 million by 2030, a 58 percent increase. Glaucoma is called “the sneak thief of sight” since there are no symptoms and once vision is lost, it’s permanent. As much as 40% of vision can be lost without a person noticing. Glaucoma is the leading cause of preventable blindness. January is National Glaucoma Awareness Month. Join us over on Facebook as we share facts and information about this preventable eye disease.
- Quality of Life: Good visual health is critical to your quality of life. It allows you to see the world around you and enjoy everyday activities like driving, reading, watching TV, and playing sports. According to the National Eye Institute, more than 11 million Americans have an uncorrected visual impairment that can impact their quality of life, and in some cases lead to more serious eye conditions. That’s why it is important to see an eye doctor regularly.
Thank you Nurse Gina. All great reasons. Now, let’s all go call our eye doctor and make an appointment."
685,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/what-aids-are-available-to-help-elderly-people-walk/,"Aging not only becomes apparent in the appearance of the skin and hair, it also has a marked effect on the body’s steadiness and ability to move. This is due to the body’s natural deterioration, though issues such as arthritis can also play a part. This can make moving around the house a difficult task and the prospect of going outside in the fresh air a distant hope. However, many aids are available to help elderly people remain independent and walk with renewed confidence.
First, seek advice from an Occupational Therapist
Before you invest in any type of mobility aid, it is recommended that you seek advice from an occupational therapist. These trained professionals will carry out an assessment of the individual and make recommendations as to those aids that are most suitable. This knowledge can prove vital for in creating a safe, controlled environment for an elderly person. Now that we know that, let’s take a look at some of the aids that can help elderly people to walk with renewed confidence.
Walking stick
This is an aid that provides additional stability for elderly people when walking indoors or outdoors. You should make sure that any walking stick you choose is the correct length, or it may mean an elderly person becomes unsteady. Walking sticks tend to feature a rubber ferrule at the bottom which provides additional grip and allows the user to remain steady. Comfort also needs to be considered in terms of the handle and general usability. The technology is advancing, though, with a ‘smart walking stick’ having recently being developed by Fujitsu to include the handy addition of built-in sat-nav. Perhaps a less costly accessory for your walking stick is a cane strap to provide additional support, while there are now also models available that have four grippers at the bottom for improved balance.
Walking frames
These provide additional support for elderly people who may be unstable on their feet or for when they are recovering from an operation. Walking frames are available in different sizes so it is important to choose the correct size in terms of width and height to ensure the user is comfortable and feels safe. A standard walking frame will have four legs, rubber ferrules at the bottom and hand grips. In order to safely use a walking frame, you should walk with the frame surrounding your front and sides, and have your hands firmly on the grips. When in motion, you pick up and place the frame a short distance in front of you, then walk to it and repeat the process. There are now also wheeled walkers available to provide added assistance.
Grab rails
Grab rails can be installed both inside and outside the home to help prevent falls and provide support for elderly people. Grab Rails may prove to be a helpful addition in a number of rooms including the bathroom, bedroom and on the stairs. Where additional support is required outside the home it is sensible to install a grab rail near to the door and in any others areas where additional support is needed. You will need to make sure that any grab rail is fixed safely and securely, however, including such factors as making sure the metal part of the grab rail is earthed before installation.
As a final note, I would like to remind readers that it is advisable for elderly people to seek advice from an occupational therapist before investing in any type of mobility aid.

686,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/what-are-the-early-signs-of-heart-disease/,"Heart disease describes a variety of conditions that affect your heart.
The Mayo Clinic places heart disease under an umbrella of different types of heart or cardiovascular diseases, including blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease; heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias); and heart defects one is born with (congenital heart defects), among others.
Early signs of heart disease depend on what type you have. And, these diseases and symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance, men are more likely to have chest pain; women are more likely to have other symptoms along with chest discomfort, such as shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue.
Heart disease is a serious condition, no matter how it presents itself. Knowing the risks and warning signs can help you keep an eye out for any problems.
Constant fatigue. Some illnesses, and even certain medications, can cause fatigue. However, if you are constantly fatigued or consistently have trouble sleeping, you could be experiencing an early sign of heart failure (a condition in which the heart fails to pump well) or coronary artery disease.
Unexplained aches or pains. Discomfort in the center of the chest that can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain that comes and goes could be an early sign of heart disease. However, for many, the pain is not always felt in the chest. Sometimes it is felt in the shoulders, arms, back, jaw or abdomen.
Shortness of breath. Certain respiratory problems may cause you to feel breathless. However, unexplained shortness of breath that occurs with small amounts of activity, such as walking up a flight of stairs, could indicate heart trouble. Most cases of shortness of breath are due to heart or lung conditions. Your heart and lungs are involved in transporting oxygen to your tissues and removing carbon dioxide, and problems with either of these processes affect your breathing.
You should visit your doctor if you experience any unexplained shortness of breath. Breathing difficulty that comes on suddenly is persistent or interferes with your daily activities should be evaluated by a medical professional.
Swollen feet or ankles. Edema, or swelling, occurs when fluid is trapped in your body’s tissues. It can result in the swelling of your lower legs, ankles, and feet and could be an early sign of a heart problem. The swelling could also be caused by kidney disease, liver failure, eating too much salty food, or a side effect of some drugs. If you or someone you know develops leg pain and swelling that won’t go away, see your doctor. Persistent leg pain and swelling can indicate a blood clot deep in your vein (deep vein thrombosis, or DVT).
Irregular or rapid heart palpitations. For many, most heart palpitations are harmless. They may be caused by anxiety, hormonal changes, medication, excessive caffeine or dehydration. But sometimes palpitations indicate a heart problem. Heart palpitations, along with shortness of breath, dizziness, chest pain, and fainting, could mean a more serious heart condition in which you should see your doctor immediately.
There are some risk factors for heart disease that can’t be changed – such as family history, sex or age – but for the most part, heart disease can be prevented or treated with healthy lifestyle choices. This guide from Family Living Today provides great insight on proactive ways to stay healthy and improve the condition of your heart, including healthy eating and exercise tips and ways to look after both your mental and physical health.

687,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/what-are-the-seven-stages-of-alzheimers/,"Alzheimer’s is a progressive disease that gradually worsens over a period of four to 20 years based on recent data from the Alzheimer’s Association. On average, however, most people live between four to eight years following diagnosis.
The progression of the disease may be different for each person, but typically, the sequence of this disease is consistent. Family caregivers should familiarize themselves with the progression and understand what may happen during each stage of the disease.
Stage One: Normal
In the first stage, a person with Alzheimer’s disease has no memory impairment and no apparent symptoms of dementia. This stage varies in duration and it could be years before an elderly loved one experiences any cognitive change.
Stage Two: Very Mild Cognitive Decline
A person with Alzheimer’s disease will experience forgetfulness. This is the stage between the expected cognitive decline of normal aging and the more severe decline of dementia. It can include difficulties with memory, language and judgment that are greater than normal age-related changes. These symptoms are often not noticed by the individual’s family members or physician.
Stage Three: Mild Cognitive Impairment
Individuals in this stage experience increased forgetfulness as well as slight difficulty with focus or concentration. These deficits, which are subtle, are more likely to be noticed by family members and others who are closely associated with the aging adult. Some of the signs to look for might include:
• Decreased work performance (for those in the workforce)
• Difficulty performing ordinary household tasks such as cleaning or paying bills
• Increased struggle to find the right words in communication
• Repeating the same questions over and over
• Difficulty concentrating
Stage Four: Moderate Cognitive Decline
In this stage, people may be in denial about their forgetfulness and other symptoms, and as socialization becomes increasingly difficult, they may begin to withdraw from family and friends. In this stage, a healthcare provider can easily identify cognitive decline in an examination and interview with the patient.
Stage Five: Moderately Severe Cognitive Decline
During the fifth stage of Alzheimer’s, people begin to need help with many day-to-day activities. Additionally, your aging loved one may have difficulty recalling a recent holiday or visit with a relative. They may have a hard time remembering the week, month or what season of the year it is. Watch for these typical behavior patterns of a loved one in stage five of Alzheimer’s disease:
• Significant confusion
• Inability to recall simple details about themselves, such as their phone number
• Withdrawal from participation in activities and conversations because they are fearful of revealing their deficiencies
Despite the obvious deficits in cognition, persons at this stage can still manage independently in community settings. However, functional capacities become compromised when it comes to activities of daily life. Senior care services such as FirstLight’s Personal Care provide a variety of aid to assist with the activities of daily living.
Stage Six: Severe Cognitive Decline
In this stage, your aging loved one may not be able to live independently and will require substantial assistance to carry out day-to-day activities. You may notice they:
• Have little memory of recent events, as well as of their earlier life
• Forget the names of close friends and family members
• Have difficulty dressing or managing their personal hygiene
• Experience incontinence of bowel or bladder
• Have trouble with their speech
• Experience personality changes such as delusions, anxiety or agitation
It is important at this stage, and really any stage of this progressive disease, to make sure the caregiver takes care of themselves too. FirstLight provides Respite Care so that family caregivers can take short breaks. Stepping away for short periods, or even longer-term if needed.
Stage Seven: Very Severe Cognitive Decline
This is the final stage in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. At this stage, most people will have lost their ability to speak or communicate, and they often require 24-hour assistance with most of their activities, including toileting, eating, dressing and bathing.
If your loved one has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, FirstLight Home Care is here to support you and your family. We help your aging loved one remain in the place they call home, and we support the family caregiver as the disease progresses.
FirstLight Home Care is proud to CHAMPION the family caregiver, offering empathy, advice, and support for those who provide countless hours of care to their loved ones living with Alzheimer’s. We want to provide a helping hand, relieve some of the stress that comes with caregiving and give you back a few hours in your overwhelmingly busy day.

688,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/what-are-the-signs-of-senior-self-neglect/,"Self-neglect among the elderly is a growing problem that commonly goes unreported. We interviewed Nurse Beckie with FirstLight Home Care to learn more about this trend and how to prevent it.
What is senior self-neglect?
Senior self-neglect is when an elderly person is no longer able to meet his or her basic daily needs, which can result in serious health and safety concerns. The Aging Life Care Association has found that self-neglect among seniors is a more common form of non-financial neglect encountered by most caregivers.
“When it is self-neglect and the senior is not able to take care of themselves, it is considered a form of elder abuse. This can happen when the senior lives alone and no one is there to help them,” said Nurse Beckie.
What are the warning signs of senior self-neglect?
- Poor personal hygiene, including not bathing and not taking care of hair, nails, etc.
- Lack of food in the house or expired food being saved.
- Obvious signs of weight loss.
- Poor medication management or refusing to take medications altogether.
- Disengaging from friends and family, not wanting to do go out of the house and not being social. This can lead to loneliness or isolation.
- Unpaid bills bounced checks, or utilities being shut off.
- Dangerous habits, such as leaving the stove on or the front door unlocked.
What should you do if you suspect self-neglect in happening with your senior loved one?
Unfortunately, many seniors in this situation don’t want to accept help from anyone. They believe they’re fine and that there’s nothing wrong. Before you do anything, evaluate the situation carefully.
If you decide to step in, expect some resistance. Many seniors want to maintain their independence and will resent even well-meaning involvement in their day-to-day life activities. It’s important to respect your loved one’s sense of self-determination. They may not appreciate the role reversal when a child tries to parent them!
“It’s not easy to tell an elderly loved one that they’re not taking proper care of themselves. But it’s best to approach the topic and talk to them as soon as you think there may be something wrong. Be sensitive to how they are feeling, but also let them know that you are worried and that you want to help,” suggests Nurse Beckie.
Your loved one might balk at first, but most seniors quickly realize they prefer receiving assistance from a professional rather than from a family member. It preserves their dignity and they see that life is much better with an extra pair of hands.

689,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/what-are-the-symptoms-of-caregiver-burnout/,"April is National Stress Awareness Month. Most people are under some level stress due to everyday life situations, and our family caregiver is not immune. In fact, caregiver burnout is more common than most families think. WebMD defines caregiver burnout as a “state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion that may be accompanied by a change in attitude — from positive and caring to negative and unconcerned”.
Caregivers often burn the candle at both ends. They are so busy caring for their aging loved one and their own family members that they tend to neglect themselves. The demands on a caregiver – both emotional and physical – can easily seem overwhelming, leading to fatigue and hopelessness…and ultimately burnout.
Signs and symptoms of caregiver burnout.
The symptoms of caregiver burnout are like the symptoms of stress and depression. They may include:
- Withdrawal from friends and family
- Loss of interest in activities previously enjoyed
- Feeling blue, irritable, hopeless and helpless
- Changes in appetite, weight, or both
- Changes in sleep patterns
- Getting sick more often
- Feelings of wanting to harm yourself or the person for whom you are caring
- Emotional and physical exhaustion
- Excessive use of alcohol and/or sleep medications
- Irritability
What to look out for and how to protect your long-term health.
Burnout can occur when caregivers don’t get the help they need, or when they try to take on more than they are able. Caregivers who are “burned out” may experience fatigue, stress, anxiety, and depression, and they may feel guilty if they spend time away from the person in their care.
It is so important for the caregiver to stop for a moment to check in with how they’re feeling and get in touch with their own spiritual, physical and emotional needs. Failure to do so may lead to burnout and it may negatively impact their ability to provide care for their loved one. By recognizing the signs and understanding the causes of burnout, a caregiver can take preventative measures to ensure they are properly caring for themselves.
- Negative emotions are normal. Caregiving is a very personal and rewarding experience, but it can also bring a great deal of frustration. The general day-to-day care of a loved one can make for long and demanding hours. Feelings of frustration and anger can occur when you’re exhausted and need a break. These are all normal emotions to experience and do not make you a bad person or caregiver.
- Understand and recognize your limits. There are only so many hours in the day and you are only one person. Caregiving has many duties and it can be difficult to accomplish them all in one day. Unexpected things happen and some of the tasks you wanted to accomplish just may have to wait. Having to push things back or not being able to complete everything on your “to do” list does not make you an inefficient or poor caregiver.
- Ask for help. This seems to be the hardest thing for a family caregiver to do, but it’s the most important thing they can do. Take a stand for yourself and ask family members to take on a certain daily or weekly tasks. Or you can consider hiring a professional who can support you. FirstLight Home Care’s Companion Care or Personal Care services are customized to help both the family caregiver and their loved one. Our extraordinary caregivers know and understand what you’re going through and they are in place to support your needs.
Caregiver burnout is real and should not be dismissed. Communicating regularly and developing solutions with family members, support groups or professional community services and organizations before everything unravels will help ensure that family caregivers maintain a healthy life balance.

691,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/what-do-you-want-your-epitaph-to-say/,"Although I don’t like to think about death very often, I recently attended a 60-th birthday party where they “eulogized” the birthday girl. It was all done in fun, but it got me to thinking: what do I want to be remembered for?
There are people who are very organized and plan their passing down to the minutest detail, including how they want their funeral, the “wake” afterwards, and even what they want their tombstone or grave marker to say. This is probably a good idea, because it makes it easier for the adult son or daughter not to have to take care of all the arrangements when their parents pass away.
When my Mom passed away, her wish was to be cremated and her ashes spread at her favorite place – Hawaii. I loved that idea of course because it meant I got to go there and enjoy the islands as she had enjoyed them. My dad on the other hand, much more traditional, wanted to be buried in a vault he had purchased. There was no room to write anything other than his name and dates of birth and death.
Some people do humorous epitaphs like “pardon me if I don’t get up” or “now touring with the Grateful Dead.”
Others do my solemn epitaphs like “she loved” or “it’s the journey that counts.
There is even a day dedicated to this event – “Write Your Own Epitaph Day”. This holiday is dedicated to pondering about what you want to say about yourself before you’re gone, a day to plan what you want to be remembered about forever.
Think Of An Epitaph As a Way To Succeed
And then I read an article that changed my mind about epitaphs. Whether you are going to have a gravestone or not, an epitaph, whether literally or figuratively, can be a road map to where you are in life, and where you want to end up. It can serve as a moral compass. Think about this. An epitaph can
- Help you set goals
- Make you reflect on your life so far
- Describe what is important to you in a few words
- Show your creativity or sense of humor
- Face your own mortality
- Question whether you accomplished something meaningful
For just a minute, imagine your funeral. What would your family and friends say about you? What would you like them to say about you? If there is a disparity between the two, the good news is that if you are reading this article, you still have time to change before it is too late!"
692,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/what-is-a-pers/,"FirstLight franchisee, Michael LaVell, of Clarkston, Mich. discussed the benefits of a personal emergency response system (PERS) with The Eldercompass Blog earlier this week. Here are a few facts to get started:
Approximately 12 million individuals currently receive home care from over 33,000 providers in the United States according to the National Association for Home Care and Hospice. As many of our nation’s elderly opt to remain in their home as they age, extra measures need to be taken to ensure their safety and independence. Part of maintaining autonomy is being prepared for unforeseen accidents or emergencies that may occur. Investing in a personal emergency monitoring system (PERS) is a great way to help your elderly loved one achieve this goal while giving you peace of mind.
PERS are home devices that connect a person to a 24-hour call center by a transmitter that is typically worn around the neck or wrist. These automated systems have a wide range of benefits including daily reminder notifications regarding medications and appointments. Other advantages cater to people with disabilities such as hearing and visual impairment or mobility challenges. Features include hearing-aid compatible handsets, flashing keypads for incoming calls, oversized keypad numbers and hands-free capabilities.
Depending on the provider, the device can be purchased, rented or leased. The purchase price can range anywhere from $200 to $1500, but many home care providers offer rentals for a modest fee, as low as $25 per month. Be sure to check with your insurance provider; sometimes they will reimburse you if the initial cost is paid for upfront. Many companies are different so it’s important to fully research the cost and monthly payments before signing any contracts.
With falls and medication errors being two of the biggest threats to senior independent living, a PERS is one of the most reliable and affordable ways to ensure your loved one’s safety and security when you or a caregiver aren’t available. FirstLight Home Care is a licensed provider of PERS—visit your local office today for more details."
693,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/what-is-glaucoma-symptoms-treatment-prevention/,"Glaucoma is a disease that damages the eye’s optic nerve. It usually happens when fluid builds up in the front part of the eye. That extra fluid increases eye pressure, damaging the optic nerve. It also can result in partial to complete loss of vision.
Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness in the United States. It can occur at any age but is more common in older adults. The two most common types of glaucoma are primary open-angle and angle-closure glaucoma.
Symptoms of Glaucoma
Most people with this disease have no early warning signs, and often no pain. Doctors recommend that people over the age of 40 who have a family history of the disease should get a complete eye exam every one to two years. Those with health problems, such as diabetes, or a family history of glaucoma may need to go more often.
Primary open-angle glaucoma happens gradually. The symptoms are slow and may go unnoticed, but can include patchy blind spots in peripheral or central vision, and tunnel vision in the advanced stages of the disease. The eye does not drain fluid as well as it should and therefore eye pressure builds and starts to damage the optic nerve. This type of glaucoma is painless and may not cause vision changes at first.
Angle-closure glaucoma occurs when the iris is very close to the drainage angle in the eye. The iris can end up blocking the drainage angle, and when it gets completely blocked, eye pressure rises very quickly. This is called an acute attack. It is a true eye emergency that can cause blindness, and you should call your ophthalmologist right away.
Here are the signs of an acute angle-closure glaucoma attack:
- Sudden blurry vision
- Severe eye pain
- A headache
- Nausea and vomiting
- Seeing halos around lights
Treatment for Glaucoma
The damage caused by glaucoma can’t be reversed. But treatment and regular checkups can help slow or prevent vision loss, especially if the disease is caught in its early stages.
Glaucoma treatment starts with lowering the pressure in the eye (intraocular pressure). Depending on an individual’s situation, glaucoma treatment options may include eye drops, pills, laser surgery, traditional surgery or a combination of these methods.
Prevention of Glaucoma
There are no known ways of preventing glaucoma, however, regular eye exams are the best form of prevention. Early detection and proper treatment upon detection can maintain vision in most people. Other ways to help prevent glaucoma include:
- Exercise: Moderate exercise will benefit overall health. Exercising three or more times each week can reduce elevated intraocular pressure.
- Eye Protection: Wearing protective eyewear is important when you are outdoors or doing activities that could injure your eye. Eye injuries can result in traumatic glaucoma or secondary glaucoma.
If you are a family caregiver and need assistance with your aging senior, such as getting them to and from their eye doctor appointments, we can help. FirstLight offers a number of Senior Care Services to support you.

694,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/what-is-personal-care/,"We Put The “Personal” In Personalized Care
Actually, every service that FirstLight Home Care provides is personalized – whether it’s dementia care, senior care, respite care, care for people with disabilities, or care for the chronically ill. That’s because each of us is unique, with our own schedules, lifestyles and needs.
At FirstLight, we call our home care aides caregivers, because that’s what they do – take care of you. You may have heard them called personal care assistants, companions, or personal support workers. No matter their title, they are passionate about helping you with the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), particularly those involving your personal, physical mobility and therapeutic care needs.
We know that asking for help is never easy, nor is acknowledging that you may need assistance to get up and get going in the morning. At FirstLight Home Care, we’re dedicated to helping you maintain your independence while keeping you safe. You may be capable of taking a shower yourself, but can you do so without falling on a slippery tub? It’s not your abilities that are in question as much as your well-being.
Here are some of the personal services that FirstLight Home Care can provide:
- Bathing – Wouldn’t you like to take a long bath or shower to relax? Personal hygiene aside, warm water is a good cure for many aches and pains.
- Walking – Let’s admit it – as we grow older, we tend to slow down. This can lead to being overweight, out of shape and tired all the time. Not everyone can run a marathon, but some level of activity is often needed. You know that old saying … use it or lose it? Getting from your house to your car may be difficult. Or climbing a flight of stairs can be challenging. Because physical activity is so important, we’ll help you with as much or as little mobility assistance as you need.
- Eating – No more living on fast food! Too often, seniors and the disabled have poor eating habits, mainly because it is a hassle to cook for one person and it’s much more convenient to pop frozen food into the microwave. However, eating a well-balanced meal is extremely important to your overall health, because it can help you reduce your risks for diabetes, bone loss, heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, and more. Plus, not consuming enough calories can leave you feeling lethargic versus energized. We can prepare nutritious meals for you, whether or not you’re on a special diet or just need help coordinating the utensils.
- Getting dressed – Dressing yourself can be one of the hardest tasks of the day. Fastening buttons, snaps and hooks can seem impossible, particularly if you have arthritic hands. We can help you get assistive devices to make dressing easier, trade your old shoelaces for elastic ones, or get you comfy and warm in no time.
- Brushing your teeth – Teeth tend to weaken over time. There is a reason that approximately 5% of seniors age 65 and older have no teeth and that the average senior citizen is missing at least 3 teeth. Brushing your teeth and maintaining good oral hygiene is critical to your physical health as well.
We provide care in your home – wherever home may be either temporarily or permanently. For some of us it’s a retirement community or assisted living facility. For others you may still be in the place where your kids grew up or have transitioned to a smaller home. We do know most people want to stay in their home, where you are both comfortable and familiar.
Whether you need short-term care or long-term care, you’ll find FirstLight Home Care to be exceptionally sensitive to your needs."
695,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/what-is-respite-care-and-why-is-it-needed/,"Caregiving is a full-time job, and respite care is the means to provide relief for the caregiver. It is an ideal solution to give busy and often overstressed family caregivers the opportunity to relax, decompress, and re-energize while their loved one – an elderly parent, a family member living with a disability or a loved one recovering from recent surgery – continues to receive the care they need.
Respite care is important for the health and well-being of the family caregiver to ensure that they can continue to provide care for their loved one. Respite care includes a variety of services such as home-based care, skilled nursing, dementia care, and companion care. A FirstLight Home Care caregiver can help with everything from physical tasks to errands, meal preparation, senior transportation and more.
Respite care for the caregiver is more important than you think. Here are four compelling reasons for the family caregiver to take a break.
- Stress is hazardous to your health. Stress can cause several serious health problems. If you’re too stressed for too long, it can contribute to a weakened immune system as you age and an increased risk of heart disease. Time away from your 24/7 caregiving role also will allow for personal time for you to keep your own family and life organized.
- Isolation is a big problem. We often hear about the harmful effects of isolation and loneliness for aging seniors. However, social isolation can be a big problem for family caregivers as well. It’s important to make social activity part of your daily routine and stay connected with your friends and family on a regular basis.
- Your loved ones will thank you. Caregivers typically have less time for personal relationships as a result of their caregiving duties. Respite care enables caregivers to spend more time with their spouses, children, relatives, and friends who may sometimes feel ignored.
- Time away will help you provide better care. Extended periods of time away from your caregiving role can give you a renewed energy, a fresh perspective and sense of self.
And, please remember this: You should never feel guilty for wanting a break. Every caregiver needs ones. Stepping away for a few hours – or even a couple days here and there – to care for yourself will make you a better caregiver. Don’t forget, hiring a professional respite care provider can help support you while allowing your loved one to be cared for in a familiar environment, comfortable surroundings, and in their daily routine.
If you need caregiving support for the loved one in your care, we can help. Contact FirstLight Home Care today.

696,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/what-is-the-aid-attendance-program/,"Is your parent a Veteran in need of home care? Great news, the Aid and Attendance Program is an improved pension benefit offered by the Veterans Administration that can help pay for home care services. This relatively unknown program is available for Veterans and their spouses who require regular attendance to assist in their daily routines, including eating, bathing, dressing, undressing, and medication dosing, among others. The Aid and Attendance Program can also be used to aid those who are blind or in assisted living facilities due to mental or physical incapacity. Another benefit of this program is that it does not require a Veteran to have a service related injury to qualify since it is a pension benefit provided through the Veterans Administration. You can also use this program to help pay for home care services, allowing your parent to live independent in the comfort of their own home.
For those interested in the Aid and Attendance Program there are a variety of financial benefit levels you can receive. An eligible Veteran can receive up to $1,732 each month, or their surviving spouse can receive up to $1,113 each month. Also, a Veteran with a spouse is eligible for up to $2,054 each month. If their spouse is sick, that Veteran is eligible for up to $1,360 each month. These benefits can be used to help an aging Veteran pay for assisted living costs such as home care which can play a huge financial role in their well being. The amount your parent will receive is dependent on a number of factors which you can read through your application here.
One reason why this program is overlooked by many military families is because they think they don’t qualify. These families believe that the Aid and Attendance program does not pertain to Veterans who live independently even if they have a sick spouse at home. In this situation, if the medical expenses of their sick spouse completely depletes their combined monthly income, the Veteran can file as a Veteran with a sick spouse and still receive the financial benefits.

697,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/what-is-veneration/,"By definition, veneration is the expression of respect or reverence inspired by dignity, wisdom, dedication or talent, often of an elder. Veneration is also a new initiative with an aim to raise awareness of aging Americans, find connections to other generations, find solutions to the challenges facing older adults and rebuild the dignity that our elders deserve.
The Veneration Project was incorporated in 2011 by two sisters, Adina and Sara Saoerstein, who had to care for their mother at a young age. They had no support as they navigated through the complicated legal systems and home care options for their mother. What they learned and what they hope to share with others became Veneration.
The site is aimed at the changing “sandwich generation”—what used to be Boomers who were caught between caring for both their children and aging parents, and is now becoming Gen Xers and Millenials. Through helpful and supportive resources, community activities and communication, the minds behind the Veneration Project hope to open doors to other informal caregivers and ease the stress of these responsibilities.
FirstLight Home Care works with many of these “sandwich generation” parent-children, helping take some of the responsibility and time commitment from busy informal caregivers. By offering non-medical, in-home care, FirstLight caregivers can make your loved one stay comfortable and independent in his or her own home, giving you much-needed time managing your own life.

698,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/what-makes-a-great-caregiver/,"Caregiving is more than just taking care of the physical needs of a senior, a person with disabilities, or someone recovering from surgery. A good in-home caregiver provides support and encouragement. They form a relationship and foster a bond with the person in their care.

If you’re searching for a professional home caregiver, it’s important to choose the person with the right qualities that are a good fit for your loved one. The home caregiver you choose will spend many hours with your loved one, and you want someone who treats him or her in the same way that you would.

699,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/what-makes-a-healthy-brain/,"The human brain is a powerful organ. It controls how we remember, learn, play and concentrate. Practicing brain-strengthening habits every day keeps your mind sharp and can help prevent or delay cognition problems such as Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia.
Here are six tips that could help you maintain a healthier brain and improve brain function.
Exercise daily. Spend at least 30 minutes most days doing some type of activity that gets your heart pumping. Focus on a combination of cardio exercises, strength training, flexibility, and balance. Make sure you are doing activities you enjoy so that you stick with this healthy habit.
Nourish your body. Drink plenty of water and eat a well-balanced, healthy diet. Consume a variety of foods of different colors, including green, leafy vegetables. Foods rich in protein, vitamins and minerals and omega-3 fatty acids are important as well. Minimize alcohol and caffeine (all in moderation). What’s good for the body is good for the brain!
Get plenty of sleep. Sleep is so important because while we sleep, the brain repairs itself and it also completes a lot of important tasks, including preserving key memories and restoring information that was learned during the day. Aim for 6 to 8 hours of sleep each night.
Manage your stress. There is growing evidence that stress damages the brain. Stress also can lead to depression, which can affect your memory and slow brain metabolism. Reduce your stress levels by practicing calming activities like meditation or yoga, exercising regularly and taking time for yourself to just relax.
Stay socially connected. Spend time with friends and family. Regular engagement and social activities with the people you care about can help maintain a healthy brain.
Use your brain. Do activities every day to stimulate your brain. Read a book, do crossword or jigsaw puzzles, play memory games, or a round of scrabble. Consider a program like Ageless Grace. These types of brain fitness programs are meant to exercise the body and stimulate the brain. The Ageless Grace exercises, based on neuroplasticity, activate all five functions of the brain – analytical, strategic, kinesthetic learning, memory/recall, creativity, and imagination. It consists of 21 simple exercises focused on natural, everyday movements and it is designed for all ages and abilities.
At FirstLight Home Care, our goal is to improve the overall health and well-being for you and your aging loved one. We are focused on providing services to help people achieve the quality of life they deserve.

700,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/what-skills-do-you-need-to-be-a-caregiver-2/,"Being a caregiver is a rewarding career path. However, it’s not for everyone. It takes a unique blend of skills and abilities, along with a strong desire to help others. If this sounds like the kind of work that’s a good fit for you, you may be wondering what kind of hard and soft skills you will need to get a caregiver job? Here’s a look at a few:
Hard Skills You’ll Need As a Caregiver
Physical Strength: Caregivers perform many physical tasks and duties each day that require strength and stamina. Some of these include helping an individual with mobility issues, assisting with bathing and dressing, carrying groceries and performing light housekeeping chores. You’ll be on your feet for much of your workday, requiring a high level of energy to tackle all your responsibilities.
In addition, if you have evening or overnight shifts, you’ll need to be able to stay awake and alert, standing by ready to help your client. This is an active job that requires a physically healthy, high-stamina individual.
First Aid & CPR: As a caregiver, it’s likely you’ll encounter an emergency situation at some point in your career. You’ll need to know the proper steps to take with First Aid and CPR training.
Many clients will be elderly or chronically ill and can fall, get hurt or suffer from a stroke or heart attack. It’s critical to know what to do in these situations, whether it’s tending to a minor cut or performing CPR until emergency responders arrive. To become certified in CPR and First Aid, you’ll need to enroll in a training certification course.
Soft Skills You’ll Need As a Caregiver
Empathy: Empathy is the ability to step into another person’s shoes and feel what they are experiencing. It is an important skill to have since it will help you tune into your client so you know what they need, even when they’re not able to articulate it. Empathy is at the core of good caregiving because it helps you to better understand what your client is going through and provide the proper level of care.
Compassion: Compassion is another critical part of being a caregiver and goes hand-in-hand with empathy. When you’re empathetic, you can understand how the person feels and then treat them with compassion. This means you’ll show them kindness, respect and love so they maintain their dignity. It also means you’ll work hard to alleviate their pain, distress or whatever is ailing them so they’re more comfortable. A caring, compassionate heart is an absolute must-have to become an effective caregiver.
Communication: Excellent communication skills are vital. This includes your ability to listen – to the individual you’re caring for and their family – as well as other members of that person’s care team, like a doctor or a nurse. You’ll also need to feel comfortable interacting with families, reporting on progress and accurately explaining new situations to them as their loved one’s needs change. This is important to ensuring your client is getting the right level of care to remain safe and healthy. It also helps to improve your relationship with the individual you’re caring for and their family.
Flexibility: A client’s condition can change quickly. It’s why you have to be flexible when it comes to how you approach the job. One shift might go smoothly, while the next one is filled with challenges. You must be able to adapt as needed and still stay positive and professional.
When it comes to scheduling, flexibility is also important since caregiving is often delivered in the evenings, overnight and on weekends. It’s not always a nine-to-five job. The ability to be flexible and solve problems will be a big part of your day.
Organization: When you’re a caregiver, you’re not sitting at a desk with your supervisor monitoring you. Your work is performed independently, often in an individual’s home, which means it is up to you to prioritize tasks and manage your time wisely so you can complete all of your responsibilities during your shift. It’s also critical you show up on time so the people you’re caring for and their families come to trust and rely on you.
Observation: Being observant is another skill that is key to being an effective caregiver. Observing when an individual isn’t eating as much as they usually do, if there are new hazards in the home or if living conditions are messier than usual are all important. You should also be aware of new physical changes, like an increase in fatigue or irritability.
During each visit, part of your job is to keep a sharp eye out for any of these and other red flags or warning signs. You’ll then have to report them to your employer and to the individual’s family. This can help you and the whole care team stay on top of new issues as they’re emerging and before they escalate into a dangerous situation. In fact, a keen eye can save a person’s life.
Patience: Caregiving is going to test your patience. You’ll have situations that are frustrating and often occur after a long day on your feet, whether it’s from messes that require clean-up to an irrational reaction from the person you’re caring for. No matter what happens, you must remain patient, positive and upbeat. You can vent when you’re off the clock, but will need to remain focused, calm and able to handle many different stressors during any given day.
A Love of People: Working as a caregiver means you’re going to be interacting with another person all the time. While you’ll need to help in practical ways, like preparing meals and grocery shopping, you’ll also be providing companionship, conversation and emotional and social support. If you are not a “people person,” caregiving is likely not the best fit for you. It’s important you’re the type of individual who can build camaraderie, trust and respect with your client, so their needs are met.
Clearly, being a caregiver requires a special person, someone with a big heart for others. If this sounds like it would be a good match for your personality and abilities, consider a job at FirstLight® Home Care.
We are actively hiring across our many locations and always on the lookout for those who want to make everyday life easier for the clients we serve. While previous experience is preferred, we do offer paid training and ongoing education opportunities.

701,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/what-to-know-about-covid-19-vaccination/,"As Americans get vaccinated over the coming months, it is important to keep following public health safety measures to protect yourself, your family and your community. The Centers for Diseases Control (CDC) continues to emphasize the following:
In general, the more closely you interact with others and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread.
If you decide to engage in public activities, continue to protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions like wearing a mask, staying at least 6 feet apart and avoiding crowds.
Keep these items on hand when venturing out: a face mask, tissues, and a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if possible.
If you have questions about COVID-19 vaccination, read the following information we gathered from several trustworthy sources to help answer your questions and provide additional information.

702,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/whats-the-best-advice-your-dad-has-given-you/,"Father’s Day is this Sunday. In celebration of all the dads out there – and the impact they have on our lives – we asked FirstLight Home Care team members to share the paternal words of wisdom that have proved to be true in their lives over the years. The response from our owners and other team members was inspiring! Here are more than a dozen great pieces of fatherly advice from our very own FirstLight family.
My father taught us kids to drive. There were four of us. Dad was always very calm. He always said, “Keep right on the tail of the car ahead of you in a left-hand turn lane, so everyone gets around the corner.” He also taught us to never pass someone on the interstate and then just get right in ahead of them, cutting them off. He taught most of my cousins, and his sisters, and sisters-in-law, and my mother, too. People that we didn’t even know showed up at his funeral and said that he had taught them to drive. He really touched a lot of lives. He is why I got into home care. Susan Lindgren, Owner, FirstLight Home Care of Plainfield, IN
“Nothing good happens after midnight.” Raelene Plummer, Owner, FirstLight Home Care of Northwest Arkansas
My dad always instilled in me the importance of managing your money. I don’t know that he ever gave me direct advice, but it was more about the example he set. My parents always put much thought into how they spent their money. They lived in a modest home and never took extravagant vacations. And they managed to give 4 girls a Catholic education on one household income. While I consider myself a saver and pretty good at managing my money, I also make sure to live a little because you can’t take it with you! Cresta Lewis, PR & Social Media Manager, FirstLight Home Care Home Office
“If you are going to dig ditches, do it better than all the others.” Scott Topping, Co-Owner, FirstLight Home Care of Honolulu, HI
My dad gave me this advice when I got married. “Be careful of what you say, words once out are like an arrow out of the bow, once it’s out, it is gone. Words can make or break a relationship.” Lolita Pinto, Owner, FirstLight Home Care of Rancho-Cucamonga, CA
Know your surroundings. Be able to give a good description. Don’t get smart with police when pulled over and don’t use my name to get out of a ticket. Stay locked and loaded. I come from a law enforcement family. ? Nancy Coin, Client Care Coordinator, FirstLight Home Care of Riverview, FL
“Have fun but be careful!” Ally Waters, Director of Marketing FirstLight Home Care Home Office
“If you tell someone you are going to do something or be somewhere, then do it!” Ken Fleming, Owner, FirstLight Home Care of Charlotte, NC and FirstLight Home Care of Fort Mill & Rock Hill, SC
Money: “Don’t ever charge more on a credit card than you can pay off in one month.” (I revised that to 3 months but only on occasion!) Business: “Keep it simple. You got money coming in and money going out. As long as the money coming in is more, you are doing okay!” Dating: (He was 100% Italian!) “Watch out for those curly haired bad****s, cuz your father was one of ’em!” (Thanks, dad, for the heads up!) LOL! Jaye McCoy, Owner/President, FirstLight Home Care of Greater Omaha West and Northeast
“Be who you want to be!” Daryl Beckles, Director of Human Resources, FirstLight Home Care Home Office
The best advice my Dad ever gave me is, “Never go to bed mad at one another because tomorrow is never a guarantee.” He has also said, “Always reach for the stars, you never lose, you either win or you learn.” And to this day I live by those words. Kourtney Tello, Care Coordinator, FirstLight Home Care of Macomb County/Grosse Pointe, MI
When I turned 25, my dad told me if I thought the first 25 went by fast, that I should hold on, as the next 25 would fly by. In other words, pay attention to what is happening each and every day of your life. Time passes by so fast, you can miss the most important things, so hold on!!! Bill Whitener, Owner, FirstLight Home Care of Central Polk County, FL
Why I take the stairs: William E. Harned, 1923-2017: My father lived healthy until he died last year at age 93. His best advice was not in words, but in how he lived. Dad walked daily, in previous years a measured mile. He also ate limited portions at meals, watched his weight and blood pressure and generally followed doctor’s orders. (He did not always listen to our advice.) And one more thing, I enjoyed watching Dad and several others on one of two senior bowling leagues up until some knee and heart issues shortly after turning 90. Dad’s best advice was his example of living healthy and getting out of the house to be with family and friends. Roger Harned, National Alliance Coordinator, FirstLight Home Care Home Office – Back to work for FirstLight after a brief semi-retirement at age 65

703,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/when-the-daughter-becomes-the-mother/,"Today’s post was written for us by Cindy Smith, a close friend and client of FirstLight Home Care. Here’s what she has to say about her experiences finding care for her elderly mother.
However, the person I am taking care of is not a child. It is my mother, one of the most precious people in my life.
My father was always the healthy one, the strong one, invincible in his own way. Never been in the hospital, hardly ever had a sick day in his 50 years as an accountant. My mother was always the sickly one, having been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and lupus in her 20s. When my mother had to have an emergency colostomy when she was 78, I still remember my dad’s exact words: “Don’t worry honey, I will he here to take care of you.”
That same year, he died unexpectedly. Shock #1. He was going to be the caregiver, the one who took care of her “until death do them part.” How could he be gone? However, I didn’t have time to grieve, because suddenly my Mom was all alone and could not take care of herself.
I live in Colorado, my Mom lives in Arizona. I couldn’t move her to Colorado, because of our altitude and her respiratory problems. I couldn’t move there, because I have a full-time job and at the time, had two kids in school.
So what to do?
And that is the question many of us baby boomers are faced with. Overnight, according to the National Alliance for Caregiving, I became one of the 69 million people, or 29% of the US population that cares for an elderly parent. And like most caregivers, I love my Mom and would do anything to make her happy.
Like many elderly people, she wanted to stay in the comfort of her home. Adjusting to the loss of my dad was one thing, so uprooting her seemed cruel. At first I thought about hiring a caretaker on my own. One person who would live in with her. But what happened if that person got sick? There was no backup. Plus my Mom required medications in the middle of the night.
So then I mentioned a homecare agency … her friends told me horror stories! “They’ll steal all her things”, “they’ll mistreat her and you’ll never know because you live thousands of miles away”, and my favorite “they’ll steal all her drugs and sell them on the street, ” were their comments. Compounding my stress was my guilt that I was not going to be the one with her.
Shock #2. Her peers were wrong. There are great homecare companies out there that provide 24/7 care. It’s a matter of finding the right one, interviewing the caregivers and talking to other people who have used them in the past. I asked around – her doctors and social workers at Mayo Clinic – and even my friends and their friends on Facebook. I did my homework and research.
I happen to be familiar with FirstLight Home Care who have locations throughout the United States. I liked them immediately because they were reputable, friendly and honest people who truly understood my pain and stress. But most importantly, they loved my mother!
If I can save any other adult daughters looking for homecare some stress, I would pass along this advice from one who has been there:
1. Communicate with the homecare agency. Tell them what your Mom likes to do, her routines, and even her favorite foods (my Mom hates lima beans). Tell them little things like pet peeves (my Mom is a neat freak). As issues arise, talk to them about it. My Mom is 84 and often gets confused … in cases of dementia, this is even more critical. Don’t jump to conclusions … get both sides of the story.
2. Write it down. No one can remember everything. Write things down as updates occur, I email them!
3. Prepare a job description. You need to tell them what you expect them to do. Housework? Medication? Errands? Transportation? In my Mom’s case, it was all of the above. Also, are there any special issues? For instance, my mom has a colostomy and a catheter, both situations requiring special care.
4. Background checks. Another plus for using a professional homecare agency is you do not have to use background checks … they do them for you.
5. Show your appreciation. My mom had two main caregivers – each in 12 hour shifts. It’s not an easy job. I remembered the caregiver’s birthdays and special holidays. Many times the caregivers went above and beyond, and I sent them gift cards in the mail. And it’s not just about money – compliment them.
6. Schedule unexpected visits. In the beginning before we settled into a routine, I scheduled unexpected visits. Because I generally fly to Arizona every other month to see my Mom anyway, this was easy. And I’m happy to say, there were no ugly surprises.
Having my Mom in her home for three years was great. Having a homecare agency like FirstLight Home Care I could depend on was a blessing.
Unfortunately, my Mom’s condition has worsened and now she is in skilled care. But you know what? I still have her caregiver spend a morning with her one/day a week. It’s continuity for my Mom and companionship. Plus I know the caregiver sneaks her french fries from McDonald’s all the time … how endearing is that? They are the best of friends!
Did I ever think I would assume the role of adult in our mother-daughter relationship? No. But you know what? When I think about all the things my Mom did for me growing up and all the sacrifices she made (okay, those dance recitals were brutal), I’m grateful I can even payback a slice of the love she gave to me."
704,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/when-to-consider-home-care/,"If you traveled home for the holidays and spent some time with your elderly parents, you may have noticed they need a little extra assistance at home. Although it can often be difficult to know when your loved one is no longer able to live independently, there are some tell-tale signs.
Perhaps their home isn’t as clean as it used to be. Or they have expired food in the fridge or pantry. Maybe their personal hygiene has gone by the wayside. Or they have some new dents and scratches on their car.
We’ve collected a few of our most-read blog posts that we think are helpful for family caregivers who are considering hiring a professional caregiver for their aging parent.
Know when to consider home care
Many adult children wonder when it’s time to consider home care for a loved one. If you find yourself stopping over more often to check on your aging parents or asking a friend or neighbor to stop by, it might be the time to look at in-home care options.
In-home care can provide vital support
Maybe your parent needs short-term assistance. Temporary in-home care can help individuals who are recovering from illness, injury or surgery, as well as after a hospital stay. This short-term care can last anywhere from several weeks to a few months, and it is typically provided in someone’s home. This care can provide a long-term boost to what your loved one needs most – comfort, confidence and peace of mind.
Find the best possible caregiver
Doing the proper research to ensure your parents are taken care of as they age – physically, emotionally and financially – will help give you peace of mind in the future. While researching care for your parents, take time to look for a caregiver who is patient, compassionate, detail-oriented, and present. You’ll be able to rest easy knowing that the person you love the most is being taken care of by someone who has their best interest and wellbeing at the forefront.
If you are a family caregiver, keep these in mind while researching home care for your parents.
Get In-Home Support

706,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/who-pays-for-home-care/,"There comes a time in our lives when we must address the possibility of our parents needing home care. However, many people are concerned that with their limited budget they cannot afford to pay for it out-of-pocket. This is a difficult reality that most families will have to face, but home care is often the only alternative to placing their loved ones in a nursing home. The good news is that there are plenty of financial aid services that can help cover professional home care expenses. The following is a list of some financial alternatives that can help you pay for home care services.
Medicare
Medicare will pay for professional home care services for eligible senior citizens. In addition to home care services, Medicare will cover nursing, physical, occupational, and
speech therapy services. The downside is that it has a very strict criteria that individuals must meet before receiving financial benefits.
Medicare Advantage Plans
More often than not, managed care plans often include coverage for home care services. Medicare Advantage plans are managed care plans for seniors that provide the same
benefits as standard Medicare but require prior authorization for home care services.
Medicaid
If an elder is low-income, Medicaid programs will support home care services in most states as an alternative to nursing homes. Medicaid is a joint federal-state medical
assistance program that requires states to provide home health services for
individuals in certain categories, such as aged, disabled, or blind.
Medigap Insurance
Sometimes even with the support of Medicare an individual will have gaps coverage that can leave them unable to pay for necessary services. Medigap Insurance is designed
to bridge these gaps in Medicare coverage. In order for it to help cover home care costs, a member must be receiving skilled home health care benefits and the patients physician must order this care.
Veterans’ Administration
Through the CHAMPVA program, active-duty or retired veterans of the U.S. military and their spouses, widows, and dependents can receive financial help for home care. In
addition, veterans who are at least 50% disabled due to service-related injuries and conditions are eligible for home care financial aid. If you or a loved one is a veteran and interested in their eligibility for these services, call 877-222-8387.
Private Insurance
If your parents have private insurance it should cover some home care services for patients with acute needs. However, longer care plans typically vary by insurer. The good news is that most plans will cover some of the expenses of home care when the patient is responsible for cost-sharing.
Long Term Care Insurance
As long as specific conditions are met, most long term care insurance programs will cover home care services. In order to determine if these conditions are met, insurance providers use “benefit triggers”. Although there are plenty of various benefits triggers, one common one is whether or not an individual can perform a certain number of daily living activities without assistance. The down side of long term care insurance is that individuals are often put on an elimination or waiting period before their home care services can become covered."

Although the thought of getting a shot is not pleasant, the effect of not getting the shot is even worse! The flu can cause moderate symptoms, but in many seniors, it can be fatal.
Here Nurse Gina with FirstLight Home Care answers the most common questions about the flu and how to protect both you and your family against this all too common illness.
Who Should Receive the Vaccine?
First, all children aged 6 months and older should be vaccinated annually, with rare exceptions, particularly if you are at an increased risk for complications. It is highly recommended that individuals with chronic illnesses, those susceptible to respiratory illnesses or who have low immune systems get the vaccine. It is also suggested for caregivers such as doctors, nurses, and nurses’ aides who regularly come in contact with patients.
Special Consideration Regarding Egg Allergy
People who have ever had a severe allergic reaction to eggs, or who have a severe allergy to any part of this vaccine, may be advised not to get vaccinated. People who have had a mild reaction to egg—that is, one which only involved hives—may receive the flu shot with additional precautions. Make sure your healthcare provider knows about any allergic reactions. Most, but not all, types of flu vaccine contain small amount of egg.
Those Who Should Not Receive the Flu Shot (TIV)
If you have had an allergic reaction to a prior vaccination, do not get the influenza vaccine.
Next, anyone with a history of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (a severe paralytic illness, also called GBS) that occurred after receiving an influenza vaccine and who are not at risk for a severe illness from influenza should generally not receive vaccine. Tell your doctor if you ever had Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Your doctor will help you decide whether the vaccine is recommended for you.
Those people who are moderately or severely ill with or without a fever should usually wait until they recover before getting flu vaccine. If you are ill, talk to your doctor about whether to reschedule the vaccination. People with a mild illness can usually get the vaccine.
The Flu Vaccination Itself
Why should people get vaccinated against the flu?
Influenza is a serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes even death. Every flu season is different, and an influenza-related infection can affect people differently. Even healthy people can get very sick from the flu and spread it to others. Over a period of 31 seasons between 1976 and 2007, estimates of flu-associated deaths in the United States range from a low of about 3,000 to a high of about 49,000 people. During a regular flu season, about 90% of deaths occur in people ages 65 years and older. The “seasonal flu season” in the United States can begin as early as October and last as late as May.
During this time, flu viruses are circulating in the population. An annual seasonal flu vaccine (either the flu shot or the nasal-spray flu vaccine) is the best way to reduce the chances that you will get seasonal flu and spread it to others. When more people get vaccinated against the flu, less flu can spread through that community.
How do flu vaccines work?
Flu vaccines cause antibodies to develop in the body about two weeks after a vaccination. These antibodies provide protection against an infection with the viruses that are in the vaccine.
What kinds of flu vaccines are available?
There are several flu vaccine options for the 2013-2014 flu season.
Traditional flu vaccines made to protect against three different flu viruses (called “trivalent” vaccines) are available. In addition, flu vaccines made to protect against four different flu viruses (called “quadrivalent” vaccines) also are available.
The trivalent flu vaccine protects against two influenza A viruses and an influenza B virus.
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) does not recommend one flu vaccine over the other. The important thing is to get a flu vaccine every year.
When should I get vaccinated?
Flu vaccinations should begin soon after vaccine becomes available, ideally by October. However, as long as flu viruses are circulating, a vaccination should continue to be offered throughout the flu season, even in January or later. While seasonal influenza outbreaks can happen as early as October, most of the time influenza activity peaks in January or later. Since it takes about two weeks after getting the vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body, it is best that people get vaccinated so they are protected before influenza begins spreading in their community.
Flu vaccine is produced by private manufacturers, so availability depends on when production is completed. Shipments began in late July and August and will continue throughout September and October until all of the available vaccine is distributed.
Where can I get a flu vaccine?
Flu vaccines are offered in many locations, including doctor’s offices, clinics, health departments, pharmacies and college health centers, as well as by many employers, and even in some schools.
Even if you don’t have a regular doctor or nurse, you can get a flu vaccine somewhere else, like a health department, pharmacy, urgent care clinic, and often your school, college health center, or work.
Can I get seasonal flu even though I got a flu vaccine this year?
Yes. There is still a possibility you could get the flu even if you get vaccinated. The ability of the flu vaccine to protect a person depends on various factors, including the age and health status of the person being vaccinated, and also the similarity or “match” between the viruses used to make the vaccine and those circulating in the community. If the viruses in the vaccine and the influenza viruses circulating in the community are closely matched, vaccine effectiveness is higher. If they are not closely matched, vaccine effectiveness can be reduced. However, it’s important to remember that even when the viruses are not closely matched, the vaccine can still protect many people and prevent flu-related complications. Such protection is possible because antibodies made in response to the vaccine can provide some protection (called cross-protection) against different but related influenza viruses.
Vaccine Side Effects (What to Expect)
Can the flu vaccine give me the flu?
No, a flu vaccine cannot cause the flu. Flu vaccines that are administered with a needle are currently made in two ways: the vaccine is made either with a) flu vaccine viruses that have been ‘inactivated’ and are therefore not infectious; or b) with no flu vaccine viruses at all (which is the case for recombinant influenza vaccine). The nasal spray flu vaccine does contain live viruses. However, the viruses are attenuated (weakened), and therefore cannot cause the flu. The weakened viruses are cold-adapted, which means they are designed to only cause infection at the cooler temperatures found within the nose. The viruses cannot infect the lungs or other areas where warmer temperatures exist.
Different side effects can be associated with the flu shot and nasal spray flu vaccines. These side effects are mild and short-lasting, especially when compared to symptoms of influenza.
The flu shot: The viruses in the flu shot are killed (inactivated), so you cannot get the flu from a flu shot. Some minor side effects that could occur are: Soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given, Fever (low grade), and Aches.
The nasal spray: The viruses in the nasal spray vaccine are weakened and do not cause severe symptoms often associated with influenza illness. In children, side effects from the nasal spray can include: runny nose, wheezing, headache, vomiting, muscle aches, and fever.
In adults, side effects from the nasal spray vaccine can include: runny nose, headache, sore throat, and cough.
If these problems occur, they begin soon after vaccination and are mild and short-lived. Almost all people who receive the influenza vaccine have no serious problems from it. However, on rare occasions, flu vaccination can cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. People who think that they have been injured by the flu shot can file a claim for compensation from the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP).
Protect yourself, your family and everyone you come in contact with by getting a flu shot."
708,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/why-family-caregivers-should-consider-joining-a-support-group/,"Caring for a family loved one can be a rewarding experience, but it can also be overwhelming. The family caregiver is only human, and they need both emotional and practical support to maintain a healthy self. Joining a local support group is one solution to help the family caregiver feel less isolated, and it provides the opportunity to be around people who know exactly what they’re going through.
The benefits of joining a support group.
Research has shown that participating in caregiver support groups has many benefits and can significantly improve the quality of life for the caregiver and their family.
- Caregiver support group members can validate each other’s experiences to help confirm that what you’re feeling is normal.
- They can provide you with a place to ask for advice and find useful resources to support your family situation.
- Support groups can help a caregiver feel less lonely, isolated or judged.
- Group meetings will give you a chance to step away from caregiving which can help reduce distress, depression or anxiety.
- Caregiver support groups can help you have a clearer understanding of what to expect with your situation as time goes on.
How to find the right support group.
- Search Online. Using keywords like “caregiver support group” or “caregiver network” should deliver local website results to get you started. Eldercare Locator, a public service of the U.S. Administration on Aging, is another resource to help connect a family caregiver to local groups, support organizations, and services.
- Start a Conversation. Another great way to find a caregiver support group in your area is by speaking with organizations that work with local seniors. Community organizations, including local charities, senior-focused programs (like a Meals on Wheels), senior centers, faith groups, and senior care companies (like a local FirstLight Home Care) are well connected in the community and can give you recommendations.
- What’s Right for You? Are you looking for a condition-specific group, a support group that is peer-lead or lead by a trained facilitator? Are you looking for a group that is online or can be available by telephone? Having a better understanding of the types of groups that are available for what you need right now is important. You can always consider another type of group as your needs change.
What questions should you ask and what can you expect?
Support groups are not all the same. You will need to ask questions to find out if a specific group is right for you and to give you a better understanding of what to expect from the group.
- Understand the structure of the meetings. Some groups have a trained leader, others don’t.
- Peer-led support groups have group leaders that have been in a caregiving situation and can share their first-hand experience and resources.
- Trained facilitator support groups are led by social works, clergy, psychologists or other professionals. They will provide a place to share, but they will also provide services to support your situation – including educational programs, elder or legal aid, adult day-care providers and other elder care related professionals.
- Ask about the group’s confidentiality policy. You’ll want to find a group that maintains a high level of confidentiality of the conversations had within the group.
- Do not feel like you must jump in and divulge everything right away. Typical support groups create an environment where members are free to discuss problems or share news as soon as they feel comfortable doing so.
- Go in knowing that most groups are free. You should not feel pressured to join an association or pay dues.
- Don’t feel obligated to stay with a group if it doesn’t feel right for you.
When you decide to join a caregiver support group, keep an open mind. Many caregiving challenges are very similar – including the overall emotional stress, dealing with the healthcare system, caregiver burnout, day-to-day caregiving demands, and the challenges of managing another person’s care in addition to your own family and personal life.
Regardless of your specific situation, a well-run caregiver support group will provide you with a safe space. The group should be a place for you to share stories, discuss your feelings and get/give advice with people who can relate, without judgment.
Knowing that you are not alone in your family caregiving situation can make a world of difference.

709,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/why-its-important-to-manage-caregiver-stress/,"Family caregivers face a lot of stress. Many work full-time jobs and raise their own families on top of the responsibilities of looking after their aging parent. The demands of the job can take both a physical and mental toll on even the most resilient people, leaving them drained and exhausted. In order to be more patient and available, it’s important to keep caregiver stress within manageable boundaries. These tips reveal why it’s important for family caregivers to lower their stress levels and how to do so every day.
Why is stress bad?
While a little stress is natural, too much can cause long-term problems. Prolonged exposure to stressful situations can leave caregivers more vulnerable to developing health issues. It can raise your blood pressure, lower the strength of your immune system, and lead to long-term diseases like heart disease or stroke. This demanding lifestyle can also interrupt sleep while causing irritability and headaches. Certain caregivers are at an exceptional risk of feeling stress – females, live-in caregivers and those with depression often have higher stress levels than others.
Caregiver stress can not only lead to illness, but it can also preoccupy your mind and lower your patience with whomever you’re caring for. It’s important to make sure you’re regulating your stress levels and identifying when you need to take a step back to look after yourself before others.
Signs of stress
Recognizing your own stress levels might be more difficult than you think, especially if you’re used to working through stress. Make sure you know how to spot the signs so you can take steps to lower your anxiety levels and take better care of yourself.
- Chronic fatigue, no matter how much sleep you get
- A constant pit in your stomach, or often feeling overwhelmed
- Losing interest in hobbies
- Muscle aches and tension
- Frequent colds and flu-like symptoms
How to lower caregiver stress levels
- Prioritize sleep. Sleep helps regulate your stress hormone levels, boosting mood and rejuvenating the brain. Whether it’s switching up your bedding, or finding a calming bedtime routine, there are a lot of different ways to help you get 7-9 hours of sleep a night and control your stress.
- Make a schedule. Caregiving can often come with a long list of overwhelming tasks. To keep your head clear, list your responsibilities and create a realistic hourly schedule in which you can accomplish them. Realize, however, that you might have to prioritize more important tasks.
- Find support. Remaining connected with others is a great way to reduce feelings of stress. Lean on family, friends and community groups to provide emotional support when you need it. If you still feel persistent stress, consider speaking with your doctor.
We understand how stressful family caregiving can be, but hopefully, these tips will help you learn to manage the demands of the job while remaining relaxed and happy.

710,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/why-seniors-want-to-age-in-place/,"If you even mention the words “assisted living” or “nursing home” to your parents, chances are the words make them cringe. The thought conjures up images of loneliness, being surrounded in an unfamiliar environment with people that are strangers. In fact, most seniors fear moving out of their home more than death.
In fact, nearly 90 percent of seniors want to stay in their own homes as they age even if they need day-to-day assistance. In a study conducted by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) only 9% of seniors prefer to move to a facility where health care is provided and only 4% are amenable to moving into a relative’s home.
The desire to age in place is overwhelmingly the favorite choice.
What is Aging in Place?
The Center for Disease Control defines aging in place as “the ability to live in one’s own home and community safely, independently, and comfortably, regardless of age, income, or ability level.” It generally means as you grow older, you don’t have to move.
Why Do Seniors Want to Live at Home?
Seniors give a number of reasons for wanting to age at home. They include:
- To maintain freedom & independence
- To live by their own rules
- To stay near to their friends
- To remain in a place that is familiar
- It is less expensive than a nursing home or assisted living facility
- To prevent “relocation stress”
Many times whether an individual can stay at home or not depends on factors that include financial, healthcare and safety issues. Planning is required to accommodate the physical, mental, and psychological changes that inevitably accompany aging. Things to consider include failing eyesight and hearing, and health care needs resulting from arthritis, dementia, osteoporosis, heart disease or hypertension. Often decreased mobility and flexibility come with aging, making changes to the home essential.
Modifying a Seniors Home for Safety
At FirstLight Home Carey, our goal is to help seniors age in place as independently and with as much dignity as possible. We can provide a lot of help around the home, whether companion care, personal care or dementia care is needed. We can help with running errands, transportation, providing medication reminders, cooking healthy meals and more. Our job is to provide the support services to make aging in place possible.
What we often find is that with some modifications, a home environment is often the safest and most psychologically fulfilling place for seniors to age. It’s where they feel the most comfortable, a place that feels secure and familiar.
Many technological innovations have made it easier for seniors to remain at home. Some changes that may need to be made include:
- Grab bars in the bathrooms and bath seat in the tub and shower
- A phone in the bathroom
- Chairs that are easy to get in and out of
- Stairs that are carpeted to prevent falls
- Telephones and doorbells that can be easily heard
- Cabinet shelves and closets that make it easy to reach objects
- Well lit walkways and entrances
- Carpeting with a low pile and firm pad
- Floors have slip resistant rugs
- Doors made wide enough for a walker
When one of our Care Coordinators walks through a senior’s home, not only do we make an individualized care plan, but we make suggestions to make a home aging-in-place friendly. All of FirstLight Home Care’s caregivers are bonded and insured and our employees are covered by workers compensation and are regularly supervised. Caregivers may work for a client a few hours per day or 24 hours seven days a week.
If a senior has a medical need that requires the expertise of a RN, physical therapist or some other medical specialty, we work hand in hand with other healthcare providers to help our clients.
At FirstLight Home Care, we make aging in place possible!"
711,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/why-we-love-selfie-sticks/,"If you love to capture the moment (with you in the picture, no doubt) you just flip your camera around on your phone and snap away. But in all honesty, that is so old school. Now we want to not only capture ourselves in the moment, but we also want to include family, friends, groups of random strangers, and the scenery behind you. You need a selfie stick. We love them. The selfie stick removes that awkward pose when you raise your arm or your shoulder hunches up. Not sure if a selfie stick is right for you? Here are some advantages and features that we love about them:
- They are easy to use.
- They are compatible with most smartphones that have a width of 3.25 inches.
- They’re inexpensive to purchase. (Hint: the holidays are just around the corner – a super fun stocking stuffer).
- They are lightweight, compact and easy to bring with you – everywhere you go.
- You no longer have to capture only the people or area that you can capture at an arm’s length. The selfie stick allows you to capture more by increasing the length of the stick.
- You don’t have to ask a complete stranger to take your photo.

712,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/wii-by-nintendo-an-effective-way-for-seniors-to-exercise-and-have-fun/,"Video games often get a bad rap, especially when it comes to how many hours young kids and teenagers can be glued to them. Hours of sedentary sitting along with the less-than-nutritious diets of many children are a recipe for an overweight, unhealthy generation. But, video game promoters and advocates can create a case for the positives of video games for kids.
Are there also benefits for seniors? The resounding answer seems to be YES!
Nintendo has been around since 1985, and they continuously come out with new and improved video games. Starting with the Nintendo Entertainment Systems, moving on to GameBoy, Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64 and so many more.
It was in 2006 however that Nintendo came out with Wii. Wii games are played by combining the motion of a handheld remote controller and the use of the controller’s buttons to manipulate the on-screen player. And then there is Wii Fit that has games that incorporate yoga, strength training, balance and aerobics. The games are interactive and require the player to physically move, which is definitely much better than just sitting on the couch.
Nintendo Wii can be an effective tool to create or maintain a healthy lifestyle for some people because it follows the basic principles for adhering to an exercise program, like having physical activity goals, tracking those goals and evaluating the progress. Seniors today are leading better quality, activity-rich lives; therefore, they have become a more attractive consumer group. Many seniors were active athletes in their younger years, whether it was bowling, baseball, tennis etc. They are finding Wii to be an easy avenue for them to once again enjoy the activities of their younger years.
Many seniors are classifying Wii as addictive (in a good way), as well as fun and helpful in building muscles and using their entire bodies. Additionally, it’s becoming more and more popular in senior living communities. Although computers and technology can often times be confusing, Wii games/remotes are easy enough for most seniors to conquer and enjoy! So, I say “Get Your Wii On!”"
713,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/winter-driving-tips-for-aging-parents/,"As winter weather sweeps across the country, here are some ways to help keep senior drivers safe on the road. These tips can also help provide peace of mind to families out there who might be a little uneasy about their parents driving in the snow and ice.
HELP YOUR PARENTS WINTERIZE THEIR CAR
Ideally, you should help your aging parents winterize their car in the fall when the weather is still nice. But it’s not too late! A well-maintained car is essential to avoid unnecessary problems on wintry roads. Key things to check:
- The battery. Cold weather can be hard on a car’s battery.
- Make sure all tires are inflated properly.
- Car fluids. Antifreeze and windshield washer fluid should be checked and topped off.
- Windshield wipers. Good wiper blades are essential with all the salt and muck on the roads this time of year.
- Front and rear window defrosters. Make sure these are both working properly.
- Ice scraper. Check to make sure your parent’s car has an ice scraper/snow brush in the trunk.
ENCOURAGE YOUR PARENTS TO DRIVE DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS
Visibility is greatly reduced at dusk or dark. Have your aging parents plan their errands and trips during the day, if possible. If they are uncomfortable driving in winter weather, or at night, ask family members, neighbors or friends, to step in and help with transportation. Or you can consider hiring non-medical home care. FirstLight’s in-home companion caregivers can provide transportation services to help with errands and groceries, as well as help get your parents to doctor appointments and social events.
PREPARE A ROADSIDE EMERGENCY KIT
Put together a personalized emergency kit for your aging loved one that can be left in their car or trunk. It should include:
- A charger for their cell phone
- Extra set of warm clothing
- Blankets
- Flashlight
- Food and water
- Any must-have medications
PRACTICE. PRACTICE. PRACTICE.
This tip can be beneficial for everyone, not just seniors. The first time it snows, head over to a vacant parking lot and practice proper techniques for driving in snow and ice. Experiencing how your car reacts to slippery road conditions will help avoid issues and ill-prepared drivers on the road.
WATCH THE FORECAST
Stay up on what your local meteorologist is saying about the three- to five-day forecast and plan accordingly. If cold, snow, ice, and potential poor driving conditions are in the forecast, encourage your parents to adjust their schedule to avoid having to drive when the roads could potentially be hazardous.
Winter weather driving can be tricky for anyone, at any age. Unfortunately, some aging seniors also must deal with poor vision, limited mobility and slower response times. So, if the weather outside is frightful, and the driving conditions are unsafe, you should encourage your parents to stay home and off the roads. And if your aging loved one needs assistance around their home during inclement weather, including transportation or other in-home care to help them survive the winter, contact us today to see how we can help.

714,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/winter-safety-tips-for-seniors/,"Depending on where you live, the weather outside can get pretty frightful during the winter months. Plunging temperatures, snow and ice can pose problems both indoors and out, and older adults are at a higher risk for injuries and other weather-related health issues. You can minimize cold-weather dangers simply by being prepared. All it takes is a little planning and attention to your surroundings. Following are some tips – for seniors and for everyone – for staying safe this winter.
Falls
Seniors are more prone to injury from a slip or fall. In fact, the National Safety Council reports that falls are the leading cause of injury-related death for adults ages 65 and older. Snow and ice can compound the problem, making even a simple walk to the mailbox treacherous. The best protection is to stay indoors when sidewalks and roads are covered in winter white. But if you must venture out, be sure to wear shoes or boots with good traction. Stay on walkways that have been cleared and treated with salt, and use handrails or a cane for added stability. When you return inside, remove shoes right away to prevent melted snow and ice from being tracked throughout the house and creating slippery conditions inside.
Snow Shoveling
Shoveling snow is a job everyone loves to hate. And for older adults, it may be a job best left to someone else. Data from the Cleveland Clinic show that shoveling snow sends more than 11,000 people to the hospital each year. For many, shoveling can cause orthopedic injury. For others, it can trigger a heart attack.
Shoveling wet, heavy snow can put unnecessary strain on your heart, forcing it to work harder to keep you warm. And if you have problems with balance or osteoporosis, shoveling can be especially hazardous. Don’t hesitate to enlist help. If you must shovel, work in short shifts, don’t overload the shovel and dress in warm layers to protect yourself from the elements.
Hypothermia and Frostbite
Frigid temperatures can be more than unbearable – they can be downright dangerous. It goes without saying that if you’re going to be outside for an extended period of time, you need to be warmly dressed — heavy coat, hat, gloves, scarf, warm socks and boots. Without the proper attire, you risk frostbite to exposed skin and an unsafe drop in body temperature, known as hypothermia, which can result in death. Older adults are at a higher risk of hypothermia due to changes that happen as your body ages. Your best bet is to stay indoors, don’t let the inside temperature of your home dip too low (keep at 65 degrees or warmer) and limit outside exposure to short trips.
Winter Driving
When it comes to winter driving, it’s a good idea to follow the Boy Scout motto: Be prepared. Have your vehicle serviced and winterized so it’s ready for less-than-optimal driving conditions. Be sure to check the oil, antifreeze, tires, battery and wipers. If you have snow tires, get them into the rotation. Assemble an emergency kit to keep in your trunk with a few basic supplies: blankets, jumper cables, windshield scraper, small shovel, rock salt or cat litter (for tire traction if you get stuck), water and non-perishable food, flashlight and first aid kit. If you must drive in winter weather, be especially careful on overpasses, bridges and ramps, which tend to freeze before roads. Consider taking an alternate route to avoid roads that aren’t well-traveled or cleared. Always take your cellphone so you can reach out for help in case of an emergency.
Home Heating
The best place to be on a cold, snowy day is in the warm comfort of your own home. Older adults come from a generation that’s familiar with and often prefers the use of alternate heat sources, such as fireplaces, gas heaters and wood stoves. But these sources can be hazardous if not safely managed. According to the U.S. Fire Administration, heating is the second-leading cause of house fires, trailing only cooking. Fires confined to chimneys, flues or fuel burners account for 84 percent of home heating fires.
Before you fire up your heating devices for the season, make sure they’re properly maintained, cleaned and vented. If not, you run the risk of exposure to carbon monoxide, a deadly gas that you can’t see or smell. Make sure you have both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors in your home, and test the batteries frequently. If you’re using a space heater, be sure to keep it at least three feet away from anything that can burn (curtains, rugs, bedding, furniture, etc.).
Helping fight Old Man Winter.
The best tip for staying safe during the cold winter months is to ask for help when you need it. Whether it’s assistance with snow removal, a ride to the grocery store or doctor’s appointment, or help arranging a service technician for your car or home heating device, you don’t have to tackle these tasks on your own. FirstLight can help. With awareness and pre-planning, seniors can safely maintain their independence at home, no matter what challenges Old Man Winter throws their way."
715,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/winter-safety/,"Well, it’s certain that winter is here and in most states across the country, we have the weather to prove it! Along with freezing temps come snow and icy walkways, which can be extremely dangerous for our elderly friends and family members. Though falls can and do happen in the home as well, it’s important to be extra careful outdoors this time of year. Here are a few tips for fall prevention:
It’s shoe time! Make sure footwear is suitable for winter weather. Check the traction and fit. Consider anti-slip overshoes or use non-slip treads on your existing shoes. Also, lined boots with good traction will keep you safe and warm.
The salt of the Earth. It’s important to keep salt inside your house so that you can sprinkle it on walkways without having to risk a fall outside to get it. Make sure the sidewalk, driveway, front walk and front step are salted.
Hold on for dear life. Take advantage of railings and loved one’s elbows when offered. This will keep you more stable as you make your way up and down stairs. Don’t be afraid to ask for an elbow when it’s needed, better safe than sorry!
Slow your roll. Hurrying when leaving your home, getting on and off the bus, crossing the street or unloading your car can put you at risk of falling. Take your time and pay attention to steps, curbs, ramps and patches of ice.
Strengthen your legs. Exercise is one of the most important things you can do for fall prevention. Simple moves done in the home, even from a sitting position, will help build muscle and keep you steadier so you don’t lose your balance.
Stay warm and have a great weekend!"

New data is giving us a clearer picture of the impact of caregiving on work-life balance, as well as employee productivity and performance. Let’s review that data, and explore opportunities for family caregivers to get more support during their 9-to-5.
Working family caregivers are in good company.
An estimated one-fifth of today’s working Americans are also family caregivers, which means they are, in essence, juggling two jobs: a paid career and an unpaid labor of love. The stress of this balancing act is real. Working caregivers don’t want to let anyone down – not at work or at home. According to the AARP Public Policy Institute, 69 percent of working caregivers report having to change their work schedules, decrease their hours or take unpaid leave to meet their caregiving duties. Managing two demanding roles can take a toll on working caregivers, putting a strain on their emotional and physical health and their financial well-being. Not to mention the consequences for their employers in terms of lost productivity.
The data about the impact of the dual role is compelling.
A joint study by the National Alliance for Caregiving and AARP revealed the impact of family caregiving on work. Survey respondents reported the following effects of their caregiving roles on their jobs:
- 49% regularly go in late, leave early and/or take time off
- 15% take a leave of absence
- 14% reduce hours or take less-demanding positions
- 7% receive a warning about performance/attendance
- 6% give up work entirely
- 5% turn down promotions
- 4% retire early
- 3% lose job benefits
Choices for family caregivers aren’t easy.
When work requirements conflict with caregiving tasks, the family caregiver is forced to make a choice. Family often wins out, and the employer can face significant losses. Statistics show employers lose tens of billions of dollars each year due to absenteeism, reduced work hours, workday interruptions, costs associated with replacing employees who’ve left jobs due to caregiving, and increased healthcare costs due to caregiving’s physical and emotional toll.
Employees, too, face impacts from these concessions, which can derail their careers, affect their earning potential and diminish their financial outlook. It’s clear employers must consider ways to help employees be more productive by supporting better balance of work and caregiving responsibilities. Employers like Palo Alto Software, Pitney Bowes, Emory University, caring.com and pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Astellas are beginning to do just that.
Collaborating with employers can make a difference.
Family caregivers can take action to influence these issues.
- Start a conversation. Employers can’t help working caregivers if they don’t understand their needs. Reinforce your continued commitment to your work, but be upfront about your caregiving situation. Increased awareness and understanding of family caregiver challenges can improve the potential for better balance of responsibilities at work and at home.
- Develop a plan. If a family caregiving role is likely to be a long-term situation, consider proactively documenting a plan for how you can meet your work responsibilities, and how flexibility can help you remain productive.
- Engage human resources. Explore and consider all possible support options with your company’s human resources team. Alternative work schedules are becoming more commonplace, and can include flextime, compressed work hours, telecommuting and job sharing. Some companies are also beginning to offer benefits – often through Employee Assistance Programs – that can provide support or connect family caregivers with services like stress management programs, counseling, legal and financial assistance, respite care and support groups.
- Recommend programs. Influential organizations are spearheading efforts to support working family caregivers. Urge your company to get involved in programs like the new partnership between AARP, the National Alliance for Caregiving and Pfizer. Their Respect A Caregiver’s Time – or ReACT – program provides educational resources, online tools and research to help managers and human resources executives take action to support employee caregivers.
- Organize a support group. With 20 percent of the workforce playing the dual role of employee and family caregiver, chances are you have coworkers who share your challenges. Consider connecting with them through a support group, network or other collaborative activity.
- Know your rights. If your caregiving responsibilities require you to step away from your job – even temporarily – understand your rights. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) may apply to your situation. Typically, employers with 50 or more employees must comply with FMLA, which entitles eligible workers to 12 weeks per year of unpaid leave for family caregiving. Taking this leave would not impact your health insurance coverage or job security. More information can be found on the U.S. Department of Labor’s website.
- Be aware of public policy. President-Elect Donald Trump highlights the needs of family caregivers in his plan for the first 100 days of his administration. Specifically, his “Contract with the American Voter” proposes the Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act, which would allow for tax deductions for eldercare expenses and create tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for elderly dependents.
While the task of juggling work and family caregiving can be overwhelming, there are resources that can help provide a better balance. Working caregivers shouldn’t have to feel like they are going it alone. The help you need is out there.

719,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/working-later-in-life/,"This year there are over seven million workers aged 65 and older. Just 15 years ago, that number was half of what it is today. With a struggling economy, many workers are losing their jobs close to retirement age and looking for new careers to start later in life. Other reasons for postponing retirement range far and wide, but include people who aren’t emotionally ready for retirement, those who feel an economic responsibility to contribute, longer and healthier life spans, or financial concerns.
An increasing number of older workers are also part of the “sandwich generation,” providing care for their kids and aging parents. This financial stress pushes some older workers to take second jobs, work later in life or to start their own businesses to maintain some scheduling freedom for family and hobbies.
Some positions people are looking at during these later-in-life transitions include:
- Retail jobs
- Opening a franchise
- Freelance positions
- Hobbies turned professions
- Volunteer positions using past professional skills
One option for older workers is entrepreneurship in the form of franchising. Many older workers enjoy the flexibility of running their own businesses and choosing a concept that they enjoy. Here at FirstLight Home Care, several of our franchisees are approaching or past traditional retirement age."
720,https://www.firstlighthomecare.com/blog/your-teeth-and-gums-can-impact-your-health/,"October is Dental Hygiene Month (sorry, no cake or sweets with this celebration). Taking care of your teeth and gums can have great health benefits. Here are a few of our favorite facts:
- Boosts Your Self-esteem and Confidence: Decayed teeth and gum disease are often associated not only with an unsightly mouth but very bad breath – which, let’s be honest, affects your confidence, self-image, and self-esteem.
- May Lower Risk of Heart Disease: Chronic inflammation from gum disease has been associated with the development of cardiovascular problems such as heart disease, blockages of blood vessels, and strokes.
- Preserves Your Memory: Adults with gingivitis (swollen, bleeding gums) performed worse on tests of memory and other cognitive skills than did those with healthier gums and mouths, according to a report in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry.
- Reduces Risks of Infection and Inflammation in Your Body: Poor oral health has been linked with the development of infection in other parts of the body.
Research has found an association between gum disease and rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation of the joints. Experts say the mechanism of the destruction of connective tissues in both gum disease and RA is similar.
Eating a balanced diet, seeing your dentist regularly, and good oral hygiene helps reduce your risks of tooth decay and gum disease. Make sure you brush twice a day and floss once a day."
