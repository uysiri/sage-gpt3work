Yoro is more than just your typical functional beverage. More than just a drink filled with antioxidants and adaptogens. Yoro was explicitly crafted to help you tap into your specific need-state. No artificial flavors. All-Natural.
You're probably asking yourself, ""What exactly is a need-state? For the sake of simplicity, Yoro allows you to pursue a feeling. We're interrupting the routine of people just dragging through the day and feeling out of control rather than tapping into their mood. How you're starting your day, how you're getting through it, and how you end it. When you pick up a can, you're choosing your state of being.
Never ride the wave. Be the wave.

After undergoing a spiritual awakening during wine harvest in California in 2016, CEO, Robert Haynes made a pilgrimage to Gifu, Japan to signify the start of his new life. He was adviser by his mentor and kickboxing coach to visit, where he experienced Yoro Falls’ mystic healing abilities himself. Haynes wanted to share the same feeling with the world and empower them to adapt to the ebbs and flows of everyday life by Being The Wave.

About Yoro
What are the varieties of Yoro?
Two delicious flavors: Guava Passionfruit and Pineapple Ginger, made with all-natural ingredients and premium plant extracts. We’re working around the clock on other flavors to launch later! If you have any ideas or flavors you’d like to see in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out!
What is the shelf life of Yoro?
Unopened, each can last up to 12 months depending on whether or not they’ve been stored properly at room temperature. Please reference the expiry date on the bottom of your can.
I want to sell Yoro at my business. Do you have a wholesale program?
Yes. Email us at wholesale@drinkyoro.com with the following information and we will get in touch with you promptly: Contact name, name of the business, address of the business, phone number, and email address.
Where can I purchase Yoro?
As of now, right here on our website. We plan to roll out to select retailers across the country over the next few months.
Do I need to be 21 years of age to drink Yoro?
The short answer is no. While we encourage people of all ages (excluding babies and young children) to enjoy our drinks, we suggest speaking with your physician if you have any concerns.
Ingredients and Nutritional Information
Is Yoro all natural?
Yes, we use just a few simple ingredients. Yoro doesn’t contain any artificial ingredients, nor any preservatives!
What are natural flavors?
A blend of tastes and flavoring constituents derived from all natural products that provide Yoro’s distinct taste and character. Yoro contains no artificial flavors, dyes or synthetic ingredients.
Why do you use natural flavors?
Artificial flavors are made from non-food sources. By using natural flavors, we are able to source consumable elements found in nature that are essential for health and wellness.
What don’t you include in Yoro beverages?
No added sugar. No dairy. No gluten. No soy. No artificial flavors, colors, preservatives, or fillers. In summary, we do our best to keep out all of the bad stuff.
How much sugar is in Yoro?
There’s only one gram of sugar in each 12oz serving of Yoro, so you can drink away without feeling any guilt. Many functional beverages including energy drinks are loaded with added sugars and other harmful ingredients that aren’t good for your overall well-being.
How many calories are in a serving?
Fortunately, there are only 15 calories in each 12oz can of Yoro. The great taste is there, but without the caloric impact, that one would normally expect from similar drinks that pack a lot of flavor.
Does Yoro need to be refrigerated?
While we think Yoro tastes great over ice or fresh out the fridge, this is simply our personal preference. If not stored in the fridge, keep your product in a cool, dry place. Try to keep away direct sunlight or extreme heat such as hot cars.
How long can I enjoy Yoro after opening?
Yoro is carbonated so it will eventually lose its fizz after being opened for a period of time. We do recommend drinking it right away once opened, but you can refrigerate it and it will stay good for up to 5 days in a closed container. Our spidey senses tell us that it won’t be too long before you’re drinking another one.
What are adaptogens?
Natural substances, usually in the form of an herb or nutrient, that helps the body adapt to various stressors. Adaptogens stimulate immunity and help the body provide resistance to diseases.
When should I drink Yoro?
Whether you’re on the road traveling, studying for an exam, at work, hanging with friends, or staying in to pair with a cocktail of your choice - we think Yoro is perfect for almost any occasion.
Shipping
Do you offer free shipping?
Yes, on all orders over $100.
When will my order arrive?
We do our best to ensure that in-stock orders are shipped out the next business day. Once your order leaves the facility, you can expect your delivery within 3-5 business days.
How do I track my order?
As soon as your order ships, we’ll send you a shipping confirmation email with your UPS tracking ID number. If you have an account with us, you can also find your tracking ID number in the Order History section of My Account.
You can click on the link in your shipping confirmation email, or copy and paste your tracking ID number into the UPS Tracking Page to locate your package.
Shipping to a PO box? Copy and paste your tracking ID number into the USPS Tracking Page.
