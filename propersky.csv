How to Ensure Your Computer is Safe
There is no 100% foolproof way to ensure that your internet connected computer is safe from threats. However there are 5 common sense steps every computer user can take to protect themselves from typical threats.
- It starts with security updates. PC, Mac, Android, whatever. No matter what your operating system, anything from the manufacturer with the word “security” in the title should be downloaded and installed. For windows users, this is EXTREMELY important. This is your single best defense against malware.
- Don’t forget about your apps! Flash, Java, Chrome, Firefox, and Acrobat are also places you can get attacked. Keep ’em updated. Watch out for the checkboxes though!
- Get Good Antivirus. For most users MalwareBytes and ESET are a great place to start. Don’t let robot images fool you, these are good products and well worth the money.
- Trust, but Verify. Did your Uncle Kevin really travel to Belgrade and suddenly need $10,000? Does your daughter routinely send emails that need a password to open them? If the answer is probably not, then you probably should not open those emails. You carry the entire internet in your pocket! Text, facebook or call before you open.
- Get good Backup. We use a tightly integrated, custom cloud solution for our customers but there are some great products out there that are worth it. Crashplan, Carbonite and iDrive are well regarded. Everyone forgets about their photos and files until their gone.
There are many more, but we consider these our bases We start with OS security updates, followed by 3rd party updates, then good AV, user verification and finally backup. These 5 things make your computer and browsing much, much safer.

https://propersky.com/5-signs-your-philadelphia-business-needs-an-outsourced-it-services-company/,"5 Signs Your Philadelphia Business Needs an Outsourced IT Services Company
All types of businesses in Philadelphia benefit from having dedicated IT resources and personnel on staff to ensure they can operate efficiently without being over-burdened by technical issues. Without dedicated IT resources in place, companies can suffer and experience reduced productivity, limited efficiency and increased downtime. However, hiring an in-house IT team can be costly, time-consuming and unnecessary.
So what can a business do to then? How can they get the support they need without all the overhead?
That is why many businesses choose to outsource their IT needs to a Managed IT Service Provider. This gives them the benefit from having expert IT personnel on hand whenever they need them, without incurring the on-going costs of hiring IT staff. Furthermore, using an established IT service company enables businesses to benefit from a wide-range of expertise and specializations, and will ensure that the business receives the breadth of professional IT services it requires. The key takeaway here is that they can acquire all these benefits for less than the cost of just one salaried employee.
If you’re still unsure whether you need help from IT professionals, these five signs may highlight the importance of having dedicated IT service providers in place…
1. You don’t have a cybersecurity plan
You wouldn’t leave your physical premises unlocked and unmanned, so why take the risk with your company’s digital assets? Cybersecurity should be a top priority for business executives, and your business needs to have effective security measures in place.
Cybersecurity threats come in many forms, so it’s vital to obtain professional advice and assistance when you’re devising an appropriate security strategy. Ransomware, malware, viruses, and phishing are common examples of cybersecurity threats faced by businesses, but more are being developed all the time.
If your IT network is affected by an online security threat, it can bring your business to a standstill. If your hardware is rendered unusable, for example, you won’t be able to process orders, update your inventory, communicate with clients or even liaise with colleagues in your own office. If your manufacturing or service deliveries are automated, these may come to an abrupt stop too.
Furthermore, online security threats can cause reputational damage, which could harm your business in the long-term. If a cybersecurity issue becomes public, customers and clients may lose trust in your brand and it can be difficult for businesses to recover from this.
In addition to this, you need to consider the legal implications of a breach of cybersecurity. With increasing legislation and regulations regarding the safe storage and processing of data, companies are being held to account when security breaches result in someone unauthorized gaining access to your company information and customer data.
With so many risks associated with cybersecurity, it’s essential that all businesses utilize Philadelphia IT services and implement effective security measures. In addition to creating and enforcing a dedicated security strategy for your company, outsourced IT specialists can respond to any cybersecurity threats as they emerge and ensure that they are stopped before any damage occurs. This ensures that your company’s operations and brand aren’t in jeopardy and enables you to continue functioning. In addition to this, utilizing outsourced IT services ensures your cybersecurity strategy can be updated to respond to emerging threats as and when they happen.
2. You’re spending time troubleshooting
When things go wrong with your IT hardware or software, you may spend an inordinate amount of time trying to get things back up and running. Whether your hosting provider has let you down, you’ve spilled a drink on your laptop, or your CRM system is failing to save new entries, any IT issues need to be resolved quickly and efficiently. With remote access to your network, IT specialists can resolve many issues via a single phone call, but an IT Services Provider in Philadelphia can also be on-site quickly to resolve more in-depth problems.
Unfortunately, many business owners assume that troubleshooting their own IT problems saves them money, but the reverse is often true. While you’re busy trying to resolve an IT issue, you aren’t able to focus on your core business areas. Depending on the issue you’re facing, business operations may be delayed until the problem is fixed, and this will cost you a significant amount in reduced productivity.
Indeed, businesses with more than one employee can suffer additional setbacks if multiple members of staff are attempted to troubleshoot IT issues. Without the intricate knowledge and expertise required, staff could inadvertently cause further damage to your IT systems. As well as damaging your network, this could also result in gaps in your security systems and may potentially leave your network vulnerable to hackers, ransomware or viruses.
While attempting to troubleshoot your own IT problems will inevitably cost you money in terms of reduced efficiency and productivity, it could lead to further losses if additional damage or vulnerability occurs.
By ensuring you have access to dedicated professionals, however, you can rely on them to resolve any IT problems quickly and comprehensively. Enabling you to focus on your core business areas and ensuring your systems are up and running swiftly, an outsourced IT service provider can save your company a significant amount in both the short and long-term.
3. You already have an IT employee
Companies often assume that hiring an IT professional will ensure they have all the IT support that they require. However, the vast majority of businesses require more than what one employee can realistically offer. While you may have a talented IT professional already on the payroll, if they’re overwhelmed and overworked, you could risk losing them completely.
In addition to this, IT is a growing industry and there are various different specializations. Your current IT personnel may have in-depth knowledge of cloud server management, for example, but may be unfamiliar with cybersecurity protocols. Similarly, your IT technician may be excellent at resolving hardware issues, but may not have experience in managing cloud-based integrations.
While an in-house member on staff who is dedicated to IT can certainly be advantageous for businesses, it doesn’t necessarily mean that they don’t require additional support. By supplementing your internal IT staff and using the services of an IT service provider, you can ensure that your existing members of staff have access to extra support when they need it. As a result, your company will benefit from the expertise of a range of IT professionals and be able to utilize a far wider range of tech.
4. Your business is growing
As your business evolves, your IT infrastructure needs to grow too. Start-ups and enterprises often begin with minimal IT resources, but this changes fairly quickly as they begin to establish themselves. Similarly, small and medium-sized businesses can only expand into larger companies if they have the IT systems to facilitate it.
When designed properly, an IT network can scale as your business grows. Without the right IT infrastructure, it may be impossible for your business to expand. As a result, you may only obtain a limited market share, be unable to expand your services and you could even lose clients and customers to competitors with additional resources.
When you rely on outsourced IT services, however, you can ensure that you have the appropriate infrastructure for your business. As well as ensure that your existing network and systems are suitable for your business now, dedicated IT experts can determine whether they are suitable for the business growth you’re aiming for and, if not, what modifications will need to be made.
Upgrading your IT network as your business grows opens up new opportunities and it can help your company to increase its revenue too. Companies which try to function with limited resources typically end up bringing in less revenue, so relying on a network which doesn’t meet your needs isn’t going to be cost-effective.
In addition to this, a growing business typically requires more support from IT professionals and technicians. As you become increasingly reliant on your tech infrastructure, you’ll require additional resources in terms of data storage, additional user privileges, new employee accounts, and problem resolution. Hiring in-house IT staff to manage these issues can be costly, but outsourcing your needs to a dedicated IT service provider enables you to access this support as soon as you need it for one low monthly rate.
With budget-friendly options to suit businesses of all sizes, outsourcing your IT needs gives you the flexibility you need as a growing business. Whether you’re moving from a sole proprietor to an incorporated company or a medium-sized enterprise to a national corporation, scalable IT support is crucial to your success.
5. You don’t have an IT strategy
Although IT is integral to almost every organization out there, a significant number of companies don’t have an IT strategy in place. While they rely on their IT systems and networks every day, businesses don’t always take a proactive approach when it comes to the impact their existing infrastructure has on their business operations.
Of course, there are thousands of IT products, platforms and tools available and keeping up-to-date can be a hard task. With many products claiming to offer increased productivity, streamlined processes and enhanced efficiency, how do you know which ones really deliver?
Here’s where professional IT experts come into play. With an in-depth knowledge of the industry, IT technicians are well-placed to determine which platforms and what software can help to improve your business functions. If you want to automate your e-commerce, for example, an experienced IT professional can help you to determine which platform is right for your business.
Technology is constantly being updated and improved and using the latest tools can ensure your business is operating at its maximum capabilities. In addition to this, by using the right tech options, you can engage with potential new clients and customers in a whole new way. This enables your business to market your goods and services more effectively and can lead to increased sales and profit.
However, these opportunities all begin with your IT strategy. Identifying how your IT can propel your business forward is critical to your on-going success and business growth. As your competitors switch to newer and more efficient tech, you could risk losing your customer base if you don’t keep up.
Outsourced IT companies are an ideal way to access the information and expertise you need to build a solid IT strategy. With a range of different specialties, outsourced IT professionals have the capability to identify appropriate IT solutions for your business needs, regardless of your sector or industry. Whatever your business goals are, IT professionals have the inside knowledge to ensure you can achieve them.
Perhaps you want to increase automation or streamline internal processes? Maybe you want to introduce new e-commerce options? You might be eager to reduce your costs by digitizing your inventory and restocking processes?
Instead of wading through thousands of IT products and trying to determine which ones are right for your company, an experienced IT service provider can provide you with the information you need instantly. Furthermore, when you consult an IT professional, they will be able to confirm which tools, services, and systems can be integrated into your existing tech set-up, which can save you time and money.
Whenever a company introduces new tech solutions, there can be some initial teething problems. As staff become accustomed to the new system, there may be an increased need for troubleshooting, for example. Engaging with an IT service provider doesn’t just help to ensure you have the right IT strategy in place, it also ensures that you have the resources you need as you implement this strategy.
When it’s time to install new systems, upgrade your hardware or train staff in new IT protocols, your outsourced IT provider will be able to offer the additional support you require. As a constant background presence, you can rely on outsourced IT services to step forward as and when they’re needed. Giving you IT support on a day-to-day basis and ensuring you have a forward-thinking IT strategy in place, an outsourced IT service provider will help to keep your business functional, as well as profitable.

https://propersky.com/6-types-of-managed-it-services-and-their-uses/,"6 Types of Managed IT Services and Their Uses
[9 min read]
Contemporary startups, small and medium businesses, and even large corporations see the value and potential of managed IT services. However, it can be challenging to identify what services you and your business may need, which systems you can use creatively within your company, and which operations you are better off keeping in-house.
Based on your managed service provider (MSP) and their services, you may want to explore different options and subscription packages. Find out which MSPs offer the services you need and how much those managed IT services cost. Usually, an MSPs managed IT service model allows you to choose which services to outsource based on your current technology and systems.
Check out our articles to help identify which managed IT solutions your business may benefit from and how to choose a fitting managed service provider. The articles can also help you recognize why you should use a managed service provider, which IT services you should manage versus keeping in-house.
To help you and your business begin managing your IT services, we’ve compiled six primary managed IT service categories and how companies use them.
While you can break down the types of managed IT services in various ways, we’ve categorized them by hardware and software.
Managed Networking
Typically, businesses with high-performance, secure, and traffic-heavy hosting and storage services will manage these services to avoid the costs of supporting data centers. Organizations with extensive cloud computing demands, dozens of web servers, or a need for massive databases will see particularly effective results managing networking tasks.
Additionally, startups and medium businesses using Wide Area Networks (WANs), Local-Area Networks (LANs), or Metropolitan Area Network (MANs) will contract with MSPs under a Service Level Agreement (SLA). This way, MSPs will manage the gateways, automated network support, and maintenance of operating these large networks.
On top of reducing work, managed wireless networks also reduce the ownership costs of supporting area networks. Ask yourself, “what managed network services do I need?” and see how your MSP can fulfill your requirements.
Managed Hardware
When businesses utilize offices for team members or plan on scaling into large work complexes, MSPs take a lot of the strain off such a transition. Desktops, servers, storage, user profiles, virtual administrative systems, and all the maintenance needed to run everything can cost SMBs time resources that they don’t have. On top of setting everything up, maintaining and monitoring the health of users’ systems is a whole operation of itself.
If organizations don’t have the talent to sustain strenuous IT hardware tasks, outsourcing the work to licensed professionals saves everyone headache. The last thing businesses need is their entire system to crash as they are stress-testing their servers for investors.
Managed Security
Passing on IT security to MSPs is one of the most common workloads we see in the world of managed IT services. When it comes to consumer data, businesses should implement every cybersecurity layer possible.
Network security involves arduous yet critical analyses of your business network, machines, and users to detect anything from suspicious activity to unintentional virus access points that could compromise your data and business. If organizations can’t commit the proper resources to ensure their network is secure, then contracting MSP security solutions is the safest and most ethical option.
MSPs can schedule data backups, monitor and control backup hardware, test backup restores, and create proactive ransomware and malware solutions. Hackers often prey on smaller businesses attempting to save money on their cybersecurity budget. Malicious internet pirates can nest themselves into a server for years without anyone noticing.
Managed firewalls are also an excellent way for businesses to outsource their cybersecurity while monitoring status reports and updating their hardware and software when needed. MSPs commonly include bundles of anti-hacker and security infrastructure management services into one package, allowing businesses to evaluate their security needs quickly.
Managed customer support services
Customer support services, also known as end-user services, include various IT assistance forms, like troubleshooting or remediating technical issues, providing IT helpdesks, and even labor addressing in-person issues.
End-user services can cover dozens of services. However, businesses typically opt for in-house IT support and assistance channels.
IT service desks, on-demand trained agents, and live monitoring and control solutions are more than enough for most businesses. This combination of services encompasses issues like mobile device support, operating system installation, software installation and updates, connectivity errors, and more.
While more established corporations may keep many customer support services in-house, it can be challenging for SMBs to provide support for the variety of It issues they may encounter. Using MSPs allows your IT teams to focus on more critical projects.
Information systems consulting
In some situations, designated experts can work internal to your organization, providing regular IT leadership, consultations, and advising. These professionals can help you plan out technological implementation strategies to ensure maximum ROI and effective execution.
MSPs providing consultations is rare, and most of the time, service providers sell them separately. However, for businesses without experienced talent or those in need of guidance, IT consultations can be how your team finds the right path to accomplishing your goals.
Managed cloud infrastructure
Today, we see more organizations utilizing cloud solutions than ever. Virtual apps, services, software, operating systems, and servers have unprecedented potential. After implementing cloud technology, a company’s limiting factor becomes a team’s creativity rather than technology.
Cloud and data management services are also becoming necessary for businesses creating increasingly ambitious products in a highly competitive IT market. Cloud-based resources allow organizations to accommodate scaling services and easily modify products for consumers.
In addition to providing innovative solutions to customers, employees can also enjoy the benefits of cloud technology. On-demand, web-based managed application services grant employees remote access to a company’s network and resources anywhere they go. Companies that use cloud-based web services often see increases in productivity as their employees have increased flexibility.
Managed cloud service providers will often supply and overwatch servers. These cloud servers also serve as backup and recovery data centers. Not only do these tools improve your IT security, but they also reduce your IT budget and create actual, predictable costs for extensive and developed cloud infrastructure.
Managed infrastructure can be one of the most powerful tools your business ever employs. We highly recommend analyzing your business needs and determining how you can incorporate cloud tools into your business model.
Some view outsourcing and managing IT services as an escape from developing as a business. However, managed service providers can be the ticket your business needs to succeed.
Small and medium businesses commonly benefit from the managed services provider business model. As your business scales, you can dynamically adjust which services you outsource and keep in-house.
Managed technology services complement business growth and provide your team with much-needed breathing room or your budget with the overhead it needs to stabilize. We highly encourage researching various remote managed services and even cloud security services to take your business to the next level.

https://propersky.com/about/our-values/,"Every business is driven by certain principles. These are at Proper Sky’s core:
When Proper Sky launched back in April of 2006, we promised ourselves our company would be different. Every day, we work our hardest to do what’s right; for our solutions to be practical; to not only be technology experts, but to be genuinely nice to our customers; and, above all, to learn and grow as a team."
https://propersky.com/about/what-is-a-proper-sky/,"Where Did the Name “Proper Sky” Come From?
This is the question we get asked more than any other. After our CEO, Jim Smith, finished with the Peace Corps in 2006, he returned to the U.S. obsessed with the idea of starting his own business. But as many perfectionists know, naming a business is no small procedure. Whenever Jim felt he had something awe-inspiring, he’d search the US Patent Office, US Trademarks Office (whose site hasn’t been updated in at least 12 years) and NameCheap, but was left disappointed each time. It seemed all the favorable names had been claimed.
After a few frustrating days, inspiration finally struck in the form of building a digital name generator. Jim lifted various words from the dictionary, compiled them, and let the script couple words together. Once a catalog of potential names had been built, Jim checked to see if anybody owned the domains for his favorites. When the domain hadn’t been taken, he forwarded the top generated names to close friends and family for feedback.
This, however, is only a brief explanation of how Jim came up with ‘Proper Sky’. The more technological (but far more interesting) version of this story is detailed below.
Business Name Generator 1.0
Back in 2006, Jim was heavily invested in Linux and decided to write a simple Perl script to carry out his work for him. He established a 3-step criteria:
- The .com domain had to be available and financially viable.
- The name itself had to be eye-catching.
- The name also had to be fewer than 15 characters.
The first condition was simple to abide by: Jim ran the ‘whois’ command and looked for ‘No match for’. It was near enough fool-proof.
The second condition, however, presented a more interesting challenge. Most of the shorter words had already been registered by a company or an organization, so instead of looking for a single word at a time, Jim searched for two combined words instead. The search took two disparate words ($w) and ($x) from the dictionary. Once the results poured in, Jim combed through to see if $w and $x were available as .com domains. When they weren’t free, he created two entirely new variables: $y & $z, where ($y = $w + $x) and ($z = $x + $w). Ultimately, it looked something like this:
$w = chowder
$x = yummy
$y = chowderyummy
$z = yummychowder
If the letter count was fewer than 15 characters (as to follow rule 3), Jim added a ‘.com’ at the end to see if the name in question had been claimed. Eventually, all of the steps added up to a business name being generated, and an effective business name generator being created in the process.
After Jim had let the script run for a few hours, he took the generated names and culled the list down to the 10 hardest hitters. The next morning, Jim picked out the 6 names below and made logos for each of them. A Philly theme might be noticeable.
After compiling the list and making individual logos for each name, one undeniably stood out. Proper Sky – as a name and concept – truly resonated. It was emblematic of the way Jim Smith felt about technology: wide open but with fundamental rules and constructs. And on 4/11/2006, the name Proper Sky was officially registered."

Hosted desktop and server solutions
Cloud workspaces deliver the right data, at the right time, to the right people. Working from the cloud puts you at the digital helm of your organization, with complete control over access, rights, privileges, and more.

We provide comprehensive EHR and EMR support and consulting services in Abington, PA. Our expert EHR and EMR consultants can help you select the best solution for your practice or if you already have an EHR/EMR package, we can help you get the most out of it.
By taking a simple approach that works with your enterprise’s needs, we review:
Helping you understand your technology investment
Before making a purchase, you have to consider several factors to ensure it’s worth your while. Though the questions you’ll ask yourself may seem simple, they quickly pile on. We’ll guide you every step of the way, before and after committing to an EHR.
Documenting essential information and training staff
EHR manuals often lack the practical information your staff needs in order to operate an EHR in a day-to-day environment. We specialize in training our clients’ teams to use a new EHR, so you can be confident your staff is using the technology correctly.
Determine your true data costs
When moving to a new EMR, you hope all of your data will be transferred. Sadly, this isn’t always the case. We can help you get the best amount of workable data possible from your legacy systems to your new systems, saving you time, money, and stress.
Turn data into insight
Analytics are crucial to business decisions, but EMR systems rarely come with the tools you need in order to understand your data. We’ll work with you to bring value to your data and give you the resources you need to make it meaningful.
By aligning the organizational goals of your enterprise, we can build a customized cybersecurity strategy that balances the latest threat intelligence and leading security practices with the factors that impact your at-risk information.

Measuring success in a practical way
Our partnership doesn’t end with implementation. We constantly measure our work’s impact, using data to determine the strategy’s success and identifying how we can improve it along the way.

When moving to a new EMR, you hope all of your data will be transferred. Sadly, this isn’t always the case. We can help you get the best amount of workable data possible from your legacy systems to your new systems, saving you time, money, and stress.
Turn data into insight
Analytics are crucial to business decisions, but EMR systems rarely come with the tools you need in order to understand your data. We’ll work with you to bring value to your data and give you the resources you need to make it meaningful.

While benefits of the cloud are ultimately dependent on your business, team size, and your mission, leveraging cloud services yields several benefits that are too good to ignore:
Email hosting via the cloud

Documenting essential information and training staff
EHR manuals often lack the practical information your staff needs in order to operate an EHR in a day-to-day environment. We specialize in training our clients’ teams to use a new EHR, so you can be confident your staff is using the technology correctly.
Determine your true data costs
When moving to a new EMR, you hope all of your data will be transferred. Sadly, this isn’t always the case. We can help you get the best amount of workable data possible from your legacy systems to your new systems, saving you time, money, and stress.
Turn data into insight
Analytics are crucial to business decisions, but EMR systems rarely come with the tools you need in order to understand your data. We’ll work with you to bring value to your data and give you the resources you need to make it meaningful.

https://propersky.com/areas-we-serve/plymouth-meeting-pa-cloud-services-support-consulting/,"What’s better than blue sky thinking? Cloud thinking.
Without a doubt, the future of tech revolves around cloud-based software — and there’s never been a better opportunity to take advantage of it than right now. We’re finally seeing the long-term advantages of huge enterprise cloud solutions trickling down to the small-to-mid-market companies. We provide cloud computing support and consulting services in Plymouth Meeting, PA. Our cloud consultants will help you identify the right solutions and help you integrate them into your business.
While benefits of the cloud are ultimately dependent on your business, team size, and your mission, leveraging cloud services yields several benefits that are too good to ignore:
Email hosting via the cloud
If you’re still hosting your own email server, we should talk. With Google Suite and Office 365, you’ll have access to secure tools that are always on and always available at a fraction of the cost of self-hosting.
Say goodbye to traditional telco circuits
Does your organization have a complicated setup of MPLS networks, hybrid VPN deployments or expensive, antiquated telco circuits? With cloud services, we can help you cut costs and streamline your setup.
Hosted desktop and server solutions
Cloud workspaces deliver the right data, at the right time, to the right people. Working from the cloud puts you at the digital helm of your organization, with complete control over access, rights, privileges, and more.
No data loss. Ever.
Hosting via the cloud means there’s a secure, real-time backup of your data all the time. It’s an end-to-end encrypted, 100% available enterprise solution accessible at a fraction of the cost when compared to competing models.
The way you work, at scale
Getting traction on just a single tweet could overwhelm your ecommerce system; the cloud presents ways for you to scale your business — in real time — when you need it, and back down when you don’t, so your system remains stable through traffic bursts.
We take a holistic approach to understanding your technology systems, ensuring you have the access and understanding you need in order to benefit from cloud services.

If your organization is evaluating an EMR or an EHR, you’re likely making the largest and most complicated technology commitment your organization will face. While EMR and EHR vendors promise everything, the delivery typically leaves much to be desired. Fortunately, fixing complicated, technical, and overwhelming issues is our specialty.
We provide comprehensive EHR and EMR support and consulting services in Plymouth Meeting, PA. Our expert EHR and EMR consultants can help you select the best solution for your practice or if you already have an EHR/EMR package, we can help you get the most out of it.
By taking a simple approach that works with your enterprise’s needs, we review:
Helping you understand your technology investment
Before making a purchase, you have to consider several factors to ensure it’s worth your while. Though the questions you’ll ask yourself may seem simple, they quickly pile on. We’ll guide you every step of the way, before and after committing to an EHR.
Documenting essential information and training staff
EHR manuals often lack the practical information your staff needs in order to operate an EHR in a day-to-day environment. We specialize in training our clients’ teams to use a new EHR, so you can be confident your staff is using the technology correctly.
Determine your true data costs
When moving to a new EMR, you hope all of your data will be transferred. Sadly, this isn’t always the case. We can help you get the best amount of workable data possible from your legacy systems to your new systems, saving you time, money, and stress.
Turn data into insight
Analytics are crucial to business decisions, but EMR systems rarely come with the tools you need in order to understand your data. We’ll work with you to bring value to your data and give you the resources you need to make it meaningful.
By aligning the organizational goals of your enterprise, we can build a customized cybersecurity strategy that balances the latest threat intelligence and leading security practices with the factors that impact your at-risk information.

Without a doubt, the future of tech revolves around cloud-based software — and there’s never been a better opportunity to take advantage of it than right now. We’re finally seeing the long-term advantages of huge enterprise cloud solutions trickling down to the small-to-mid-market companies. We provide cloud computing support and consulting services in Warminster, PA. Our cloud consultants will help you identify the right solutions and help you integrate them into your business.
While benefits of the cloud are ultimately dependent on your business, team size, and your mission, leveraging cloud services yields several benefits that are too good to ignore:
Email hosting via the cloud
If you’re still hosting your own email server, we should talk. With Google Suite and Office 365, you’ll have access to secure tools that are always on and always available at a fraction of the cost of self-hosting.
Say goodbye to traditional telco circuits
Does your organization have a complicated setup of MPLS networks, hybrid VPN deployments or expensive, antiquated telco circuits? With cloud services, we can help you cut costs and streamline your setup.
Hosted desktop and server solutions
Cloud workspaces deliver the right data, at the right time, to the right people. Working from the cloud puts you at the digital helm of your organization, with complete control over access, rights, privileges, and more.
No data loss. Ever.
Hosting via the cloud means there’s a secure, real-time backup of your data all the time. It’s an end-to-end encrypted, 100% available enterprise solution accessible at a fraction of the cost when compared to competing models.
The way you work, at scale

If your organization is evaluating an EMR or an EHR, you’re likely making the largest and most complicated technology commitment your organization will face. While EMR and EHR vendors promise everything, the delivery typically leaves much to be desired. Fortunately, fixing complicated, technical, and overwhelming issues is our specialty.
We provide comprehensive EHR and EMR support and consulting services in Warminster, PA. Our expert EHR and EMR consultants can help you select the best solution for your practice or if you already have an EHR/EMR package, we can help you get the most out of it.

Before making a purchase, you have to consider several factors to ensure it’s worth your while. Though the questions you’ll ask yourself may seem simple, they quickly pile on. We’ll guide you every step of the way, before and after committing to an EHR.
Documenting essential information and training staff
EHR manuals often lack the practical information your staff needs in order to operate an EHR in a day-to-day environment. We specialize in training our clients’ teams to use a new EHR, so you can be confident your staff is using the technology correctly.
Determine your true data costs
When moving to a new EMR, you hope all of your data will be transferred. Sadly, this isn’t always the case. We can help you get the best amount of workable data possible from your legacy systems to your new systems, saving you time, money, and stress.
Turn data into insight
Analytics are crucial to business decisions, but EMR systems rarely come with the tools you need in order to understand your data. We’ll work with you to bring value to your data and give you the resources you need to make it meaningful.
By aligning the organizational goals of your enterprise, we can build a customized cybersecurity strategy that balances the latest threat intelligence and leading security practices with the factors that impact your at-risk information.

https://propersky.com/benefits-of-using-a-local-it-services-provider-for-small-businesses/,"Why you should conduct a cybersecurity risk assessment for your business
[9 min read]
In the ever-evolving and increasingly popular fields of business and technology, upholding the best cybersecurity practices is paramount to ensure your customers, clients, or users aren’t exposed to the countless threats plaguing the internet. In addition to your customers’ virtual safety, businesses must remain vigilant against malicious hackers, bots, scripts, worms, and hundreds of simple yet devastating online attacks.
Cybersecurity risk assessments can help your businesses expose threats to your organization’s digital wellbeing and prioritize issues that may undermine your user’s privacy. The risk assessments are straightforward, lay the foundation for cybersecurity solutions, and may save your organization hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages in the future.
What is a cybersecurity risk assessment?
Typically, cybersecurity consultants schedule interviews with each of your company’s key members to analyze their policies, procedures, security measures, and daily practices. After compiling and analyzing the results, the consultant tailors a risk assessment to your business’s characteristics, factoring in team size, industry regulations and standards, projects, and technical literacy of your team.
Afterward, your IT staff works closely with the risk assessors to run through scenarios. They forecast vulnerabilities, the consequences they could have on your clients and organization, what practices the team should and shouldn’t be doing, as well as what tools your business can use to bolster its virtual security.
What is the purpose of IT & cybersecurity risk assessment?
Cybersecurity risk assessments help businesses emerge aware and ready to prevent cybersecurity risks. Your business’ IT staff should have the knowledge, resources, and ability to identify and prevent cybersecurity incidents, and having consultants, risk assessments, and periodic cybersecurity checks can save your business and customers.
Unfortunately, not all risk assessments are as simple as a checklist and an instruction manual. Especially in the cybersecurity realm, it can be difficult to quantify risks, and the threat issues pose to your business.
In most cases, cybersecurity consultants will combine their understanding of your business with their background in the modern security environment to help you create a plan of action against your most consequential security threats, IT vulnerabilities, and online practices.
Why do companies conduct cybersecurity risk assessments?
Usually, organizations conduct risk assessments before significant acquisitions, investments, changes with IT staff, when switching or adopting new technology, and periodically to keep up with the frighteningly rapid changes in the technological security space. Additionally, some industries so heavily rely on robust cybersecurity that organizations must conduct risk assessments to comply with laws and standards. Cybersecurity, healthcare, and finance are prime examples.
In most cases, IT management and support companies in the Philadelphia, Denver, and Pennsylvania areas will already incorporate risk management in their network security. Still, you can continually improve your company’s cybersecurity through managed IT services or risk assessments.
Benefits of Conducting a Cybersecurity Risk Assessment
Identify Cybersecurity & IT Vulnerabilities
Unlike speeding on the highway or walking alone in a bad neighborhood, the term “risk” has a different meaning in the cybersecurity world. Risk is the potential losses you face when a threat exploits a vulnerability.
Vulnerabilities like weak passwords introduce risks of unauthorized access and exposing confidential information. Companies can impose greater password requirements blacklist commonly used and easy-to-crack passwords to mitigate the risk of a password vulnerability.
While weak passwords are just one example of a vulnerability, everything from an email worm to a backdoor into your data centers are vulnerabilities that businesses must recognize. Each vulnerability poses a risk.
Whether your clients depend on you to ensure their data is safe or your employees entrust their company to protect their online presence, treat each vulnerability as if it were guaranteed to happen. Identify which mitigation strategies are best for the risk and your organization’s resources. Cybersecurity consultants and risks assessments help you do exactly that.
Professional cybersecurity reports and analyses
Cybersecurity risks can appear complicated, ambiguous, or too difficult to measure for new or small and medium businesses. Experts conduct cybersecurity risk assessments to create reports documenting your organization’s current security stature and relevant risks.
If you decide to conduct annual or regular cybersecurity risk assessments, your IT staff and cybersecurity team can quantitatively track your business’ progress as your team develops your security applications. Additionally, archiving regular risk assessments shows investors and clients that you actively invest in cybersecurity and care about everyone’s safety and information.
Available and tailored expertise
While cybersecurity assessment services provide you with valuable data, they represent a snippet of your company’s virtual security stature. For many businesses to reap the benefits of risk assessments, having involved and regular discussions with dedicated cybersecurity experts add exponentially more value to these assessments.
Cybersecurity risk assessments are results, not solutions. They provide businesses with a foundation to solve their vulnerabilities and account for risk. It’s up to you to create cybersecurity solutions; the risk assessment is merely a tool to achieve that.
Even if your IT team consists of a cybersecurity professional, external consultants and other experts can provide your company with more insight, potentially reveal vulnerabilities that your internal team overlooked, and add a broad range of expertise and knowledge to the minds of your staff.
Most of the time, when organizations perform cybersecurity risk assessments, experts identify gaps in a business’s security practices undocumented risks and introduce new threats that weren’t initially in the company’s crosshairs. Identifying hidden internal and external cybersecurity threats could be the difference between saving your company’s data and trying to purchase it from ransomware.
Adaptable risk registers
Risk assessments reveal the most critical and pressing cybersecurity risks your business faces. In most cases, experts will also prioritize those risks based on your company’s resources, core values, and IT team’s capability so you can take immediate action.
The cybersecurity consultants will do their best to provide you with the insight and tools to create an effective risk-mitigation plan. Businesses should use the risk mitigation plan and the consultant’s problem-solving experience to identify how to solve vulnerabilities and address risks.
Understand how equipped your business is to address risks
Cybercriminals and hackers are not the only threats in cybersecurity. Corporate leaders must acknowledge and address non-malicious threats alongside harmful attacks. For example, a business not continually backing up critical data can cripple the entire organization and expose users and customers.
In the event of a power surge, fire, or natural wear and tear of the hardware, companies can face tremendous consequences if they do not mitigate the risk. This principle applies to every threat, scenario, and point of failure.
Risk assessment specialists almost always have or can help you acquire the resources to find vulnerabilities. When searching for cybersecurity consultants, managed cybersecurity services, or performing a risk assessment, consider these factors:
- Technical vulnerabilities
- Governance inconsistencies
- Compliance gaps
- Vendor risks
- Human error
- Risk prioritization
- Risk assessment frequency
- Tools and techniques used
- Business aspects covered in the risk assessment
While not all IT management companies in Philadelphia will specialize in network and cybersecurity, most can provide you with information, system, or cyber risk analyses for businesses to consider their services.

https://propersky.com/bidens-new-reporting-requirements-how-a-few-small-things-can-make-a-big-difference/,"Biden’s New Reporting Requirements: How a few small things can make a big difference
[10 min read]
President Biden recently signed a brand new bill for reporting cyber incidents for our critical infrastructure.
The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022, was passed by our Congress on the 14th of March. It was then signed into law by President Biden on March 15, 2022.
Within this Act, there is a section that deals specifically with cyber security. Section Y in this new omnibus bill is entitled The Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (“the Act”).
So how does this affect you?
Philadelphia’s IT security gurus at Proper Sky explain this Act further, and give concrete steps that can be taken to make a big difference in your own security.
Why is This Act Significant?
This Act is significant for many reasons, for both our cyber security and for other protections.
- It widely expands the reporting requirements for any federal cybersecurity incidents and ransom demands for our critical infrastructure entities.
- The law provides $13.6 billion in urgently needed aid to Ukraine as part of our country’s response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.
- It raises our defense spending by 5.6% – to $782 billion. Other discretionary funding is also raised 6.7% – to $730 billion.
- The bill reauthorizes the lapsed Violence Against Women Act from 2019.
- It bans the inaccurate depiction of Taiwan as part of China in any Maps from the US Department of State.
- All proposed funding surrounding the Covid 19 pandemic was dropped from the bill to allow it to pass through Congress quickly.
- There is so much to be discussed in regards to this act. Let us delve further into the cyber security reporting aspect of this Act.
What is Section Y?
You may be hearing people discuss Section Y and be wondering, what is this?
In “Section Y” of the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act, the bill mandates that critical infrastructure entities must quickly report particular cyber incidents and any paid ransomware to the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Agency).
Critical infrastructure entities include the vast network of:
- Highways
- Connecting bridges and tunnels
- Railways
- Utilities and buildings necessary to maintain normalcy in everyday life.
We can not afford a cyber attack on these networks. Our country’s transportation, financial and commerce sectors, clean water supplies, and much needed electricity and more, all rely on network systems to be working in tip-top order.
Quick Reporting Required
If there should ever happen to be a cyber attack or incident of some kind, this Act has new reporting requirements. It requires that companies report all cyberattacks immediately.
Reports from these critical infrastructure entities must follow these guidelines:
- All cyber incidents must be reported within 72 hours
- All ransomware payments must be reported within 24 hours.
Reporting must happen before completing a thorough investigation. Legal counsels and security teams may need to work more closely together for proper reporting and investigating.
All data pertaining to any cyber incidents, including any DOD cybersecurity policy actions, must be preserved until the case is resolved. The Act includes liability protection and confidentiality.
Within two years, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) will be issued to propose these final rules for putting into place these new requirements for the cyber Incident Reporting Act.
How You Can Stay Cyber-Safe
It has never been more important to protect your data, your company’s assets, and your employers from vicious cyber attacks.
There are steps you can take as an individual to keep safe from the external threats of phishers, and more.
- Do not click on any links or open attachments
- Regularly update your browsers on all of your devices.
- Regularly update all of your apps.
- Do not give out your private information without solid verification.
- Be sure to always back up your information.
- Delete anything that is sensitive information.
- Protect your passwords. Choose them carefully.
If you are a company or organization, you may want to outsource your security protocols to a respected IT professional or company. The importance of your company’s cybersecurity can not be underestimated.
Authentication Protocol Tools: DMARC, DKIM, and SPF
There are great authentication tools for you and your IT professionals to use to keep you safe. These include: DMARC, DKIM, and SPF.
DMARC, DKIM, and SPF are email authentication technologies in the cyber world.
The basic specifics of these technologies
DMARC – Stands for Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance.
“DMARC is an email authentication, policy, and reporting protocol. It builds on the widely used SPF and DKIM protocols by adding linkage to the author (“From:”) domain name, published policies for recipient handling of authentication failures, and reporting from receivers to senders, to improve and monitor protection of the domain from fraudulent email.”
DMARC can protect all of your domains from being targets of spoofing and phishing. It creates records of those that are authorized to send emails from your domain. DMARC is used by gmail. You may see an email rejected per DMARC policy.
SPF – Stands for Sender Policy Framework.
SPF is an email authentication system that was created to prevent other spoofers from sending emails from your domains.
When an email is received, an email provider will verify the SPF through DNS records. AN email is flagged as spam if it is not an IP address on your list. This will force it to fail a SPF authentication check. It will send the message “spf authentication has failed”.
DKIM – Stands for Domain Key Identified Mail.
DKIM is another email protocol system in which an organization can feel safe when transmitting an email message. It allows the user to sign it in a way that providers can verify. It uses cryptographic authentication to verify records.
Most IT professionals would recommend using these cyber security systems in a combination for complete coverage in your security. Together, they can fully protect all of your email domains from any attacks of spoofing or fraud.
How Does This Act Affect Me?
You may be wondering, how does the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act affect me?
In general, you should be happy to see that your government is taking steps to improve our overall cyber security. They are taking a solid role in improving our cyber safety.
With this act, our financial companies, energy companies, and more, will be required to report all cyber incidents. These infrastructures greatly impact all of us, and will be more protected by the CISA department of homeland security.
They impact our safety in our communities, our work, our home, our finances, our personal privacy, and more.
We all need cyber security to be of the utmost importance.
Final Thoughts
By adding extra security reporting protocols for stricter reporting of data breaches, etc, our government is ensuring that our public health and safety is greatly improved.
All companies, including those in our critical infrastructure communities, should take steps to increase their awareness of cybersecurity management and policy security measures.
Utilizing DMARC, SPF, and DKIM can give you and your company security from incoming attacks. Having a solid plan in place for how you choose to respond to any attacks is very important.
Reach out to your trusted IT professionals to help you and your company to implement a safety protocol today. As always, Proper Sky is here to help!

https://propersky.com/business-continuity-how-to-minimize-your-it-risks/,"Business Continuity: How to Minimize Your IT Risks
In simple terms, business continuity is what you do to make sure your business suffers the minimum possible disruption from an unexpected interruption. This could include a network crash, cyber attack, or physical damage to equipment. It’s a concept that has replaced the old term, “backup and disaster recovery.”
Using the term business continuity isn’t a rebranding exercise, but rather a change of mindset. It means concentrating on proactive solutions – making sure your technology doesn’t fail you in the first place – rather than reactive processes like backup and disaster recovery.
While backup and disaster recovery is still an vital aspect of business continuity, it’s much more cost-effective and more productive to focus on maximizing operational uptime, while relying on backups when your back is up against the wall.
Business Continuity Answers Fundamental Questions
The problem with thinking simply in terms of backup and disaster recovery is that it can create a false sense of security. Being able to answer yes to the question “Is our data backed up?” doesn’t answer a host of other, more fundamental questions such as:
- “Why did our network go down in the first place?”
- “How do we make sure this doesn’t happen again?”
- “What’s the procedure and how long will it take to restore operations?”
- “How is downtime affecting my bottom line?”
Business continuity answers these questions by getting to the root of problems first, before they have a chance to manifest themselves. It’s a proactive approach that saves time, money, and provides you and your staff with peace-of-mind.
Business Continuity Addresses a Host of Threats
One of the reasons for thinking more about business continuity as a whole rather than getting caught up in single specific measures is that the threats to a business are so diverse.
Just some of the events that could interrupt your network operations include:
- Software failure or corruption
- Malware
- Cyberattacks
- Data breaches
- Physical infrastructure damage from fire, flooding or other natural disaster
- An extended power cut
- Internet connection failure or interruption
Remember that some threats may lie beyond your premises. For example, if you rely on accessing data stored or processed by a third party, a problem there could interrupt your business as well.
Business continuity addresses each one of these threats by implementing tools, plans, and procedures to keep events like these from happening in the first place and mitigating the effects if they do happen.
Business Continuity Minimizes The True Cost of Downtime
One of the reasons businesses often underestimate the importance of business continuity is that managers don’t think through the full consequences. It’s not enough to reason, “If we lose files we’ll restore them from the back up: job done.” This reactive approach is bad for business!
For example, the time files or networks are unavailable is key. During this time you could be losing staff productivity. You could be missing out on new business. You could face financial penalties for delays fulfilling existing contracts. There could even be legal consequences: imagine, for example, a data breach that exposes sensitive customer information.
If your business is operating at full or close-to-full capacity, it’s not always as simple as being offline for a set period. When you are back up-and-running, it could take weeks or even months to catch up with the backlog.
Another element to think about is keeping track of exactly how up to date a backup is and if – or even how – you can deal with any disparities between the position you were in at the time of the backup and the position when the interruption happened.
The 3 Keys To Business Continuity
Exactly how to ensure business continuity will vary from business to business is why an overall strategy is key. You’ll need to think about the right measures for your situation. They’ll often fit into three main categories.
1) Backup & Recovery
We’ve covered some elements of this already, but it bears repeating that the logistics and timescale of recovering and restoring data is just as important as knowing the data is backed up in the first place.
You also need to consider the way in which you backup data and how you balance the need to have up-to-date backups against the costs and time of doing so. One option that suits some businesses is a more modular approach of backing up the most sensitive or time-critical data more frequently and then a more comprehensive back up at less frequent intervals.
Don’t overlook the risks to the backups themselves. For example, storing data on disks in your offices may protect them against a system failure, but won’t be any use if they are damaged by the same physical disaster that took out your computer hardware.
2) Network Security
Vital as backups are, reducing the need to use them is also key to minimizing business interruption. There’s a host of steps you can take to protect your network against disruptive breaches. Some may seem obvious such as strong security settings like passwords to authenticate users, or anti-malware protection.
Others are less well-known but may be even more important. For example, your business could be hit by a denial of service attack where either your website or your network is flooded with bogus requests for data, a crude but effective way of blocking legitimate connections.
3) Routine Upgrades and Maintenance
Cyberattacks snatch the headlines, but some threats are much more mundane. Hardware such as computers, storage drives or networking equipment can break down. Software can become corrupted or networking systems overloaded. The best way to protect against this is routine maintenance to adequately check everything is working as designed and spot potential problems before they become disruptive. You also need to keep an eye on infrastructure and make sure it’s up to date and has any relevant upgrades, making sure to check compatibility between the different elements of your network.
Developing Business Continuity Plans and Procedures
Developing a business continuity plan can’t be done with a “one size fits all” approach. For companies that do not have the time or expertise to develop plans and procedures in-house, many seek the help of a Managed Service Provider like Proper Sky.

Some Practical Business Continuity Planning and IT Advice for Small Businesses Affected by the Coronavirus
It’s 3/13/2020 at 2:11 in the afternoon. I am waiting with bated breath as we wait for the President’s speech at 3 p.m. Our company provides outsourced IT services around Philadelphia have been spending all of our time helping our customers navigate some of the potential waters ahead from what I’ll consider a “practical” IT standpoint. Let me share with you some of the resources we have found very helpful recently. I believe these offer some guidance and context for where we’re at now..
- First, here is a no-nonsense statistical look at the impact of the Covid-19 Virus as it evolves. This page is updated every couple of days, it’s well done.
- President Trump has authorized emergency funding for Small Businesses via the SBA, IMMEDIATELY. I highly suggest you read two articles. A primer that goes over the plan and the details from the SBA. You would be well served to consider these as we navigate the next few months.
- 78% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. 58% have less than $1000 in savings. Most of your staff will not be able to afford missed downtime and you may not be able to afford sustained outages but you certainly don’t want to risk infection either. Consider this as you make your decisions.
Now for IT Related Info So, as of yesterday, Montgomery County PA shutdown all non-essential services including schools, malls, daycare and more. We’re in MontCo so this affects us and many of your business. We suspect it’s a harbinger of things to come for all of us. So, we need to talk about business continuity for everyone. Each business is different, you’ll have different needs, expectations, etc. We’ll do our best to accommodate the most common issues we’ll see.
- Remote Access – We have and provide a remote access tool to users to connect to desktops. If you have users that want to work from home, securely, by connecting to their desktops. We can do that. Get started now.
- Telemedicine – We’re working out the details and systems now but for providers looking for ways to do some remote work, we have some HIPAA compliant solutions via Microsoft and Google that may be of value to you. If you’re interested in find out more, let me know and we’ll help you figure this out.
- Bills – Make sure you have a way to collect and pay bills remotely, especially power and internet. Get on eBill today for anything that you can think of that you’ll need to access your facility remotely. Phone, Internet, Security, Power, Gas, Electric, Water, etc. You may not want to be driving to the office to collect these.
- Phones – Many of you will want to work from home. In many cases, moving phones is as easy as plugging them into the internet or installing an app. Find out now what you need to do.
- Backups – Your servers will still be running, make sure your PC’s are up ensure your continue to have good backups. Consider what files you may need from the Office and we can look at One Drive / Google File Stream for getting access to those.
- Faxes – Yes, this dinosaur still exists. If you have not looked at eFax, there is no time like the present. Route your faxes that will convert them to PDF’s and send them to email so you can retrieve them.
- EMR / EHR / CRM – In many circumstances, these systems are cloud based and may be accessed from home. If you are access PHI or PII, DO NOT DOWNLOAD to your local PC. Also, ensure that you have antivirus installed and up to date. Many of you also have RDP access or VPN access. Test it now.
- Redundant Internet Connections – There may be time to add a backup WAN card to your router if you don’t already have it. Probably not but worth checking.
- Mobile Devices / Laptops – If you think you’ll have some users working for an extended period of time from home, you may want to think about some laptops and laptop spares, particularly if you’re lugging around PII or PHI. Buy them now.
- Financial Assistance – Read the SBS links above. 3.25% loans up to 30 years of payback for businesses impacted by the coronavirus. There is a first mover advantage. Read the program outlines and potentially consider it as part of your continuity plan.
If you have ANY questions about any of this, please give us a call (215.305.8899). We all need to get moving faster now. If this was helpful, let us know. Send us a Tweet, comment on Facebook or peg us on LinkedIn.

https://propersky.com/cloud-computing-maximize-team-collaboration-and-productivity/,"Cloud Computing: Maximize Team Collaboration and Productivity
Millions of businesses turn to cloud computing to improve their IT infrastructure and boost productivity. The cloud refers to applications and platforms that an organization accesses from the cloud service provider over the Internet. You don’t have the hardware or software on-premises. All you need to do is login to that platform from an Internet-connected device to use it. This configuration is a shift from companies hosting everything on-site. You often need to access these on-premises resources from a specific workstation or intranet, which makes it difficult for remote users to use it.
Benefits of Cloud Computing
Cloud computing opens up significant potential for companies looking to do more with their technology. One of the biggest advantages to bringing in cloud-based solutions is improving team collaboration. It eliminates the barriers that stand in the way of people using the same software or accessing shared data, since it’s hosted through a service provider rather than installed on individual workstations or on-premises servers.
Many cloud computing services have easy integration options through built-in support or a comprehensive API. Connectivity between applications and platforms allows cross-department and cross-team collaboration opportunities to flourish. Sharing features are sometimes available on cloud platforms, which provides another way to work together.
Cloud computing also has a major impact on productivity, both directly and indirectly.
- Everyone works off of the same information, which reduces repeated work caused by lost or inaccessible data
- Standardized platforms make it easier to train new employees on the work.
- The cloud service is already set up for remote access, so workers who are out of the office can still access the resources that they need to do their job. Telecommuting employees and those on business trips can maintain the same productivity levels as they do on-site.
- Business process optimization through cloud services and modern automation tools decrease the time that workers spend on time-consuming tasks. They can move on to core business functions rather than paperwork or other administrative overhead.
Outside of the advantages to team collaboration and productivity, the cloud represents major cost savings for companies. You don’t have upfront equipment or development costs to contend with, which eliminates a great deal of capital expenses. Instead, you pay a monthly service fee to the provider.
Types of Cloud Services
Many types of cloud services are available to meet your needs.
SaaS
Software as a Service, or SaaS, is the starting point for many companies. These cloud solutions are applications that are hosted by the service provider. For example, Gmail by Google is one of the most widespread cloud-based email systems. Since you can easily bring in a new application into business workflows, you can easily experiment with the cloud using SaaS options.
PaaS
Platform as a Service, or PaaS, is most commonly used for application development environments. The service provider sets up the hardware and software tools needed for this process and your developers access the resources remotely. This configuration replaces the need to maintain a development environment on-premises. The developers can quickly create new virtual environments to test their applications out and get additional compute power as needed.
IaaS
Infrastructure as a Service, or IaaS, is a full IT infrastructure based on the cloud. Specifically, you have a virtualization layer with your networking, data storage and compute power. You have more flexibility for customizing this environment to other needs outside of development.
Fast and scalable deployment are the biggest advantages to IaaS, as you don’t need to wait to install physical hardware to increase your capacity at any given time. Provisioning only takes a few minutes and several clicks, which can make a big difference in your overall operation.
XaaS
You’ll see many more XaaS acronyms out there – everything from database backup to cybersecurity is available in a service-based model on the cloud.
What Types of Cloud Services Do You Need
The types of cloud services that are right for your business depend on your needs and the IT strategy you have in place. For example, if you’re not developing applications, then a PaaS service may not deliver a lot of value to your company.
One way to determine the right cloud-based approach for your organization is to identify areas that are suffering from a lack of productivity and team collaboration. You can find SaaS solutions that solve their major problems and start your cloud deployment on a small-scale.
As you achieve success with these cloud implementations, you can start looking at more extensive options. You don’t have to go all the way up to being a completely cloud-native company. Some organizations put a few cloud-based applications in place and that works well for them. Others take everything into the cloud. You might find that your business works better somewhere in the middle of that.
Evaluate the performance of your cloud solutions on a regular basis to find the best way forward. Pay close attention to the feedback from the end users, as it’s impossible to gain the benefits from the cloud if no one ends up using the proposed solutions.
Working with a Managed Service Provider
If you don’t have an IT strategy or your current strategy fails to account for the cloud services, an IT company who provides Managed IT Services can give you the expert perspective needed to create a forward-thinking plan.
They can also suggest cloud-based solutions that support your organization’s goals and empower your employees with collaboration tools. A managed service provider with experience in your industry knows the most popular solutions on the market.

Cyber crime is an incredibly profitable industry, with revenue of $1.5 trillion per year. Attackers are highly motivated to break into business networks to access valuable data or demand payment from organizations to unlock their data. With the reality companies face your business needs a comprehensive set of security controls in place to thwart these attacks and stop attacks from getting in the way of productivity or creating massive financial losses.
Threats that can Bring Down an Organization
Cyber attacks are costly for businesses, especially if they result in unexpected downtime. Here are common threats that your organization may face.
- Phishing: Your employees deal with many emails in a day. They may not always look too closely at ones that seem “off.” Phishing tactics pass off fraudulent emails as legitimate to try to gain access to network resources, install malware on computers or otherwise disrupt business operations. Depending on the goal of the attacker, a phishing attempt can lead to network downtime, data and financial losses and compromised systems.
- Malware: These malicious programs have a number of effects on your network. They could create back doors for unauthorized access, disrupt performance, and compromise critical systems. It may be challenging to remove malware from systems depending on the method that it uses to proliferate throughout the network.
- Ransomware: Ransomware is a specific type of malware that encrypts the data on the network so that you’re unable to access it. The attackers demand a ransom to supply you with the encryption key, but they don’t always fulfill their end of the bargain. In many cases, organizations with proper backup solutions can ignore these demands and restore their systems from a previous backup or image.
- Internal Actors: Sometimes the attackers exist in your organization or with your external partners. Since they already have authorized access to some systems, they can leverage these accounts to break into other parts of the network.
- Advanced Persistent Threats: This is a broad term that covers sophisticated attacks that use a multi-faceted approach. The impact of advanced persistent threats can be long-lasting, with significant financial and operational losses.
Tools and Hardware to Secure Business Networks
The complex nature of modern IT infrastructure requires a comprehensive solution that covers network vulnerabilities. Firewalls and anti-malware solutions limit the opportunities for attackers to breach the perimeter of network. Intrusion detection allows your network administrators and IT security team to act quickly.
Mobile device management accounts for all of the business and personal mobile devices connecting to your network and puts security controls in place to stop compromised smartphones and tablets from bringing malware to the network.
User access control, authentication and authorization measures prevent users from having too much access to the system, as well as verifying that the person is who they say they are.
The Importance of Disaster Recovery
Data breaches can bring down your systems, cause data loss, reduce productivity and damage your reputation with your customers. A disaster recovery plan allows you to quickly bring your network back online to minimize the disruption to your operations.
The important areas to cover in this plan include:
- Which systems have the highest priority for getting back online
- What is the chain of command during disaster recovery
- Are any external partners involved in bringing systems back up
- What backup systems are in place
- Where are redundant systems located
- What failover systems are in place
- Who needs to be informed in the event of a disaster
- Who are the essential personnel for this situation
Cybersecurity Options
You have two cybersecurity options for protecting your organization.
In-house Team
You can have an in-house IT security team that handles implementing your security controls, monitoring the network, responding to attacks and deploying disaster recovery strategies. The advantage to having cybersecurity in-house is that you have full control over the team. However, sourcing skilled professionals can be difficult due to demand, and you have to consider the above-market salaries and overhead expenses such as benefits that they receive.
Another downside to consider is that putting cybersecurity responsibilities on your team will take them away from their supportive role. That exhaustion of resources will be exacerbated if a cyber attack occurs. This is why many companies opt to outsource their cybersecurity a partner.
Outsourcing to an MSP
Outsourcing to a Managed IT Service Provider that offers cybersecurity is another solution. You eliminate the costs associated with recruiting, onboarding and retaining IT security employees, along with paying for the services on an as-needed or monthly basis. You don’t have as much control over the team as you would with an in-house configuration, and you may need to ensure that external partners comply with any data security regulations that you have to follow.
Outsourcing Your Cybersecurity Needs
If you’re interested in pursuing the outsourcing option, then you can work with the Managed IT Service Provider to develop a Systems Security Plan (SSP). This document goes over all of the security controls that protect your network, the way that they’re implemented and other relevant information. It also covers the policies and procedures relating to information security.
A managed IT services provider is an excellent resource to have on hand for routine IT security and disaster recovery situations. They can complement your in-house team or act as the primary cybersecurity team as needed. For more information about Managed IT Services and how working with an MSP can help your business, please see our guide to Managed IT Services.
Cyber criminals have no deterrent to stopping their activities while they remain profitable. Your organization needs a robust set of defenses that minimizes vulnerabilities and addresses the most common attack methods. This approach makes you a less attractive target for low-hanging attacks and gives you more time to fight back against more complex intrusions.

EHR and EMR systems manage large sets of healthcare data analytics. But that’s actually a simple way to describe what EHR and EMR software does; in reality, the complexities of these systems — and of advanced data records — can overwhelm almost anyone. To avoid complications, it’s better to consider best practices prior to purchasing new software. We’ve been working with and using EHRs and EMRs for several years, and we’ve mastered some of the more convoluted aspects of the technology. We always advise our clients to consider these two factors before buying new EHR software.
- Before committing yourself to new software, it’s best to first ask this key question: “Does my organization have the internal capacity to provide the advanced reporting I know I’m going to need when the system is rolled out?” If you don’t have an employee who’s trained in the field of deep analytics, then it may be worth opting out of advanced reporting features when implementing new EHR/EMR software. You’re better off safe than sorry, and it’s always possible to go back and opt in for those features if you decide you do need them, in the long run.
- Sometimes, EHR and EMR packages come with “professional services” attached. In many cases, these “professional services” are in fact not professional at all – but the sales reps make it sound like they are. Instead, they’re basic features made to seem cutting edge. This isn’t how we run things at Proper Sky. We like to purchase and run reporting services independently of the EHR/EMR vendor, so that we have full control of the environment.
Make sure you factor in the cost and expertise for getting valuable data out of the system. Consider whether you’re able to handle deep analytical information at your organization or not, and if not, think about what the next best, most realistic option is. Be wary of complete “professional packages” that lead you to hard-to-use software that lacks the data you need.

https://propersky.com/help-desk-support-guide-for-company-executives/,"Help Desk Support: Guide for Company Executives
Your business needs a reliable, functional infrastructure day-in and day-out. When someone’s computer or software stops working or they can’t get a system to work, they’re not going to stay on task and meet deadlines. You may have a help desk in-place, but your in-house IT team has to handle everything from database administration to equipment deployment. Checking trouble tickets from end users and departments take them away from those critical tasks. A managed IT company can take over your help desk operations and deliver several major benefits to your organization. This article will cover those benefits.
Greatly Expand Your Team While Reducing Your IT Expenses
Recruiting and retaining qualified IT employees is a difficult task. If you need specialists with a certain technology or platform, you have to compete against many other companies looking for the same expertise. A managed IT support provider handles that side of things, so you’re not putting money into an expensive recruiting campaign or trying to beat job offers from larger competitors.
You pay a negotiated fee, which is typically a flat-rate per month, to get the help desk support that you need. You’re not dealing with overhead costs, benefits, insurance or any other expenses. Another cost advantage comes from the ability to scale this service up and down as needed. You may need more staffing following a new software or hardware deployment, or another situation that could lead to an increase in trouble tickets.
Improve Worker Productivity
Your employees fall behind on work when their equipment fails or their software isn’t working properly. A fully staffed IT support desk can quickly get to the support tickets so your staff can get back to what they were doing without a major disruption.
You also improve staff satisfaction and engagement when they don’t deal with system downtime or broken equipment every day. They feel valued and appreciated when their issues are handled as quickly as possible.
Lower Task Load on In-House IT Staff
Many IT departments need to think strategically and proactively to support business goals, but they’re unable to do so because they have to put out fires every day. When you outsource your help desk to a managed IT support company, you give the in-house staff enough time to catch their breath and start optimizing your infrastructure and operations.
Speed Up Troubleshooting
The managed IT services provider is focused entirely on help desk tickets. They don’t have to juggle priorities from multiple teams or departments. The only thing that they’re responsible for is providing technical support for end users, so they can devote all of their resources to the troubleshooting process.
In some cases, this approach can also improve the technical aptitude of your employees. After fixing the immediate issue, the help desk staff can recommend resources and training information that goes into detail about avoiding the issue in the future.
Remain Competitive in Your Industry
Some organizations have a seemingly endless IT budget that allows them to have a dedicated in-house help desk team without taking away from other critical areas. It’s difficult to compete with them in your industry unless you can match that level of responsiveness with the help of an IT support desk.
When your company’s help desk goes through a managed IT company, you end up with an excellent experience for everyone involved. Your business can focus on what they do best, without worrying about bottlenecks and troubleshooting when interacting with your technology.

https://propersky.com/how-companies-hide-their-exploits-around-others/,"How companies hide their exploits around others. I.E. MSFT had two 9.6 exploits they patched during the Log4J fiasco
[6 min read]
What are zero-day exploits and the CVSS scale?
Throughout 2021 the cybersecurity industry encountered hundreds of zero-day exploits. These vulnerabilities vary from minor inconveniences to threats that can cripple an entire organization.
Zero-day exploits are vulnerabilities in an organization’s hardware, software, cloud infrastructure, or code that allow hackers and malicious users to potentially pose a significant threat to an organization’s and their user’s information.
The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a scoring scale that ranks cybersecurity vulnerabilities by numerous factors to determine overall severity.
The CVSS Score Scale:
0.0 – No severity
0.1 – 3.9 – Low Severity
4.0 – 6.9 – Medium Severity
7.0 – 8.9 – High Severity
9.0 – 10.0 – Critical Severity
Typically, the highest CVSS score a vulnerability can score is 9.6-9.8, but on a rare occasion, a critically severe zero-day exploit will rank 10.0. The most notable example of a CVSS 10.0 is the infamous Log4J.
When companies encounter critically-severe vulnerabilities, they may disclose the vulnerability to the public, their software or cybersecurity vendors, or a third party. This is increasingly popular in the world of business IT support and managed cloud security services.
We recommend reading our other article, “What the 10.0 Means on a CVSS Score and Why The Log4J was such a big deal,” for more information about Log4J and zero-day exploits.
How companies can hide their zero-day exploits
Companies may or may not publically communicate zero-day exploits and therefore may sell the exclusive rights to the exploit’s knowledge as well. Most of the time, especially in the software scene, companies will contract ethical hackers or white hats to analyze, mitigate, and patch exploits privately.
When organizations discover high CVSS scoring zero-days, they may opt to keep the information about the vulnerability in-house for several reasons. Firstly, if the code, software, or hardware involved is patented, secret, or sensitive, companies will not share the data to prevent competing organizations from acquiring trade secrets.
Another reason companies opt to withhold zero-days from the public is to prevent hackers from capitalizing on these vulnerabilities. Organizations don’t want to advertise that they discovered a vulnerability, which may prompt an immediate attack.
Companies managed cybersecurity providers and even independent third parties exposing their vulnerabilities may invite hackers to act on malicious code implanted within an organization or encourage new attacks. This threat alone is incredibly dangerous for many businesses on high CVSS-scored vulnerabilities.
Companies outsource cybersecurity, software development, or administration to professional IT managed service providers so they may discover the vulnerability before the primary organization. The third-party may keep the patch in-house to analyze and patch the vulnerability in one place. This tactic is common with cloud-based managed service providers and healthcare-tied cybersecurity industries.
Microsoft hiding zero-day exploits with a CVSS score of 9.6 from the public
Log4J started in Minecraft, where malicious users discovered that they could run code remotely through the game’s chat function. Minecraft is built on java, one of the most ubiquitous programming languages on the internet.
Java’s prevalence exposed technological giants like Apple, Cisco, Tesla, and Twitter to adapting and increasingly dangerous risks every week. The Log4J vulnerabilities lasted months, and even today, some organizations still haven’t recovered.
In late 2021, Microsoft published information about a zero-day exploit patch that had been active for months. Even though Microsoft had known about the exploit long before the public, they didn’t disclose any vulnerability specifics other than generally warning Microsoft office users of the situation.
McAfee was the only other organization privy to the situation, which notified Microsoft of the compromised application. This zero-day allowed attackers to implant trojans into Microsoft Word documents remotely, and they would automatically trigger once documents were open.
This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2021-43905, scored a 9.6 CVSS, and Microsoft thinks it may have affected thousands of users. Microsoft has several more zero-day exploit reports publicly available, some scoring as high as 9.8.
Microsoft’s Log4J Word incident showcases why cybersecurity assessment and monitoring services are invaluable. If McAfee found the exploit any later, millions more users could have been affected.
What if cloud services providers didn’t help with privacy and security concerns? Leaving primary organizations to conduct cybersecurity best practices may indicate the difficulty of scaling on-site IT services.
If you, your business, or a technology-dependent organization have managed cloud-based advisory, strategy, testing, collaboration, or computing services, we highly encourage regular consultations and security analyses. In areas like Philadelphia, cloud services are critical, and investing in some of the best cyber security consulting firms may save your organization countless dollars in damages later on.

https://propersky.com/how-cybersecurity-insurance-is-getting-more-and-more-expensive-and-prescriptive/,"How Cybersecurity Insurance is getting more and more expensive and prescriptive
[5 min read]
Though it may sound counterintuitive, the increasing need for cybersecurity insurance is making cyber insurance policies more expensive and harder to acquire. As cyber insurance grows increasingly essential for modern businesses, influxes of zero-day exploits, ransomware attacks, and malicious cyber activity, insurers see fewer and fewer reasons to stay in business.
Experts say cyber insurance premiums have increased 50 to 100% in the last year alone. The exorbitant price hikes likely result from increasing ransomware attacks and ransom payment costs.
With some experts quoting over 80% increases in ransom payment costs, over 160% more malicious cyberattacks, and a changing business model raising the barrier for entry, some companies are questioning whether or not cyber insurance is worth it.
Why is cybersecurity insurance becoming more expensive?
In 2021, studies showed that 46% of companies opted for cybersecurity insurance. These companies sacrifice skyrocketing premiums and lower limits for their security. Statistics indicate that cyber insurers’ loss ratio is a record high, ballooning upwards of 73%.
Cybersecurity insurers state that increasing rates and increasingly limited cyber protection conditions result from frequent claims. For insurers to maintain competitive rates and complete protection, they must sustain streams of capital from premiums.
As companies continue claiming cyber insurance claims, insurers lose money. The uptick in attacks and claims creates compounding losses for insurers and dims their desires for the volatile business market of cyber insurance.
Demand is still increasing despite eye-watering price hikes and similar cyber insurance trends. In an increasingly cyber-dependent environment for entrepreneurs and legacy organizations incorporating more remote services, many businesses don’t have a choice.
These rapid changes in the insurance scene make it more difficult for businesses to adapt. Risk management becomes increasingly difficult to coordinate in an environment constantly shifting.
For example, companies must invest in adequate precautions against malicious hackers to save money on cyber insurance. Remote web access, employees working from home, and vertical integration within companies introduce more cybersecurity concerns.
Internal and external cybersecurity threats require special consideration and resources to protect and prevent. As the cost of supporting cybersecurity professionals and equipment teams increases, companies opt for cyber insurance to avoid complications. This mentality has created a prescriptive cycle of cyber insurance.
The main takeaway is that the increased rate of ransomware and cyber attacks is positively proportional to cyber insurers’ loss ratios resulting from their clients taking claims out. Cyber insurers are seeing fewer and fewer reasons to keep rates low without more capital and stable market conditions.
Instead, many organizations turn to managed service providers to escape unrelenting price hikes and prescriptive services.
What other options do companies have?
It’s no surprise that some companies depend on managed service providers (MSPs) for cybersecurity protection. Legacy and startup clients turn to MSPs for cyber defense, employee training, and consultation regarding how companies should handle ransomware attacks and security risks.
Organizations often hail MSPs to build, deploy, and maintain specialized cloud architectures, provide data backup solutions and mitigation strategies. MSPs distinguish themselves by having superior cybersecurity protection to meet the expanding market conditions and spiking demand.
MSPs understand why cybersecurity is important for business, and many big-name managed service providers will also include some form of insurance or coverage to protect their clients and staff. We recommend identifying any ransomware, cyber extortion, and cyber-attack insurance when analyzing MSPs

[7 min read]
The Russia-Ukraine conflict has been rampant for weeks. As the world observes global ripples throughout our economies, political climate, and even homes, the international conflict has given rise to numerous new issues.
Cybersecurity and cyber operation risks are some of the most prevalent and pertinent side effects of Russia’s latest aggression. The future of cybersecurity could be decided by what happens in these next few critical months.
Some opportunistic cybercriminals are using the conflict as cover for their illegal activities. While the world’s eyes are glued to news outlets and their minds occupied with thoughts and prayers for those harmed and displaced by the conflict, hackers can have a field day in the shadows.
One Russian hacker admitted to a ransomware plot against Tesla. The hacker attempted to bribe a Tesla employee $1 million to implant malware into Tesla’s electric battery plant in Nevada, one of the largest in the world. The FBI caught another set of hackers scanning U.S. energy firms for vulnerabilities and potentially zero-day exploits.
As Russian hackers target U.S. firms with malicious packages, fears of cyberterrorism are at an all-time high
The Russia-Ukraine conflict is bringing the importance of cybersecurity to light, being critical testaments to how a nation’s cyber presence can dictate its safety and defense competence. Despite the international conflict being somewhat new, there have been dozens of noteworthy cyber events, and many more to come.
Increased risk of Russian attacks
With U.S. sanctions setting in and American involvement teetering on overbearing, The Biden Administration warns the nation that it may already be a matter of time before the U.S. is targeted. Cybersecurity experts caution citizens and business owners to take every precaution possible.
The Biden administration backs the advice of professionals by warning everyone from families to businesses to strengthen their virtual defenses, tighten their online presence, and prepare for possible oversea online attacks.
Russian spearphishing campaign
Ukrainian cybersecurity agencies are warning countries of large-scale spearphishing attacks from the Russian Federation’s special services. The series of attacks involve fake Kyiv Police department emails and virus-injected text messages.
The emails and links contained modified remote access software that allowed foreign intelligence to gain unrestricted remote exercise over users’ computers and phones. These accusations and endeavors from the Russian special services date all the way back to 2014, further pushing governments to tread carefully around Russian cyberspace.
Large cybersecurity and antimalware companies like Malwarebytes are publishing extensive articles and reports circumnavigating the complicated and intrusive phishing scandals. We highly recommend that business owners, cybersecurity professionals, and security-conscious individuals read articles like this for more information.
Microsoft found that Russia is behind nearly 60% of state-backed hacks
Microsoft’s cybersecurity team found that Russia accounted for nearly two-thirds of state-sponsored attacks throughout the last year. Microsoft publishes large, in-depth analyses of its cyber findings throughout the year.
The Digital Defense Report observed dozens of cyberattacks carried out through Microsoft software vulnerabilities, many of which point back to Russia’s foreign intelligence service. However, Russia and its intelligence personnel are denying any involvement.
Microsoft also denoted a 58% increase in all hacks detected by the company alone, up from just over 50%. The Defense Report also details how such attacks may impact U.S. allies and adversaries, cites ransomware attacks on various countries, and analyzes hacking patterns of high-profile countries.
Hackers Releasing Data From Belarus to Overthrow The Lukashenko Regime
These hackers, The Belarusian Cyber Partisans, have recently released portions of a massive data trove that supposedly includes secret police and government databases. The highly secretive information contains arrays of accused police informants, personal government official information, spies, and police drone and prison video footage.
According to sources, the hacked databases also contain hidden mortality statistics from Belarus’ Covid-19 outbreak, indicating thousands more people died than the government has publicly declared.
The hackers also took responsibility for compromising over 240 surveillance cameras. Experts quote that long-term consequences could lead to severe socio-economic consequences.
If the information gets audited, government proclamations could be rendered null and void, international efforts could be used to prosecute Lukashenko and his allies. Exploiting Lithuanian infrastructure currently causes countless problems within the country, such as excessive COVID-19 lockdowns, crippled counter-espionage teams, and threatening the entire country’s national security.
Russian Hackers and Baltic energy networks
Multiple hackers are suspected of launching exploratory hacks against Baltic state energy networks. Sources also state that this could prove problematic for NATO countries.
The Baltics, despite being caged into Russia’s energy network, plan to unite grids with the European Union, a NATO country. Sources indicate that hackers have exploited Baltic networks for over two years, parallel with much more severe Ukrainian attacks that nearly shut the county down.
Russian hackers don’t stop there. Dozens of widespread cyber disruptions have threatened the safety of citizens and government security. From malware and ransomware attacks to implementing zero-days as they please, the Ukrainian conflict is birthing new and increasingly dangerous threats, some rooting as far back as 2014.

https://propersky.com/how-to-become-hipaa-compliant-in-philadelphia-2/,"How to Become HIPAA Compliant in Philadelphia
How to Become HIPAA Compliant in Philadelphia
Healthcare organizations in Philadelphia have had to follow HIPAA regulations for almost three decades. The purpose of the original legislation was to ensure patient health record safety by putting into place clear standards that organizations could follow. It’s important that all healthcare organizations in Philadelphia understand how to become HIPAA compliant.
Managing your Philadelphia practice within HIPAA regulations can be challenging, especially since HIPAA rules can be changed and updated regularly. In this guide, we’re going to take an in-depth look at why regulators created HIPAA, why healthcare offices need to comply, and what strategies healthcare organizations in Philadelphia can use to remain compliant.
Why Were HIPAA Regulations Introduced?
HIPAA, or the Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, was created in 1996 to better regulate practices within healthcare facilities. The act was incredibly wide-ranging and included provisions to improve the accountability of health insurance coverage and prevent fraud, but ultimately HIPAA has been most dedicated to mandating protection of sensitive patient information.
In 2003, regulators introduced the first HIPAA Privacy and Security Rule. This rule defined Protected Health Information‚ or the kind of patient information that healthcare providers are required to protect. Protected data includes any information held by a healthcare organization that concerns the “healthcare status, provision of healthcare, or payment for healthcare” of any patient in their care.
The purpose of these regulations is to help protect patient data against growing threats and most particularly, cyberattacks. These regulations also ensure that healthcare providers and insurers cannot abuse information or apply unfair terms and policies to patients by making their data publicly available.
Why Do Healthcare Organizations in Philadelphia Need to Be Compliant?
In the early years of HIPAA, many healthcare organizations did not follow the Privacy and Security Rules. Legislators, therefore, introduced the Enforcement Rule in March 2006, which gives the HHS the authority to investigate complaints against providers that did not abide by the rules.
The Enforcement Rule also allowed the Department’s Office for Civil Rights to bring criminal charges against any healthcare organization that repeatedly flouts the rules, increasing the stakes for executives and managers considerably.
The fines for non-compliance are quite substantial. There are four tiers of penalties that authorities can impose on individual practices based on their level of knowledge of a breach and the actions that they could have taken to prevent it:
1. First Tier: $100 – $50,000 Fine Per Incident
Authorities can fine healthcare organizations between $100 and $50,000 per incident if the provider did not know and had no reasonable way of knowing about the breach.
2. Second Tier: $1,000 – $50,000 Fine Per Incident
Second-tier fines apply to organizations who knew about a breach or who could have taken reasonable steps to counter to the violation but who did not act with “willful neglect.”
3. Third Tier: $10,000 to $50,000 Per Incident
Third-tier fines apply when healthcare providers act with willful neglect but correct the issue within a 30-day time period.
4. Fourth Tier: $50,000 Per Incident
Fourth tier fines apply to healthcare providers who act with willful neglect and do not make corrections within 30 days.
How Does the HIPAA Security Rule Apply to Healthcare Offices in Philadelphia?
As mentioned, the HIPAA Security Rule is a document that lists all of the rules that healthcare providers must follow when handling patient data. The law contains a variety of technical and non-technical standards to which healthcare organizations must comply. Before the HIPAA Security Rule, there were no standard set of rules governing how healthcare organizations in Philadelphia had to use patient data.
Some of the primary provisions medical facilities must follow according to the Security Rule are as follows:
- Organizations must ensure the availability and confidentiality of all transmitted, created, or received patient data.
- Providers must identify and protect against all reasonably anticipated threats to patient data security and integrity.
- Providers must make sure that their workforce complies with the rules set out by HIPAA.
- Healthcare organizations must protect against all reasonably anticipated disclosures or unauthorized use of patient data.
In these ways, the Security Rule holds Philadelphia medical practices directly responsible for ensuring that patient data is not unlawfully disclosed.
When deciding which security measures to use, organizations are permitted by the HSS to take into consideration things like the cost of various security measures compared to annual revenue, their current technical and defensive hardware, and the risks posed to patient confidential information. All of these could differ depending on the size of the organization.
Regardless of your practice’s size, however, it is always recommended that you
Options for Implementing HIPAA-Compliant Security Measures
Different organizations choose varying methods to ensure their IT complies with HIPAA regulations. Some decide to manage their in-house, while others outsource the task to Managed Service Providers.
Do-It-Yourself HIPAA Compliance
Some healthcare organizations opt to take their HIPAA compliance into their own hands by relying on internal resources to maintain IT systems and cybersecurity. Members of the organization usually meet to discuss all of the terms of the Security Rule and how they will follow them.
Following these steps is crucial in maintaining HIPAA compliance within your practice:
- Use a self-assessment checklist to determine whether the organization currently abides by HIPAA standards.
- Use a risk assessment tool, such as the one provided by the ONC for Health Information Technology. This tool reveals the threats facing a healthcare provider and includes guidance on how to mitigate them.
- Finally, many organizations choose to use tools such as the NIST HIPAA Security Rule Toolkit to ensure they’re remaining compliant with the Security Rule over time. This tool is helpful for restructured organizations or those who have changed their IT infrastructure.
Keep in mind that while do-it-yourself HIPAA compliance might seem appealing and more cost-effective, it’s not for everyone. Some organizations have the internal expertise to abide by the Security Rule, but many don’t. Trying to manage your practice’s HIPAA compliance yourself could end up costing you more money in incident fines in the long run.
Outsourced HIPAA Compliance In Philadelphia
The alternative approach to maintaining HIPAA compliance yourself is to outsource IT management to a third-party service provider that specializes in Managed IT Services for Healthcare providers. When providers outsource, they have access to teams of skilled technicians who understand the Security Rule inside out and know how to make sure the organization obeys it.
Additionally, healthcare-focused Managed Service Providers are able to provide an expert perspective on the IT operations of medical offices specifically and manage your IT according to your practice’s needs.
Some of the services MSPs provide to ensure healthcare facilities remain compliant include the following:
Gap Analysis
A gap analysis investigates your current practices and then quantifies how far from full HIPAA compliance you are currently. Gap analysis examines factors such as how organizations store data records, how they report on incidents, and how many of their senior staff are trained on the Security Rule.
Remediation
MSPs also help healthcare service providers put into place systems that help them become more compliant, based on the results of the gap analysis.
Cybersecurity Planning
Finally, MSPs help organizations in Philadelphia maintain HIPAA compliance by bolstering their cybersecurity plans to meet HIPAA regulations and streamlining operations to adapt to that plan.

[8 min read]
The realm of managed internet tech and information services, also known as managed IT services, is becoming bigger and bigger. The managed service provider (MSP) business model has become increasingly helpful for small and medium businesses (SMBs) whose products rely on IT. MSPs also greatly help companies grow by providing a myriad of resources, tools, and solutions to supplement a company’s most critical technology service needs.
MSPs are similar to enterprise-scale technology providers that can provide you with staffing, security measures, intranet stability, and other technical resources. If you know your technical goals, choosing a set of managed IT services is as easy as picking a plan and signing up.
If you are considering partnering with an MSP for your business but aren’t sure if managed services will benefit you, we’ve put together a few key points to help you decide.
A Proactive vs. reactive approach to your IT services
In the IT service space, businesses often reactively approach service issues. This means it is more resource-efficient to control and manage IT product problems when something is wrong. Especially for small and medium businesses, constantly devoting resources to issue management isn’t cost-effective or, in some cases, possible at all.
Reactively responding to IT issues can also result in more extended downtimes, scrambling team members, and can leave customers, users, or clients without the products they pay to use.
Using managed services providers can help you and your business actively prevent and prepare for technical issues long before they ever become a concern. One of the best advantages of proactively monitoring and controlling problems is that minor issues hardly have the opportunity to spiral out of control.
Proactive risk management dramatically minimizes the risk that you’ll lose time, money, prospective clients, and resources to unexpected IT dilemmas.
MSPs are perfect fits if you or your business have difficulty scaling your IT infrastructure or dedicate resources to daily necessities like network speed and server dependability. Almost every technology-based company has everyday IT needs, each coming with its own set of potential problems.
MSPs can adapt to whatever product, service, or needs you may have and fix any issues with as little involvement as possible from you and your team. This service approach allows businesses to re-evaluate their needs and periodically adjust their IT services.
Increased service and product reliability
Managed service providers excel at solving some of the most headache-inducing problems businesses encounter. In particular, in-house issues like spotty network coverage, slow servers, malfunctioning workstations, and more are all solvable through outsourcing IT services.
MSPs have advanced technical solutions for almost any obstacle a business may encounter. Managed service providers ensure that everything, both in and out of your office, is functioning optimally.
Ensuring your business has reliable and stable products and services is just the tip of the iceberg. MSPs also implement security solutions that continually detect possible external threats to computer security, disturbances, and vulnerabilities.
Downtime due to technical problems can create a domino-like effect on productivity throughout your entire organization. When your employees can’t access vital tools, customers can’t access your website or application; you begin to notice compounding adverse effects.
If you or your business has ever experienced a chaotic scramble to reconfigure technical products with waiting customers, then you know how important every one of these interactions is. When you have 20 employees waiting in line to get ahold of your technical support team, or 15 more unable to place an order or access their data, only MSPs can truly save the day.
Because MSPs monitor, analyze, identify, and resolve issues before they even happen, you hardly experience downtime or detrimental service issues when working with MSPs. Most MSPs will offer various levels of service level management for you to choose from based on your needs.
MSPs can also backup, protect, and secure critical information. This way, you can implement alternative solutions for avenues for perpetual IT service provisions in the event of a cyber security nightmare. While these may sound like common security tactics, often, rudimentary security measures prevent devastating hacks.
If you are an organization whose customer base relies on dependable, secure, and bug-free products, MPSs can take almost all the stress of maintaining those high standards off your shoulders.
Reducing volatile IT costs and return on investment
Managed service providers help control the countless significant IT expenses and thus bear a high return on investment. If your business’s IT budget includes labor, constant advanced maintenance services, software, network infrastructure, hardware costs, and security expenses, MSPs can take much of that burden off you.
Additionally, managed IT services allow you to dynamically scale and grow as fast as possible, whereas traditional IT teams can’t keep pace with exponential demand. Since MSPs use fixed subscription package costs, you and your businesses can easily project IT expenses and dedicate the saved finances towards other, possibly critical business services.
Managed service providers also give you complete access to technically skilled IT staff at a fraction of the cost of training and hiring your own. MSPs propose an excellent value for small businesses that don’t have an endless budget to recruit the latest and most extraordinary talent.
Suppose your business’s success depends on having professional talent and expensive IT services; however, you’re currently dedicating most of your resources to other critical tasks. In that case, MSPs can provide you with the proper equipment and skill you need. This strategy allows you to maximize your IT budget without sacrificing quality.
Additionally, if you already have trained, professional talent, you can outsource your mundane maintenance tasks, repetitive monitoring, and other monotonous operational duties to MSPs.
MSPs do their best to facilitate a “cut costs, grow stronger” methodology.
Strengthen security
An overwhelmed IT staff can sweep patch management under the rug in small and medium businesses and large corporations. This increases your business’ risk of downtime, security loopholes and leads to potential data breaches.
Managed service providers can help you avoid critical security risks by consistently providing your business with the necessary applications, software, and security updates for preventative and reactive countermeasures for your data and products.
Additionally, MSPs supply their clients with trained cyber security professionals who handle issues in various enterprise environments. MSPs sometimes also train talent to target external IT security threats to small and medium businesses.
Some MSPs will also provide services that include disaster recovery teams to help recover, protect, and retrieve data in the event of a critical data breach. If there is one thing SMBs should prioritize, it’s protecting customers’ data and upgrading poor data security systems.
If you own or help operate a small or medium business, utilizing managed service providers is one of the best ways to expedite rapid scalability and growth. The benefits, services, and assistance MSPs provide through managed IT services can often be the headstart businesses need to manage resources and funds.
Businesses that understand the concepts of security threats, challenges, vulnerabilities, and risks can make finding advanced technological solutions from MSPs much easier.

[6 min read]
It’s no doubt that startup companies and small and medium businesses (SMBs) encounter difficulty scaling upwards, especially in today’s market. The IT industry seems never-ending, and there’s massive competition for new innovators and business founders as we head into 2022.
On top of a highly competitive market, businesses face pressure as we transition to remote, work-from-home, and hybrid work environments. These changes stress small and medium IT departments, driving up operational risks and costs.
Additionally, businesses must continue to bolster their cybersecurity and networking capabilities to keep up with the changing market and staffing complications. Organizations with the resources and budget to rectify these issues often flow through these IT bubbles without many problems.
However, SMBs can’t always compete with powerful or legacy corporations. So, how do SMBs capitalize on available resources to keep up with larger companies? Managed IT service providers (MSPs) supply the solution.
We’ve already discussed MSPs and IT management services in our other articles, “What are managed IT services?” and “What are the benefits of managed IT services.” We encourage you to read them if you are unfamiliar with MSPs and their services. This article will look at how companies leverage MSPs and use managed services to their advantage.
Efficient Cybersecurity & more
Cybersecurity is one of the most popular services SMBs seek out from managed service providers. MSPs grant unparalleled value to companies that want to protect their data or secure their workplaces.
Cost is one of the primary benefits of using MSPs for cybersecurity. This is also how SMBs and succeeding companies leverage MSPs to reduce spending and improve their financial resource allocation.
The International Data Corporation states that for every 100 users, businesses can save over $400,000 annually by working with a managed service provider. MSPs provide tremendous value in this regard.
Usually, MSPs have the resources, personnel, and bandwidth to support numerous high-fidelity projects concurrently. Once your business is ready, most MSPs provide subscription plans that can actively scale up or down depending on your business’ needs. This is how succeeding organizations in the current market leverage their net costs and the savings of using MSPs
Moreover, MSPs also provide their clients with much-needed breathing room. Imagine having dozens of resource-demanding, time-intensive, and expensive operating tasks off your plate.
Businesses can receive the same quality expertise through MSPs instead of recruiting, training, and compensating large IT teams. Companies also have peace of mind that their practices abide by all legal requirements and industry standards.
Some MSPs will provide their staff’s credentials, certifications, and experience for added peace of mind.
This principle applies to all managed IT services, not just cybersecurity.
Managing tasks to free up staff
Managing tasks or operations that you don’t have the resources, time, or expertise for can leave the team members you have on hand to focus on more pertinent matters. Thriving businesses in the industry live by this principle, by offloading tasks that they can’t or don’t want to devote resources to.
As a result, IT departments of SMBs and even multi-million dollar corporations no longer worry about tech support, monitoring and controlling data, bug fixes, updates, or even hosting servers and databases; it’s all taken care of.
Businesses can apply the business-managed service methodology to various aspects of entrepreneurship; IT is not a limiting factor. Contemporary companies implementing this strategy use their newly available time, resources, and less-stressed staff to tackle assignments that accelerate their growth and lead to upward scaling.
Everyone, from large corporations to a small team of entrepreneurs can benefit from leveraging the benefits of MSPs
What to keep in-house
While managing system administration and IT infrastructure services grants businesses valuable headroom, successful organizations don’t usually manage everything. Check out our various other articles for assistance in recognizing which services you are better off keeping local.
Strategize and implement
Depending on your business’s needs, current resources, talent, budget, and size, the services you and similar organizations may manage will vary. How much your managed IT services cost changes depending on how many services you expect to outsource and how demanding they are.
Identify which services your business will benefit most from managing, and use the resources you save to devote to other aspects of the company. Here are some popular managed services SMBs and large businesses use:
- Monitoring, controlling, and management of servers and databases
- Remote communication management
- Cloud services and management
- Cybersecurity, disaster preparedness, and data recovery
- Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
- Business IT support services
- Many more
Managed IT services for small businesses can be the gateway to exponential growth, smooth scalability, and efficient resource use. If you, your company, or your team has difficulty analyzing all the factors, consider enrolling in management consulting for startups.
From there, they can show your team the best examples of company resource use, how long a company is considered a startup, and what managed IT services are most effective for small businesses.

How to Respond to a Healthcare Data Breach in Philadelphia
In the peak of the digital age, cyberattacks are becoming more and more common, and healthcare facilities are unfortunately at the top of hackers’ list of targets. With a slew of sensitive information that’s worth a lot of money to healthcare providers and patients, medical practices attract frequent vicious cyberattacks, especially using ransomware.
No matter how secure you believe your IT systems are, it’s important to be aware of how you should respond in the event of a healthcare data breach. The following article describes how healthcare providers in Philadelphia should respond to a data breach (that is, unauthorized disclosure of a patient’s private health information).
The Official Breach Notification Rule
Under HIPAA regulations, the Breach Notification Rule 45 CFR §§ 164.400-414 mandates that providers and their associates notify certain people when a healthcare data breach occurs. Those you must notify include the individuals affected by the breach, the Secretary of the US Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), and, in some instances, the media.
What Counts as an Official Breach in Philadelphia?
Before you respond to a breach, you must find out whether it is considered a breach by HIPAA regulations. A breach occurs when there is loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of healthcare data, as in the following examples:
- Confidentiality: An unauthorized person viewed the data. This person may be a hacker, a marketing group, or an unintended recipient of a fax or other message.
- Integrity: Someone has logged onto the server and tampered with a patient record, causing doctors to diagnose patients based on incorrect or falsified information.
- Availability: A hospital gets a cryptolocker ransomware virus for several days and is unable to provide records. This qualifies as a breach even if the data was not viewed or modified, since the data became unavailable to patients and providers.
Providers in Philadelphia, therefore, have to make a judgment based on their assessment of the breach to determine if it falls under the Breach Notification Rule. If a practice determines not to notify anyone, it must demonstrate that the probability of having lost unsecured protected information during the breach is low.
The HHS recommends that organizations consider the following four factors when deciding whether to notify others of a breach:
- The type of health information concerned, including the identifiers.
- The person to whom unauthorized disclosures may have been made or who used the information.
- Whether any protected patient data was acquired or viewed.
- The extent to which the risk to protected health information is now mitigated.
Organizations (and their associates) are allowed to make a notification of breach without first having carried out a risk assessment.
What Doesn’t Count as an Official Breach?
While knowing what constitutes a breach is essential, it’s also important that healthcare providers in Philadelphia know which scenarios HIPAA does not consider a violation.
There are three main cases in which health providers would not need to notify others of a breach:
- A member of the organization’s staff unintentionally views a patient’s protected information. If the person who saw the health records did so in good faith and within the scope of their job duties, it would not be considered an official breach.
- One person who is authorized to view protected information inadvertently shares it with a second authorized person. In this case, there is no need to report a breach, so long as both entities would otherwise be authorized to access said information.
- The covered healthcare provider has good reason to believe that the unauthorized person who accessed protected information cannot save, store, or disperse the information to others.
How To Comply With Breach Notification Requirements In Philadelphia
If during your assessment you discover that there has been an official breach, the HHS requires that you make a series of notifications to various persons:
Notify the Individual
If you suspect that unauthorized persons may have viewed patient records, you must inform the affected patient(s), either by first-class mail or email. If you decide to communicate via email, you must obtain the patient’s permission first. This notification must be issued within 60 days of the breach.
If more than 10 patients are affected by the breach, then you must also place a notification on your website for the next three months or inform media outlets and publications which can inform the public on your behalf.
Notify the Media
HIPAA rules state that if more than 500 people are affected by a healthcare data breach, practices in Philadelphia are required to inform the media. Most healthcare organizations do this via a press release. You must also issue this notice within 60 days.
Notify the Secretary of the HHS
As well as notifying the individuals involved and the media, healthcare organizations must also inform the Secretary of the HHS. You can do this through the HHS website by completing and submitting this electronic Notice of Breach form. If the breach involves more than 500 people, covered entities must notify the Secretary without reasonable delay and within a 60-day timeframe. If the breach involves fewer than 500 people, the covered entity may notify the Secretary on an annual basis, but the entity must still record these breaches.
Notifications from Business Associates
Sometimes business associates suffer breaches of protected health information too. Business associates must follow the same process as you, had you been the agency responsible for the violation. Business associates should provide you with data on which of your patients had their records exposed and issue notifications as well.
How To Minimize The Effect Of A Data Breach
Data breaches are, unfortunately, regular occurrences within the healthcare industry. If your Philadelphia organization has experienced a breach, then you could benefit from using a Managed Service Provider (MSP) .
Managed IT Service Providers who specialize in healthcare understand how to measure the risks to your patients’ protected data and make appropriate adjustments to your cybersecurity plan. MSPs can help you discover vulnerabilities that exist in your cybersecurity and eliminate them. By working with a healthcare-focused MSP, you can limit damage that occurs in the case of a future breach.

https://propersky.com/increase-in-number-of-zero-day-exploits-and-what-it-means/,"Increase in number of Zero-Day Exploits and what it means
[7 min read]
What are zero-day exploits?
A zero-day vulnerability is an umbrella term that categorizes unknown system vulnerabilities in software or hardware. Hackers and malicious users can exploit these vulnerabilities to create costly or catastrophic damage before anyone realizes what’s happening.
Often, especially in new software, security vulnerabilities exist. Most of the time, software developers patch these issues or use automated tools to help them pinpoint vulnerabilities.
However, hackers are sometimes already two steps ahead. They use these security vulnerabilities to implement code to prevent developers from identifying the exposure and thus take advantage of the code later on. This is called exploit code.
Sometimes malicious code can implant itself into devices automatically through network vulnerabilities and email scams. Human error is often the cause of many attacks, emphasizing the importance of educating others on finding and mitigating zero-day exploits.
Identity theft, holding data for ransom, extortion, personal attacks, and even total system corruption can result from a single zero-day exploit. Hacktivists seeking to draw attention to themselves can take control of a system to reach a wider audience and manipulate confidential information for a political goal.
Increase in zero-day vulnerabilities and exploits
Cybersecurity professionals have caught more zero-day exploits than ever in the last year. According to reputable sources and researchers, over 70 zero-days were found, almost double that of 2020 and higher than any other year ever recorded.
Despite the eye-watering numbers, what does the prevalence of zero-days mean? Do today’s companies have poor cybersecurity programs or are the hackers growing stronger? How do we prevent and prepare for cybercrime?
What does the increase mean?
The first and most straightforward conclusion is that with the increase of accessible hacking tools and a lower barrier for entry, hackers are more common than ever. The more people hack, the more likely they will find zero-day vulnerabilities.
Additionally, reports show that government-sponsored hacking is becoming an increasingly popular endeavor. China is suspected of nine zero-day exploits alone, potentially indicating prevalent aggressive usage in the near future.
Private cybersecurity firms are also noticing zero-day contracts, as the rapidly growing exploitation industry makes these services more accessible. Modern cybercriminals are monetizing zero-day exploits, and everyone from private companies to entire governments are supplying their expansion.
Despite the worrying prospect of living in fear of cybercrime for hire, the law of supply and demand shows that the increased demand for hackers has also ushered an important market for defending against them. Namely, even though cyber criminals make money from zero-day exploits, more companies invest additional financial resources in cybersecurity.
What are companies doing to prevent zero-day attacks?
Large tech companies are even placing bounties on catching, isolating, or preventing zero-day exploits in software and hardware. The market continues to adapt to evolving and intricate hacks, allowing new and emerging talent to make names for themselves in the industry.
Financial incentives are one form of zero-day threat prevention. Despite help from external cybersecurity firms and risk-threat vulnerability consultants, the responsibility of supporting a consistent defense against zero-day attacks falls on businesses.
Companies like Microsoft, Google, CrowdStrike, and Splunk are investing substantial resources to mitigate zero-day exploits on a massive scale. What was once rudimentary anti-virus software evolved into a combination of man and machine working simultaneously to detect, trace, and patch vulnerabilities across millions of devices, thousands of networks, and hundreds of software instances?
Multi-faced security protocols, a stronger push for cybersecurity, and the culmination of hundreds of thousands of hard-working professionals help foster an environment discouraging high-tech crime. Better, more sophisticated attacks create robust, intelligent zero-day attack solutions.
One benefit of industry professionals and cybercrime defense organizations publishing data and analytics on zero-day code is educating growing industries on the importance of zero-day attack protection and the vulnerability management process.
Additionally, especially in cloud-based organizations, hackers now must find several zero-days and chain them together to coordinate an attack. As defenses mature, this becomes incrementally more difficult for hackers to breach our data.
Here are a few of the most notable zero-day vulnerabilities and exploits recently:
The Google Chrome zero-day vulnerability (2021)
Chrome met several zero-day threats throughout 2021 as the world’s most popular browser. The most impactful exploit forced Chrome to push unwanted updates to users, opening the potential to implant unwanted code into dozens of various devices.
The vulnerability stemmed from a bug in the open-source JavaScript engine used for Chromium web browsers. Google quickly released patches for the threat, but this could have easily resulted in catastrophic damages to millions of innocent users.
The Zoom zero-day vulnerability (2020)
In 2020, when Zoom was rapidly becoming the world’s most used video conferencing utility, many hackers and cybercriminals wanted to test their ability to be a part of the hype. The zero-day vulnerability involved hackers remotely accessing users’ computers if they were running Windows 7.
If the user was using Zoom on an administrator account, the hacker could remotely access every file on their computer, monitor network information, and of course, steal passwords. Those users that their Zoom clients restricted their remote sharing capabilities while Zoom developed a solution.
Learning how hackers exploit operating system vulnerabilities and developing intelligent means of removing zero-day viruses helps us remain as protected as possible as the cybercrime market grows. It’s vital to constantly perform the best cybersecurity practices and stay updated with what’s happening in the industry to maneuver around the next potential zero-day exploit.

Businesses rely on technology more than ever. Unexpected downtime and insufficient system capacity can lead to significant costs for the organization. IT infrastructure design plays an important role in how your business functions on a daily basis and the opportunities for scaling in the future.
Infrastructure Strategic Planning
A custom “from the ground up” plan is an essential part of designing an IT infrastructure that supports your business goals. This approach creates an infrastructure that aligns closely with the organization and the strategic decisions that you’ll make. A customized IT infrastructure plan will eliminate waste by choosing the best technology that provides measurable results and ROI. There are three important areas to consider during your infrastructure planning.
1. How Well the IT Infrastructure Serves the Needs of the Business
What are your essential business needs and how can technology support them? Each organization has unique requirements, so this process is not as simple as using the same types of solutions as other businesses in your industry. Technology should support your overall mission rather than getting in the way.
2. How the Infrastructure Maximizes Productivity of Its Workers
The solutions selected need to provide employees with essential resources for accomplishing their daily job duties. If the infrastructure is difficult to work with, your staff may not fully adopt it.
When technology helps workers maximize their productivity, they can complete tasks faster and improve their satisfaction with the job environment. The infrastructure supports this reality by operating reliably and securely. Training resources and change management ensure that your employees use these solutions so you get the best possible ROI.
3. How Scalable the Infrastructure is as the Company Grows
You don’t know exactly where your business is going to be in five or ten years. While forecasting provides you with some insights, your market could shift unexpectedly. New technology opens up the possibility of different business models and opportunities that are currently unforeseen.
The IT infrastructure needs to account for these changes. When you create a plan based around your predicted and potential growth rates, you can react quickly to the unexpected. For example, you may choose to use cloud-based solutions for your content delivery network so scaling up only takes a few clicks. You can also look for solutions that have robust integration options. While a particular piece of software may not have all the future features you need, APIs and powerful development kits give you flexible options.
Routine Upgrades and Maintenance of the Infrastructure
The initial IT infrastructure planning is only the first step. The technology world changes on a regular basis, so you need a way to keep up with this business landscape.
Routine upgrades and maintenance benefits your organization in several ways:
- Introduces new productivity enhancing features: Ongoing software and hardware development can lead to improved methods of handling business processes.
- Improves the lifespan of equipment: Hardware can run into operational issues that impact its effective lifespan. If the data center has insufficient climate control or it’s used in a way that’s outside of its recommended parameters, it can lead to sudden failure. Maintenance catches these issues before they disrupt your infrastructure.
- Reduces cybersecurity risks: Cyber threats can change overnight. Outdated software and firmware represent prime targets for cyber criminals. Routine upgrades patch vulnerabilities and limit the opportunities for data breaches.
- Optimizes performance: The systems can improve over time as you experiment with the right hardware and software combination for your organization. The IT staff also get more familiar with these solutions, which can lead to better optimization.
- Proactively addresses problem areas: Small problems don’t always stay small. If maintenance happens infrequently, then it can lead to costly fixes. By covering these issues ahead of time, you avoid this scenario entirely. Fixes happen in the background and may not lead to any downtime at all.
- Keeps operating expenses low: A better return on investment and choosing the right infrastructure for the company reduces waste in the IT budget. You can use the freed up funds for other important projects.
The Importance of an End-to-End Service Provider
Building your IT infrastructure from the ground up along with ongoing maintenance requires specialized resources. Your current IT team may have their days already filled up with support tickets, deployments, application development, training and other critical job duties. If you pull everyone off of their current projects, then you could disrupt multiple areas of the business.
You can also run into issues with having the right mix of IT specialists. Someone who excels in their current area may not have the expertise to plan and execute a strategic IT infrastructure plan.
A Managed Service Provider, such as Proper Sky, complements your in-house IT team by handling this process from start to finish. They take a ground up approach to ensure that all of your business goals and requirements are considered before any technology is chosen.
Once the IT infrastructure is in place and functioning properly, the service provider shifts into monitoring and maintaining the network to minimize downtime and maximize employee efficiency and productivity.
Your company’s IT infrastructure forms the backbone of your operations. If it doesn’t fit with the organization’s needs or fails to grow with you, then it can hinder your potential for years to come. Strategic IT infrastructure planning gets it done correctly from the start.

When you think of hiring an IT company or your looking for business IT support, “Managed IT Services” may not be the first phrase you think of and with good reason. “Managed Services”, in our professional opinion, has to be one of the most poorly developed concept names on the planet. Even though managed services is used mostly in a technology capacity, the name isn’t really reflective of the service. In this Guide to Managed IT Services, you’ll learn what Managed Services were, what they’ve become and why you should choose a managed services provider for your Philadelphia business today.
Typically, Managed Services are often delivered by an IT Service Provider, or, better yet a “Managed Services Provider” or “MSP”. That doesn’t always have to be the case however. There are waste MSP’s, power MSP’s and even supply chain MSP’s, but most often the term relates to IT functions. In order to understand what an MSP does, it makes sense to take a look at how we got to the MSP model today.
In the past, Fortune 500 companies, like most small businesses, had I.T. equipment like routers and switches and servers that would break too. If Ford’s production line shut down because of a router connected to their supplier, they couldn’t get parts in time. Imagine what that would cost in terms of time, productivity and dollars! There was also no way to know if something broke or was going to break, you learned the internet was down when the production line stopped. Big Business and Government needed a better way.
Enter SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). Manufacturers and developers seeing this need built SNMP into their hardware and software which allowed a few users to quickly and easily control hundreds of devices instead of a few allowing organization scale and support. The concept of Network Monitoring and Management was born. Technicians could see ALL of the log files from all their routers in one location and review errors before a device suddenly stopped. This solved the issue of scale, but problems still remained: Reliability. With SNMP, things still broke. The “Things Break / We Fix It” or “Break/Fix” model was common and needed improvement.
Ford’s primary business is making automobiles, not managing internet connections between their hundreds of locations. Even with the ability to scale, companies realized they needed to outsource to experts, but they also needed a way to control costs and reduce outages. On one hand, keeping a dedicated team for things that might break a few times would cost a fortune and on the other hand, an outage of a single day could blow the IT budget for an entire year. Furthermore, even if they spent all this money to get the network redone with SNMP, they didn’t have the expertise to properly manage it.
Companies needed a way for the Managed Services Provider to feel the pain if something broke and the concept of “Service Level Agreements” was born. Ford would pay to put in these complicated networks, but the MSP would service it, monitor it, and, if there was an outage, promise to fix it within times specified in the contract or else the Service Provider would be on the hook for the service outage, hence the name, “Managed Services”. Other Services were added over time, like Backup and Disaster Recovery, Network Security Services, Server Management, Help Desk and more. It wasn’t just monitoring anymore, it was a bunch of bundled “Services” managed by Service Providers. It’s easy to translate that model to power outages, poor water quality or a Break in the supply chain and how the “managed services” nomenclature makes sense.
As the Managed Services Model matured and made its way downstream, more and more devices and software solutions were developed for servers, computers and even mobile devices to address and scale service delivery and support business units. Applications became more complex, integrated and critical. A suite of tools, called remote monitoring and management tools or “RMM”, that bundled many of the common Managed Services functions like remote support, service monitoring, SNMP, log monitoring, backup control, and scripting and automation controls became commonplace in the enterprise. Crowded markets in the enterprise pushed RMM tools down market and into the smb space and IT support companies were finally able to use these RMM toolsets to take the concept of “managed services” down-market as a service differentiator.
By 2003 Email and File servers were required to be in business. Microsoft, hot on the heels of its incredibly successful Windows 2000 server line releases, introduced Small Business Server 2003, putting the tools of the enterprise within reach of every small business. Finally, any business that wanted to take control of their files, email, VPN, database and even internet browsing, was able to. By 2005, nearly every small business had a line of business application that used to run their business and an email server that could never go down. Servers were now ubiquitous.
The uptime problems of the enterprise now became the challenge of the small and midsize business (SMB). Perhaps more so because for an SMB, a single missed email or prolonged outage could make or break a business. IT support became critical for the SMB. Internal IT became a part of the corporate structure and a key position in all organizational charts.
For medium-sized organizations, hiring an in-house “IT guy” or even a few people meant that he needed to know everything about all your IT Systems, understand the business in-depth, apply business needs to technology outcomes, plan and deliver increasingly complicated IT projects, help everyone with their day to day support issues and also never get sick or take a vacation.
For smaller businesses, hiring an in-house IT expert full-time was far too expensive. But owners still needed boots on the ground to repair things. IT support was typically handled by a “Pro” IT guy that could be called when there was a server outage, virus outbreak, or some critical business system failed and they typically billed by the hour.
The “Pro” was usually self-taught or learned on their day job. If a server crashed, you’d call your IT Guy, and, if he was good, understood the issue, was not working elsewhere AND if the backup was relatively recent, he’d be able to help you get your server and office recovered. If it was in-house IT, they typically spent thousands of dollars on support incidents and days on the phone because they were in over their head and working all night. Ironically, the “Break/Fix” IT Guys that were the worst at keeping things running, made the most money and the “Break/Fix” IT Guys that were good, were too expensive to keep once they learned everything because they realized the IT business was about prevention, not cure.
Even if your IT Team was decent, issues would reappear, backups failed, servers died and viruses infected networks all because customers didn’t want to pay for the IT Guys to ensure that everything was fully operational. Small and medium businesses needed a way to control costs and ensure uptime and Service Providers and consultants needed a way to convince their customers that they needed to spend money on prevention rather than cure.
System outages, which were commonplace in the 90’s and 00’s, were becoming increasingly unacceptable for all businesses, big and small. Email could NOT be down, the EMR could NOT fail and the server that ran the manufacturing line could NOT stop. What the enterprise workforce expected reached the SMB too. While virtualization entered the mainstream with the validation of VMWare and the arrival of Hyper-V in Server 2008, complicated technologies like iSCSI, SAN, Fiber Channel, DAS, NAS, Clustering, High-Availability and Disk-Level backups were suddenly added to the tech arsenal of the small business. That “Break/Fix” IT Guy, or the full-timers that ran IT needed to up their game or businesses needed to outsource. Businesses demanded more.
For many small and medium-sized businesses, hiring a Managed Services Provider was the answer. In the way that many businesses who outsourced their finance roles, outsourcing internal IT became the way for businesses to win. Businesses could hire a team of experts to install complicated hardware and software solutions on their behalf. They could deploy the software quickly and effectively to all of their employees, the MSP could ensure that the servers stayed running, secured and patched. Using RMM toolkits and increasingly sophisticated remote access tools, much of the day to day support could be handled over the phone. In fact, much of the work that needed to be done could be done without even interrupting the user at all! Servers could be monitored by teams 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Because of Service Level Agreements (SLA), the Managed Service Provider was now on the hook to bring the servers back up quickly. For the MSP, since they were paid on a flat fee basis, they could spend their time ensuring that all of the work that they knew really needed done; applying security patches, testing and verifying updates, ensuring backup and DR was working, making sure that firewalls and AV were secured and up-to-date was. No more walking into a client environment to find the backup failed, the AV was no longer up to date, or the server hadn’t been patched in a year. Always Available Managed IT Support could now work with Always-On Systems.
By the ‘teens it was nearly impossible to find an established business that DID NOT have a server in an office somewhere. Software and Application vendors, however, frustrated with working with so many customers that wouldn’t pay for support contracts and saddled with managing so many varied installations, turned to the cloud for their next generation of products. The cloud and its ability to abstract many of the difficult technology concepts like WAN & CDN’s, High-Availability, Provisioned IOPS, Auto-Scaling and Load Balancing combined with the increasing power of the “Mobile Phone” truly brought Software-as-a-Service and the “App” to the masses. Today, we’re in the world of the Hyper-Niche.
Customers no longer want to pay for expensive hardware or deal with long term contracts, they want access to their data all the time, wherever they are, on whatever device they choose. Workers, once tethered to the confines of a corporate office because of the nature of a client server application and the constraints of the VPN, now perform their day to day functions without ever having to step into HQ again. Cloud based products and apps are everywhere, always on and always available. The challenge of availability has been nearly conquered. But as the challenge of availability diminishes, the challenge of security rises.
For many businesses, there will always be a need for a physical location and securing that location. From the security cameras down to the nest thermostat, all run on the network and will fundamentally require increasing complexity, control and segmentation. For other businesses, the challenges of regulation, PCI, HIPAA, SOX, FINRA, ISO 27000 compliance, and even the NIST Cybersecurity Framework will need to be systematically applied to not just one or two applications, but to dozens. The power of machine learning will be applied to effectively and systematically to exploit your people through spear phishing, voice spoofing, and ransomware. Custom Exploits-as-a-Service will allow perpetrators to attack organizations ad-hoc and as the cost of these tools get cheaper and cheaper, small and midsize businesses will be targeted more and more.
The consolidation of cloud based applications into fewer and fewer infrastructure vendors, combined with an explosion of Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices and client endpoints means that security, through ensuring availability, will be the domain of the Modern Managed Services Provider. This change won’t happen overnight, but the wheels are in motion. Now is the time to prepare.
We’re in a hybrid world right now. Some customers spent a lot of money building out an advanced internal infrastructure. File, Printer, Network Access Controls and many Legacy applications still reside in customers offices and have better features and controls than their cloud counterparts. While many legacy applications and custom-built software is being superseded by cloud-based, micro-niche solutions, that doesn’t mean everything is cloud ready.
There are decades of legacy data that resides on equipment that is way beyond End of Life and either cannot or should not be upgraded. Yes, technological debt is coming due but bandwidth still isn’t enough for many systems, like security cameras, image processing, CAD and video generation. Some systems, like security and access control, assembly line operations, and even business decision systems should probably not even be connected to the cloud at all.
So what does this mean for the Modern MSP and your business today? It means you need a partner that can straddle the history of technology legacy AND prepare your enterprise for the security and compliance challenges of the future. We see 7 key areas that the modern managed services provider must excel in to meet the risk and uncertainty of the business of tomorrow: Security, Strategy, Infrastructure, Communications & Interoperability, Business Continuity, Training & Compliance and Support. You’ll need not just a Managed Services Provider, but a Technology Solutions Provider. A team of people that assemble and secure all of these components in a meaningful way, and can provide a technology solutions “stack” that exceeds the needs of your enterprise.
Ginni Rometty, president, chair and CEO of IBM said famously “cyber-crime is the greatest threat to every company in the world” and for good reason. At Proper Sky, we believe that security should be the underpinning of most, if not all, executive decision making when it comes to systems and processes. Sacrificing security for freedom and cost-saving is unaffordable. The right people looking at the right data at the right time, all the time. As we add more and more systems, become more and more geographically dispersed, and the ‘simplicity’ of apps continues to conceal their sophistication, enterprise security will be THE bench mark that separates the winners from the losers in the coming decades. When you’re small, the cost of a cyber event – both in real dollars and in broken trust with your customers – can be devastating. According to Symantec & Inc Magazine up to 60% of small businesses fail within 6 months of a Cyberattack. And a full 22% of small and medium businesses cease operations IMMEDIATELY after a ransomware infection. Security is no longer an enterprise concern.
Locking everything down behind a firewall, in your office, on your server is no longer the strategy. As an Executive, you’ll need to think about how to secure the payload that attackers want, and then build the walls that protect them. It’s no longer a case of IF there is a breach, but WHEN. Security today goes well beyond the old. The concepts of prevention, while still valid, need to be supported by Incident Detection and Response. Executives will need their IT departments to consider an entire suite of security solutions that form the basis for a 21st century security architecture: Advanced Endpoint Security, Malware & Security Protection, Application Control, DNS Web Filtering, Security Policies, Identity and Access Management, Single Sign-On, Two-Factor Authentication, Security Information Event Management, Certificate Management, Unified Threat Management, Web Content Filtering, Surveillance & Access Control and much, much more. The breadth of these solutions can be staggering.
Finally, now that you have these controls in place, how will you test them? One of the lessons that the world continually teaches technology providers and application developers is that security isn’t a one time thing. It requires constant vigilance and rapid action. Changes need to be documented, endpoints need to be secured and patched, servers, firewalls and networks need to be scanned. The risks on your risk assessment, need to be addressed. Security doesn’t just happen on ‘patch Tuesday’. The Modern MSP considers security and reality to be the foundation of good strategy.
Security should be a core consideration for all businesses, but as a business owner, where do you start? Every business is unique and there is no silver bullet. However, just because there isn’t a simple solution doesn’t mean that one can’t be built for your business. A modern MSP works with executives to identify and translate their vision and business objectives into a series of actionable steps that can reduce an organization’s technological and security posture, increase productivity and save money.
The modern MSP works as a partner for your organization. In the traditional model, businesses looked to technicians as “technical plumbers”, resources to deploy in the event of a “tech leak.” These were not true partners. As your business grows and your technology needs increase, however, you need a partner that can put all of the pieces of your business, the ones that depend on technology, together in a way that maximizes your investments in people, processes and tools.
How do you get the data from the CRM to integrate with your Ordering System AND keep them running? How do you track the performance of your marketing platform with the new appointment reminder system for your patients? How much does a single no-show cost you or what does a single missed phone call mean for revenue? Can your MSP put this together? If not, they’ll need to.
As Executives add more and more solutions to their “stack”, they’ll need increasingly sophisticated partners that can not only secure access to those applications but integrate them all together in a meaningful way. Today’s MSP’s will look at not only increasing security and maximizing productivity and uptime, but they’ll be depended on to provide information that will help companies drive business decisions. Businesses will need Managed Service Providers to help “glue” their systems together, and to integrate services that can help small businesses both leverage their investments in technology and provide a competitive advantage over their peers.
So how does the Modern MSP approach infrastructure? Legacy and On-Premise availability is much the same. Every business will continue to need more and more switches, routers, firewalls, printers, phones, access points, tablets, printers, computers and more. As businesses however, you’ll come to expect more from your infrastructure. Security will be an underpinning of the modern business network. The expensive and complicated world of the MPLS gives way to the Software-Defined WAN. An MSP will help make your internet faster, more reliable and cheaper while providing increasingly sophisticated network-segmentation, access control and monitoring.
At Proper Sky, we believe that ALL systems that have legacy data and can be moved to the cloud, should be. Cloud service providers like AWS, Microsoft’s Azure and Google Cloud Platform offer resiliency, security, protection and business continuity that small businesses could only dream of years ago. In a hybrid world, businesses that have critical systems that cannot be moved to cloud will need partners that can monitor, secure and isolate those systems while making them as highly available as possible.
Finally, Managed Service Providers will rely increasingly on sophisticated network segmentation that provides things like employee phone browsing on the corporate network while making sure that your network won’t be hacked by an internet connected fish tank or a compromised NestCam. Even small networks will become increasingly sophisticated as more and more Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices get connected to your corporate networks. The modern MSP will know how to make crucial systems available and secure and the less important ones isolated and relegated.
As your business grows and the internet matures, the breadth and width of available solutions will continue to expand while the quality and complexity of cloud based systems will continue to expand. Just look at Office 365. In 2011, the first version of Office 365, we had an online version of Exchange, SharePoint and Lync. In 2019, with the release of “Microsoft 365”, businesses now have access to Exchange, SharePoint, Skype, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, Teams, Publisher, OneNote, Yammer, Project, Visio, PowerBI, Forms, Sway, OneDrive, StaffHubs, Azure AD, Microsoft Intune, Mobile Device Management, Azure Rights Management, Windows Virtual Desktop and more. And while this list addresses Email and a number of productivity tools, it does not address Spam, Phishing & Security Filtering, Email Archiving & Compliance, and Email Backup. And that’s “just email”.
Add text messaging, Voice-Over-IP and modern telephone systems, teleconferencing solutions, webex, your file sharing tools, team collaboration and chat software, social media, password management, and bring your own device and we’re just about warmed up with the end user. Now add your line of business applications, your CRM, ERP, your marketing tools, your EHR, your accounting package, your time tracking system, your payroll system and the list begins to pile up. Who will manage it all? How will you know when you let your employees go, you really, truly “got it all”? The modern MSP will be able to help you get a handle on the multiple silos of data you have spread around the Internet and help ensure that the right people have access to the right systems and data at the right time. From biometric fingerprint scanners to a seamless offboarding experience, we provide processes, tools, systems and solutions that get it all working together as seamlessly as possible.
In the past, equipment failure, prolonged outages. Natural disasters and an occasional virus are what backup was designed to address in the past, but the world has changed. What would it cost your organization if you walked in one day and everyone’s computers were encrypted? Or the server that runs your order processing system were down for 4 days and hackers wanted 50K to get it running? How would your customers feel if they couldn’t email you for a week? As an owner, when you look at your organization, it’s important to think about technology as not just a revenue enabler but also as a significant risk. Cyberattacks, breaches and IP theft aren’t just “geek problems”, they’re the stuff of nightmares. 58% of malware attack victims were small businesses and Cyber Attacks cost SMB’s an average of $2.2M! Business continuity and disaster recovery take on a whole new meaning in the world of ransomware.
While the cloud presents amazing opportunities for off-site backup, cloud based applications and more, the cloud can’t solve everything. Most businesses aren’t even aware that Microsoft doesn’t backup their mailboxes or calendars. Even Office 365 can be encrypted “in the cloud” and just because a vendor is cloud based, doesn’t mean they aren’t susceptible to the same attacks either.
Today, MSP’s take the principles of the Cybersecurity Framework, HIPAA Risk Assessment, SOC II and work with you and your business to create real, practical and straight-forward backup and disaster recovery plans for not only the old physical threats of availability and outages, but the new world of cybersecurity threats and cloud scale. The results of a well-conceived and tested business continuity plan considers the inevitability of a breach, non-technical workarounds, independent software solutions and whatever else your business needs to ensure that you’re the 40% that makes it beyond the inevitable.
While there is no doubt a mystique when someone mentions the word “hacker”, it doesn’t take magic to hack a system, as a simple email will do. In the 2018 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) 88 of 99 breaches involved an email. At Proper Sky, we believe one of the transformative changes you’ll see from the Traditional MSP to the Modern MSP is the shift from just securing systems to actually training end users. People are an organization’s weakest link. No matter how good your perimeter systems and spam filtering solutions are, threats will evolve and people will be the target for overriding your safeguards. Technology Service Providers will help validate, test and train your people so that they not only understand the risks that are involved but to ensure the integrity of your safe guards.
The Modern MSP will provide Dark Web monitoring and automate testing for weak and easily compromised passwords. We’re going to see phishing and credential sharing tested randomly and employees scored, trained and counseled, not by HR but by IT. There will be increasing sophisticated Office “Lures” sent from legitimate peers that can convince users to enable macros. As we’re already seeing in auditing, account controls, adherence to policies and procedures, training users to verify who is on the phone and more, it’s becoming clearer and clearer that we’ll be seeing IT take a bigger role in training employees how to safeguard themselves and the organization’s assets.
Also, industries that have been lightly regulated in the past, can expect more in the future. HIPAA, PCI, SOX, GDPR, DFARS and FINRA will trickle further downstream to suppliers, supply chains and manufacturers. With increasing regulation and complexity, businesses will need to lean on IT as not only their technical counterpart, but to be there to help prepare their workforce for the technical and legal challenges they’re likely to face and to continually guide them through their risk assessments as well as implementing best practices. The Modern MSP will be your partner in Training, Compliance, and Policies & Procedures.
And while the world continues to change, some things never will: computers won’t boot; printers will jam; files will “disappear”; and powerpoint will never display properly on a Mac. The foundational component of all good MSP’s will continue as it always has… a phone call or ticket with the Help Desk and an empathetic person on the other end. As much as we want technology to be a panacea for all your business ails, you’re going to need support.
Gone are the days of calling up a monolithic support desk to have your issues “queued” and handled at the “first availability.” The real world depends on real-time solutions. Help Desk will be customer focused, results driven and the life-blood of a good IT department. Support won’t just be about tech nerds solving problems, it’ll be about getting your issue resolved as quickly as possible on your terms. In the world of the always on, the Modern MSP will resolve your problems in real-time, quickly and happily.
But being quick and happy doesn’t mean that there isn’t room for process and best practices either. By outsourcing to a Modern Managed Services Provider’s help desk, you instantly attain process, control, documentation and accountability that almost no internal team can replicate. The modern MSP is an organization that lives and breathes process and technology, when you combine these forces with an exceptional customer support experience, your business is strengthened.
In a nutshell, Managed IT Services provide the following benefits for organizations, both large and small:
- Longevity: The tech your company uses should not only be considered when it breaks down. It should be supported and cultivated, so there aren’t any breakdowns in the first place. Supporting technological longevity is what Managed IT Services do best.
- Scalability: MSPs understand that scalability is important. The ability to scale up or down and having the cloud-based infrastructure that allows you to expand or downsize is crucial. At Proper Sky, for example, we apply blue-sky thinking to the cloud, so your business can adapt swiftly.
- Efficiency: You want to maximize uptime. You don’t want to have to deal with IT problems. You want to be satisfied. MSPs are designed to want this for you too – and can deliver it. ASAP.
- Compliance: For your business to be operational, you must be compliant with tech-related rules and regulations set by various governing bodies. Don’t worry about the administrative details, an MSP with compliance expertise will have you covered. From HIPAA compliance certificates to licenses with vendors such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, an MSP is equipped with the right documentation for your upgraded tech.
- Alignment: The right MSP will deliver true value to your partnership, and will provide you with a comprehensive, best-fit plan which aligns best practices to your vision.
- More for Less: You simply get more for less. You get a team of IT professionals supporting your business at all times for one, low monthly fee. Often, for less than the cost of a single-salaried employee, you get a team of experts with years of industry experience and practical knowledge on helping businesses thrive.
Every company has an accountant. Every company has an insurance broker. All companies need an IT partner. The technological landscape evolves so rapidly – and regularly, too – that knowing you have a supportive and attuned team behind you will ease the stress of running a business. We’re technological liability mitigators. Our goals are inherently aligned with yours.
Hiring an MSP like Proper Sky is all about reducing risk. At the core of what we offer as a Managed Service Provider is assurance – as well as insurance.
In terms of implementation, we proactively address business risk by creating a tailored plan to minimize failure. We do this by going into clients’ offices and looking at the current technological infrastructure, and analyzing what improvements could be made. Afterward, we upgrade computer networks, servers, operating systems, and the physical tech your employees use on a daily basis. Not only does this increase productivity output, but it’s also financially cost-effective. By swapping your one in-house IT worker for our remote team, we can make beneficial use of your tech budget, actually saving you money along the way.
As a small business ourselves, we relate to the financial triumphs and tribulations with running an enterprise, and understand the hidden costs involved behind every decision. It may be comforting to learn that Proper Sky always has been – and always will be – versatile when it comes to our clients’ budgets. We endeavor to make things work, no matter how constrained or relaxed your tech allowance is.
The financial advantages do not end there. The MSP financial model is also inherently superior: the old break-fix model of recent history demanded money from you – the client – on a constant basis. Cash was shelled out to first implement state-of-the-art tech and then again whenever there was a problem, no matter how minor or major. But, for a negotiated monthly fee, you will be saving money and your company at the same time. We don’t clean up the mess after a disaster has happened. By constant monitoring, we prevent disasters from happening in the first place.
Managed IT Service Providers typically offer a wide array of solutions which fall under the IT Services umbrella. These solutions include:
- IT Infrastructure Design & Maintenance: Your IT infrastructure is comprised of the computers, network switches, and both onsite or cloud-based servers and data storage. How well that infrastructure is designed, installed, configured, and maintained plays an important role in how your business functions on a daily basis, as well as the opportunities for scaling in the future. For a deep dive into this subject and how an MSP can help, please see our guide on IT Infrastructure Design and Installation.
- Business Continuity: The concept of Business Continuity seeks to proactively address issues before they materialize into business disruptions. Disruptions can include a network crash, cyber attack, or equipment failure. It’s a concept that has replaced the old term, “backup and disaster recovery.” To learn more about Business Continuity and how an MSP can assist, please see our Guide to Business Continuity.
- Cloud Computing: Cloud Computing opens up significant potential for companies looking to do more with their technology. Some of the biggest advantages to bringing in cloud-based solutions is improving team collaboration, and being able to accomplish work at anytime, anywhere on a secure cloud-based server. For more information on Cloud Computing and how an MSP can help you utilize it, see our Guide to Cloud Computing.
- Help Desk Support: A Help Desk is a remote team of IT professionals who are available to assist your staff with any issues on a day-to-day basis. Help Desks offer support for your employees so they are able to get to work quicker, without pulling time and resources from your management team who may not be experts on any particular aspect of your technology. For more information on how a Help Desk can support your [LINK NEEDED] business, please see our article, “How Help Desk Support Increases Productivity.”
- Cybersecurity and Compliance: Having a cybersecurity plan is absolutely necessary in a day and age in which small and medium-sized businesses are being targeted by cyber criminals more than ever. A cyber attack can halt business operations and lead to losses, both terms of data and financial penalties from compliance authorities. Hacking, ransomware, malware, and viruses are among the risks that your business faces. An MSP can help protect you against these threats, while training your employees on best practices against social engineering threats like phishing. Learn more about cybersecurity for your business and how an MSP can help by reading our article, “An MSPs Guide to Cyber Security.”
While implementing any one of these elements of IT into your business can certainly help, if they are not implemented with respect to an overall IT Strategy, the results may be less than stellar – potentially leading to less efficiency, higher costs, and more headaches.
For instance, when providing Managed IT Services for a Philadelphia based non-profit, we were able to save them $50,000 in one-time fees and over $275,000 a year in wasted technology spend. In real terms, we were able to save 1.6% of the total expenses for a $20M company by simply reviewing their vendor agreements and moving them to more cost effective solutions. IT isn’t about bits and bytes, it can really drive down costs in a meaningful way.
An IT strategy prepared by an MSP will provide coherence between all the different elements of an organization’s IT, along with the proper documented plans & procedures which:
- Provide efficient problem resolution when issues arise, and;
- Define a clear set of objectives for each element for accomplishing overall business goals.
An MSP can put together a cohesive IT strategy that will help you align technology with your business’ goals, while reducing redundancy and unnecessary costs. The process that an MSP will go through to build your IT strategy will go something like this:
- Initial Meetings: The first step in building an IT Strategy are meetings between high-level decision makers of your company and the MSP’s team. During these meetings, the MSP will provide you with more information about themselves, ask questions about how you deal with technology today, and determine a path to get you on track with your business goals.
- Strategic Development: Once the MSP has a clear understanding of your technology needs and business goals, they’ll work with their team to develop a roadmap to improving operational efficiency and productivity, strategize your technology to align with your business goals, and create a detailed financial plan to manage it all.
- Strategy Implementation: Once the strategic plan has been developed, the MSP’s team of IT professionals will implement short and long-term plans as your full-time IT department for a fixed, monthly fee. Your infrastructure will be maintained and monitored, as well as upgraded regularly for cutting-edge performance.
Every MSP will have their own process of building an IT Strategy. However, if they’re doing it right, it will follow the general path outlined above. Your business’ strategic plan will need to be unique and will reflect the technology needs and goals of your business. There is no “one-size-fits-all” approach to IT strategy. As your business goals evolve, your strategy will need to evolve with it. When goals change, an MSP will take a similar path towards updating the strategy.
As previously noted, Managed IT Services are based on a Service Level Agreement, or SLA. The SLA is a contractual agreement between you and the MSP and will detail the quality, availability and responsibilities of the services within the agreement. SLAs typically range in cost based on the number of employees, the number of devices, the complexity of systems, and the scope of services within the agreement. Each MSP can structure their solutions a bit differently, but you can usually expect to spend anywhere from $50+ per device or user for basic security only agreements to $150 or more for fully-managed agreements.
For a better understanding of your costs for Managed IT Services, you’ll need to talk with an MSP about your organization’s make up, and the goals you’re looking to accomplish with technology.
Perhaps you’ve seen the acronym ‘MSP’ floating around on the internet in recent years. The reason why so many companies want to collaborate with a Managed Service Provider is due to it being financially taxing to sit an IT employee in a chair, all year long, only to respond to unforeseeable emergencies. The payroll often doesn’t match up to their efforts. In layman’s terms, it’s simply more cost-effective to partner with an MSP.
But the majority of new MSPs – and there are a lot of new kids on the block – don’t quite understand what being an MSP actually entails. A Managed Service Provider, at its core, is a prevention business – securing a company’s digital side – and not just a way for the MSP in question to recoup costs. There’s an incredibly fast turnover with MSP businesses. But as with all ventures, quality prevails and the strong survive.
Our ethos revolves around excellence. That’s why Proper Sky, a Managed Service provider in Philadelphia, are champions of Managed IT Services. We work proactively, rather than retroactively, and pride ourselves on our longevity – and helping our collaborators grow alongside us. After being a Managed Service Provider for over a decade, we have many tricks up our sleeves that start-up MSPs simply haven’t discovered.
Your Next Steps…
Stellar performance isn’t a privilege – it’s a requirement. The fast-paced world of contemporary business in cities like Philadelphia requires a company’s technology to be running at optimal capacity around the clock. Even a minute wasted can ultimately result in a loss of employee productivity and financial transactions, rendering your business disadvantaged. Avoid disruption and downtime with a problem-free network, implemented and monitored by the stalwart team employed here at Proper Sky.

https://propersky.com/myfitnesspal-data-breach/,"MyFitnessPal Data Breach
A Password is a Password is a Password
When I woke up this morning and checked the news, I read that MyFitnessPal was hacked and that they lost 150 Million passwords! It’s not yahoo, but that’s a lot.
My wife and I are both MyFitnessPal users so when I told her, her first reaction was “Great! Now hackers can see what I ate for lunch yesterday.” That’s probably a pretty normal reaction. I think what my wife and most people fail to realize is that the problem isn’t the hack of MyFitnessPal per se, but rather it’s the fact that the password she uses on MyFitnessPal could be copied and used to access much more important websites like WellsFargo bank or an investment account at Schwab.
- The first and best thing we suggest is to turn on something called Two Factor Authentication everywhere you can. We use the google authenticator application every day but text messaging is just as good. You see this with banks all the time, you put in your password then they text you a 6 or 8 digit number and you enter that and you can access your account. Do this wherever you can.
- The other thing to do is to get a Password Manager and use random long passwords whenever you can. Here’s a recent review of some free ones. We use KeePass and LastPass in some situations. At Proper Sky, we’re using a third party tool rather than consumer password managers.
- And last but not least, always keep your email and banking passwords different from any casual shopping site. Your amazon password should NOT be your Citizens Bank password and your banking password should NEVER be your Gmail password. Email is a gateway to password recovery so it needs to be locked up extra, extra tight.
So some good news, is that MyFitnessPal used an encryption type known as ‘bcrypt” which is actually a very good password algorithm. It takes your password, adds a really long complicated string called a salt, then it changes a value on a regular basis which makes the salt change AND then if you keep trying to remember your password, it makes you wait longer and longer each try you try to find it. While all of these things are great in theory, they’re not foolproof. The infamous Ashley Madison hack used the same algorithm except their source code was leaked and they were able to reverse engineer the salt plus the programmers didn’t write the best code.
This will be a problem for a long time until they really figure out biometrics but for now, use different, long passwords, turn on 2FA and segment your passwords!

https://propersky.com/office-365-vs-g-suite-when-your-using-macs/,"Office 365 vs. G-Suite in a Mac or Mac/Windows Office Environment
While they primarily deal with email, Office 365 and G-Suite have become much, much more than just email. In this article, we’re going to be comparing 2 key products within these application suites: Microsoft 365 (which is different than Office 365) and G Suite Business Edition when it comes to using them in a all Mac or Windows/Mac hybrid office environment. These are the two most similar product offerings so it makes sense to make them the basis for our comparison.
There are some key things to consider when we’re talking about each of these:
- Identity Management – The best and easiest way to think about this is the “log in with your Google Account” or the “Log in with your Microsoft 365 Account”. This is essentially identity management. Both Microsoft and Google want to control Identity and Authentication Management (IAM).
- Email Features – You know both of these products well. Google and Microsoft are very competitive in this space. Microsoft is better for dealing with a GUI front end but Gmail does web based like no one else on the planet.
- Software – Google Sheets, Docs, Forms etc. Vs. Word, Excel, Outlook, Flow Microsoft has a full suite of desktop software that Google will probably never be able to compete with and it’s the defacto standard for all document editing
- Collaboration Tools – Skype vs. Hangouts vs. Duo vs. Lync vs. Hangouts vs. Teams vs Slack. And the million in-betweens that connect them.
- Security and Mobile & Desktop Features & Tools – This is how G Suite and Microsoft handle managing mobile phones, laptops and other devices based on Mac, PC, iOS, Android, etc.
- Other things to consider – Advanced Threat Protection, Slack, Meeting Software, Versioning, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams
Licenses We’ll Use
Microsoft recently released a product line called “Microsoft 365” which is an advanced bundle of SKU’s for services that used to cost a fortune. Generally speaking, it includes: Office 365 Email, One Drive for File Storage, Azure Active Directory (IAM), Office 2019, Intune for Managing Phones & Desktops, SharePoint, Advanced Threat Protection, free upgrade to Windows 10 and some kickers. For non profit’s if $7.60/user (up to 300 users). For Businesses it’s $20/mo.
With G Suite Business, you get what you know and love, you get Gmail for business, Google Drive, Google Documents (Docs, Sheets, Slides with Built-In web collaboration), Google Login (IAM), G Suite MDM and Advanced Android Deployment Tools, Sites, Vault Email Retention (Non-Profit Special Pricing). The Non-Profit edition is free but we recommend you add on the Vault service for keeping historical version of email and / or for any Compliance or Discovery searches that result from lawsuits. Vault is the big differentiator, you have to get pricing from google by filling out their form online.
Our General Guidance
When we look to decide what’s going to be the right fit for an organization we generally look at a few things:
- Does everyone in the company use Outlook?
- Does everyone in the company have Windows?
- Is SharePoint and/or Exchange institutionalized?
If the answer to any of these questions is “Yes”, we don’t even really look at G Suite as an option. If we find an organization that makes heavy use of SharePoint, Outlook or Windows 10, the move to another system can be pretty difficult and the labor isn’t worth the effort. It’s easier to fix or improve what they have than it is to switch.
But if this isn’t the case, here’s some key differences…
Identity & Access Management (IAM)
The best way to describe Identity Management is to use the Image below. There are many third-party web systems that tie into both Office 365 as an authentication system and Google as an authentication system. We would argue that while the user experience with Google is better, Outlook has become much improved. Outlook also uses Active Directory as a backend which is a well-known, well-documented system.
The most important thing to know about Identity Management is that each IAM system will allow you to log into other third-party systems. Users will be able to log into ADP, Slack, Zoom.us, etc. using just their Google or Office 365 Login.
With Windows 10, you can use your Office 365 email account to log into your windows 10 computer. With a couple of tools (JAMF and Intune), you can do the same thing with Macs as well. You cannot do this with G Suite as they don’t offer native authentication integration.
You can log into Office 365 on this screen:
You can login into Office 365 on the Mac Screen. G Suite can’t do this.
Advantage: Tie (Better UX for Google, Desktop Support for MSFT)
Email Features
This is going to be a controversial discussion, but we use G Suite internally at Proper Sky and we have and Support Office 365 installations as well. Everyone on the team would probably have a different opinion on this but we’ll summarize the key points as succinctly as we can.
- Google is significantly better at blocking spam, stopping phishing attacks and protecting users out of the box. Like way better. Microsoft has better third party security options. If you want to use Office 365, we’re going to buy a third-party security product. Case in point, a phishing email in Office 365:
We literally have to jump through hoops to get that “this message seems dangerous” link to even show up in a G Suite mailbox. We have seen two wire transfers in just the last couple of weeks come through Office 365 that could have been stopped with some better warnings and wouldn’t even forward to our G Suite account.
- If your users use the web interface, G Suite’s search function is second to none. Most of our clients have large mailboxes and simply typing “from:@domain.org in:all” in the search bar will return every email ever sent to domain.org in every folder. If you are a heavy mailbox searcher and you use the web interface G Suite is SIGNIFICANTLY better. Outlook uses the built in windows indexer and isn’t as good.
- G Suite is way better on Android Phones. Office 365 is about the same on Android and iPhone. We actually prefer the Outlook App for iPhones and Androids rather than the built in calendar and contact syncing. However if everyone is using iPhones, it’s a wash.
- G Suite can be used with Microsoft Outlook, but we have some occasional issues with syncing the clients. It’s not a big deal but about once a year, you’ll have 3 or 4 days where you get an innocuous error message with syncing your contacts or calendar via outlook when you are a native G Suite user. Outlook works pretty much perfectly with Office 365 once it’s setup. Overall though the experience with G-Suite and Outlook is very positive.
- Office 365 is much easier to manage. Many of the quasi-routine tasks that we go through; permissions to mailboxes, turning users on and off, sharing mailboxes, shared calendars, read-only lists, etc. Outlook and Office 365 are much better at. G Suite cannot do much of the advanced stuff Outlook & Office 365 can. If you have a lot of advanced sharing and one-off functions, Office 365 is better.
Advantage: Depends. Google as an End User, Office 365 as an Admin or Heavy Outlook End User
Software
With the Microsoft 365 License, you get all of the heavy hitters: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote & Access as part of the license. All of Google’s solutions require that you use their online versions: Docs, Sheets, Slides, Keep & App Maker. If you want native Word & Excel, we have to put copies for each employee, it’s roughly an additional $5/employee/mo.
One other key point where we’d recommend using Office 365: If you do a LOT of collaborative Word & Excel editing. If you have multiple people sharing documents back and forth for edits, updates, versions and tracking, SharePoint is going to be the solution we recommend just because that’s what it’s designed for.
If you use file editing and versioning lightly, Google Drive recently added native .docx and .xlsx file sharing and editing but it’s just out of beta so we’re not exactly sure how reliable the system is yet. The feature is there and it’s available but if you submit native word docs as part of your daily output, SharePoint and Microsoft Teams are the way to go.
Advantage: Microsoft. Office 365 is still superior to G Suite Online Versions. G Suite’s online versions kick MSFT’s butt though.
Collaboration Tools
One Drive vs. Google Drive File Stream. One of the most important considerations in the Google vs. Microsoft Debate can be broken down in minute detail here, but here’s what we think of the two tools: Both tools are file server replacements and both will serve your requirements well. Google is more polished and definitely plays better with Macs.
One Drive has a much tighter integration with SharePoint, you can quickly sync SharePoint and Team libraries to your local PC in a single click. Both tools keep most of your content on the cloud and “stream it” (play it like a remote screen) while you download the actual file. Both tools allow you to select which files you want to keep on your local computer for sync if you’re flying or traveling. Both have nice iPhone & Android Apps. Google has the concept of “Team Shares” which are shares for folks that are part of a team (think Finance, Operations, Legal, etc.), while Microsoft uses the name “Teams” but it’s implementation is slightly different. And both accounts segment out your personal share vs. your team share pretty well.
Google requires that any file that you share with someone else is either globally public or they have a Google account in order to login. Microsoft will allow you to share files for editing with Non-Microsoft account users which is nice. Microsoft One Drive also has something called “Data Leak Prevention” which prevents users from opening files outside of where they have access. For example if a user tried to copy a file from their work PC to a home PC to edit it, the home PC wouldn’t be able to. Right now the parts are rudimentary but the features are coming along.
For Team collaboration, we’re going to preface this with one Major condition: If you use Slack, you’re going to have a hard time leaving it. We use Slack and LOVE IT. It has transformed the way we communicate with our internal team the way we share files, collect feedback, track web leads, share policy etc. If you have Slack in your organization, you may find that G Suite’s Hangout and Microsoft Teams are not nearly as good of a fit and that the money spent on Slack is worth it. We can set Slack up so that you can use your Google or Office 365 Login rather than having a separate login, which makes provisioning and terminating employees easier. But if you have Slack, you’re driving a Bentley already.
Microsoft recently released a “Slack Killer” called Microsoft Teams. It’s built into all versions of Office 365 (Business) and, if you are coming from nothing, it’s a very well designed and very solid product. Google has a roughly equivalent offering called “Hangouts Chat” that is improving rapidly, but we would argue it’s not as good as Microsoft Teams and both are inferior to Slack. If monthly costs are an issue, either one will serve in a “good enough capacity” and are superior to nothing at all.
The other collaboration tools that we need to consider are Skype (which ties into Slack) and Google Voice / Google Hangouts which is designed for doing screensharing. We would argue that while Skype is a solid product with a strong brand and good technical chops, Microsoft has made organizing web meetings with it very, very difficult. The interface is kludgy and hard to control. Google Hangouts, on the other hand while incredibly simple, most organizations don’t find the feature set rich enough.
Telephony in both the G Suite service and the Office 365 Service are just so-so. They’ll improve in time, but they’re not worth really discussing as is.
And of course, sending calendar invites is one of the places where outlook really, really shines. It’s world class. Google Calendar is great but Outlook is the reigning champ.
Advantage: Google Drive for Files (but close). If you don’t have Slack, Teams for Collaboration, Hangouts for Conferencing. Outlook scheduling is world class.
Security and Mobile & Desktop Features & Tools
Generally speaking, Microsoft is designed for the laptop / desktop world, while Google is built around the concept of mobile first. Microsoft has been working with enterprise endpoints for decades and approaches many of it’s features with an eye towards making that feature manageable centrally. Google is more about controlling access to the information itself and while the difference is subtle it means a lot for end users. Google doesn’t generally build full software applications unless they tie into some sort of cloud offering where Microsoft considers the Operating Systems in most of its designs. It’s just in it’s DNA.
Microsoft 365 comes with some desktop management tools while Google comes with iPhone / Android mobile device management features. From an Administration perspective, if we’re forgoing remote management, Google and Microsoft are functionally equivalent. We can make sure that 2 factor authentication is on, that phones require passwords, that we can wipe them remotely if they’re stolen, we can lock people out of accounts and we can find phones if they’re lost (maybe). There’s some extra features for G Suite users on Android but that’s basically it. Office 365, specifically Intune, allows us to control much more on the windows PC side, but very little on the Mac side.
Advantage: Tie. Both will perform the minimum necessary functions for remote devices. Microsoft wins if it’s completely a windows eco-system.
Summary / Other Things to Consider
Right now, we’re amid an Arm’s race between G Suite and Microsoft. Both systems are excellently engineered and have their own set of strengths and weaknesses. It is important to really think about the long term strategy of the organization because it’s easier to get this right the first time. However, you can always move from one system to the other with some help in the future so this isn’t a permanent decision.
Google Engineers can get a MacBook or a Linux box. They don’t use Windows at all. Because of that, Google spends a lot of development time making their stuff work on Mac’s and Linux. Microsoft has committed to making Office a great product on Mac’s but they don’t own the OS like the do with Windows so it’s going to be as good as it can be with what they have. Macs will always support both but Google will do better testing on Mac’s vs. Windows in our humble opinion.
Google’s User Experience design is way ahead of Microsoft’s. Google really considers how the user uses their product while Microsoft has more of an engineering / developer perspective. Google’s design tends to be intuitive, Microsoft’s tends to include the most functions for business.
We recently had an internal discussion of moving our G Suite setup for Proper Sky and to move to Office 365 but opted not to. For most organizations if, you’re going to be mostly Mac but definitely hybrid, you don’t have SharePoint hanging over your head and ease of use is more important than central administration, we’d recommend you go with G Suite.
Summary: While both systems are great, if you’re Mac first, G Suite will make the most sense and provide the best solution. But they’re so close now, you can’t go wrong.

https://propersky.com/passwords-101-use-protection/,"Passwords 101: Use Protection!
Passwords are the technological locks to sensitive patient information like full names, dates of birth, current addresses, phone numbers and medical records. Because of their ties to patients’ delicate information, your passwords should always be HIPAA compliant. You may think you know what makes for a secure password, but the truth could surprise you.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology — the people who set scientific standards like the exact length of an inch and the specific recipe for standard peanut butter — have also set the standard for secure passwords. And, out of everyone, NIST should know these kinds of details: they’ve created specs for even the US government to abide by. Their knowledge on this particular topic is second-to-none. We’ve incorporated their know-how into our professional practices, which include:
Try to aim for 12-13 characters.
Each character is adding an extra layer of security, making it harder and harder for passwords to be discovered by brute-force programs. We believe a resilient password contains both letters and other characters – like numbers or punctuation – to ensure that isn’t crackable.
Jumble characters around.
‘Password1’ is a terrible password, and nobody should use it. Ever. But putting the ‘1’ halfway through instead of at the end is one way to make the password a little more cryptic. Think about putting numerical characters in between letters or words in your passwords, creating a real sense of differentiation.
Use a long, but memorable password.
Our own research has uncovered that extremely long and complicated passwords sometimes create more problems than solutions. If an employee writes down their password on a post-it and sticks it to their monitor or laptop screen, their password is exposed for everybody to see. This is a security breach — plain and simple. We highly suggest using a sturdy but memorable password instead of randomized, generated one that’ll be forgotten or written down.
Change your approach of reviewing security.
NIST also recommends changing strong passwords less frequently and scheduling regular administrative reviews instead of changing passwords on a routine basis. Every quarter, hold reviews to ensure users aren’t accessing files they shouldn’t be, and that accounts aren’t doing strange and suspicious things on a network. Not only is this method highly practical, but it works wonders when it comes to security, too.
Even though passwords are extremely important, they’re just one piece of the puzzle to consider when it comes to online security. Our professional services team can help you develop strong password practices — contact us today.

https://propersky.com/proper-sky-fake-invoices-scam/,"Proper Sky Fake Invoices Scam
How to spot the Fake Proper Sky LLC Invoices
On 10/5/2021 we received several strange requests from people or businesses we have not worked with to delete accounts we didn’t own or refund invoices we didn’t create. Fortunately one of the recipients of this email was kind enough to forward us this email so we could help users identify the fraud. We’re not sure if we should be flattered that we’re being used to scam or furious but here’s how to tell.
First, the email looks something like this:
The scam in this case is to get you to call the 215 phone number at the bottom of the screen. Once you call that number, they’ll tell you that your credit card has been fraudulently used and that they need to remote into your computer to get access to it to “remove the fraud”. Generally these are people with heavy accents working from overseas but not always, English is almost always a second language though, which we dive into below.
The real scam is once they get on your computer, they disable your antivirus and firewall or they encrypt your PC and ultimately demand payment or try to steal credit card information with keyloggers or other nasty software. What better way to do that than to pretend you’re an IT company? Also, since our actual domain, propersky.com has a good reputation, Google & Microsoft’s spam filters are more likely to let these emails get through, which makes us more valuable.
If we look further into this email, there are several dead giveaways that this message is fake.
- Scammers don’t spend money. The biggest tell of all is that the email actually came from a gmail.com address and not a propersky.com address. Sometimes, these values can be spoofed or tricked but in this case, they simply used the Gmail address. They most likely did this because we have some advanced email settings that are designed to prevent emails from looking like they come from propersky.com. IF YOU GET INVOICES FROM GMAIL.COM ADDRESSES YOU SHOULD ALWAYS ASSUME IT’S A SCAM. Any legitimate business will use business email or a third party payment system to send you invoices.
- Scammers are dumb. The invoice number is impossibly long. Most invoices numbers make sense, this is just a random number. We don’t need an 11 character invoice number. They don’t care about nuance.
- Scammers are lazy. In the email above you’ll notice that they didn’t bother to change the dates. This invoice is technically 6 months old and even though we have today’s date, they didn’t bother to update the service date with something that made sense. When you’re reviewing these types of emails, pay attention to the dates & times. Also, most invoices don’t just include the name of a person, they typically include other details like address & phone number, customer number and more. Doing that legwork takes to much effort and most scammers are lazy so they apply minimum effort.
- Scammers don’t spell check. Since many of these scammers are overseas and often speak with English as a second language, tenses, conjugation, contractions and wording can be awkward and use non-characteristic sentence structure. For example, the use of the word “query” is both misspelled and a very non-American way of saying “questions” or “inquiries”. “Haven’t order it” is also another giveaway, that’s a very non-standard sentence structure and the tense is incorrect.
- Scammers cannot verify accounts. So calling that phone number above gets you to the “customer service center”. They cannot tell you the name of the company that sent the invoice. They cannot tell you your invoice number. They don’t answer the phone as “Proper Sky”. They cannot tell you your email address. There is literally nothing they can do on their end to verify that you are a customer, have received an invoice or even if you are who you say are. If you have gotten this far down the scam, however, they do now know your phone number and, if you give them a working email address or verify it, an obvious “phish” you’re on the hot list for more of these messages.
Got it. So now I know what to look for what should I do?
Unfortunately there aren’t many ways to quickly stop this type of fraud. The scammers are using a Gmail account to send email. So we should report that address (which we have done). You can also do that yourself by contacting Google’s email abuse form. There is one thing you will need to collect something called “Email Headers”. MX Toolbox has an incredibly comprehensive guide to collecting them from different services and software. If you follow those instructions you can easily get the Email Headers, that helps google better diagnose this issue at the source.
Unfortunately, the problem with this approach is that even if the account is cancelled, they simply create a new account move the contacts into it and start spamming again from Gmail again. Each time they have to do it though, it slows them down a little bit so every report helps.
The other thing we need to do is report this phone number. 215.486.6159. First we head to Spokeo an do a lookup. There we see that the phone number is hosted with bandwidth.com.
Then, we head over to Bandwidth.com’s Fraudulent Number Reporting Tool and report the phone number as fraud.
Lastly, we report the fraud to the FBI. In addition to some of the simple steps that we take above, we collect as much metadata as we can about the IP addresses involved, the countries, the time of day, similarities of nearby IP addresses, information regarding hosted IP addresses and much, much more. Unfortunately, the cure takes much, much longer than the initial email to get resolved and can be setup and turned up much faster than it takes to shut it down. Anyone that gets phone calls about auto warranties can tell you this stuff is hard to stop.
We certainly did not send you an invoice so do not pay it!
If you have ANY questions about any of this, please give us a call (215.305.8899). We’re not sure to be flattered or upset but in the meantime, there is a real risk and we want to keep everyone safe.. If this was helpful, let us know. Send us a Tweet, comment on Facebook or peg us on LinkedIn.
Thanks All! Be Safe.

Last year, we made a concerted effort to accomplish two things, build a better toolset to communicate with our customers and develop our website to be a destination for both clients and potential clients.
What we've released today we're incredibly proud of and represents roughly months of hard work from both ourselves, and our partners. Thanks everyone for your help this last year.
Our Plan
The primary hang up to us redoing our site (and doing so for years) was the creation of content. Writing web pages, in our humble opinion, is a difficult job. There are a million different things that the web can do and getting that distilled down to what your customers want to see and what your site needs to do requires serious decision making and/or help. We opted for help and engaged Joe Taylor, Jr. and the wonderful staff of 2820 Press. We developed a comprehensive communications strategy and, over the course of nearly 6 months, wrote all of the copy for the site and about 900 other little things. Their help was instrumental in driving our success.
Our Logo
Our current logo was the primary impetus for change. In our 12 year history, we’ve had one significant logo revision and a minor refresh of that logo about 3 to 4 years ago. In our original logo the idea was to invert the P and the S to look like a mountain, with the central concept of strength, we made it more contemporary but left it the same. For us, a mountain had a lot of symbolism and meshed well with the “Sky” brand. In those intervening 12 years, however, we felt that the world of technology and rock symbols weren’t really an accurate reflection of our core values or, more importantly, of the world of technology as we experienced.
In the intervening years between the release of Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2016, the world of client server computing has experienced a veritable maelstrom of change. Servers are fading away, in office PBX’s have moved to the cloud, Software-As-A-Service has risen to dominance while both the quantity and reliability of devices have exploded. To us, we felt that we needed a logo that better represented the core value of strength but did so in the face of turbulence. Our new logo is our evocation of this emotion. 3 different colored gliders, strong and flexible, using the wind of technological change to propel our clients and ourselves forward. The future is in one direction but will require flexibility and agility to balance the oncoming change.
For this, we opted to use a design competition with 99designs. We found a great designer and spent a lot of time working together and were very happy with the results. We’ll be telling you more about the process later.
The Site
Logo and brand in hand and copy being written, we opted to perform a do-it-ourselves model. WordPress was chosen as our backend for a few reasons; It’s “free”, you don’t need to have a design degree to make additions to it, and there are hundreds of high quality add-ons and plugins that do some amazing things. In our case, the forms on our website integrate with Connectwise, our CRM, and Slack our team communication tool. Additionally, we bought a turnkey “theme” for our wordpress site from Envato thinking it would be super easy to take a few photos, update the color scheme and have a perfect site. Nothing could be further from the truth. Without monumental efforts at first by 2820 Press and later through Edgimo (one of our best and oldest customers) were we able to actually get the site built. Thanks Ben & Peter!
Other Help
As part of this process we engaged a few other incredibly helpful folks, our customers, the ones that let us take photos on their properties (Thanks Interact, Norhthern & 365 Main!). The amazing photography of Jenna Stamm which was an amazing value. The pithy, British copy writing of Thom James Carter and all the staff of Proper Sky, without whom this change would not have been possible. A heart felt thanks to you all.

[7 min read]
Now more than ever, businesses continually observe the ramifications of inadequate cybersecurity awareness training unfold before them. According to some of the nation’s most prominent cybersecurity firms, businesses are being increasingly targeted by hackers, with over 43% of businesses suffering from cybercriminal attacks, up from 37% the year prior.
These attacks are no small nuisance, either. Some sources determined that businesses are spending an average of $2.6 million per year defending themselves, up from around $2.2 million in 2020.
The statistics don’t end there, however. Surveys denote that over 95% of security breaches directly result from human error.
As technology continues its trajectory to become integral for every business to succeed, cybercrime will remain a rampant problem. While we cannot solve cybercrime’s threat to our businesses, we can educate and train ourselves to minimize human error and therefore greatly reduce our risk of a cyber attack.
Security education training and awareness, or security awareness training covers topics such as secure software design, password management, access privileges, secure network connections, social engineering and phishing, device security, threat response, data classification, physical and third-party application security, and much more.
Together, the core aspects of cybersecurity awareness training build a foundation for all employees, leaders, and users to identify and eliminate points of potential failure. Experts cannot stress the importance of security awareness training and its benefits enough.
Security awareness training and education integrate themselves into a business’ two main domains of cybersecurity, their frontline and last lines of defense. Here’s a deeper look into which aspects of security awareness training cover the various facets of cybersecurity, and which domain they fall under:
Types of security endeavors that create frontline defenses
Cybersecurity and ransomware
Building secure software is only half the battle. Malicious software that encrypts data on machines until a user pays an attacker a sum of money to claim the data back, or ransomware, is a plague in our current environment.
As one of the most popular forms of cybercrime, it is paramount that employees and business decision-makers demonstrate online competencies that actively prevent ransomware attacks. Maintaining backups, having an incident response plan, and consistently using updated antivirus applications are just a few precautionary measures.
The most common form of ransomware trap is a phishing email or infected download link. This is where the human aspect of cybersecurity becomes so critical. Some businesses are even issuing “Cybersecurity for Dummies” books to their employees to help crack down on laissez-faire online behavior.
Physical security
When people think of cybersecurity, many envision thousands of lines of code, firewalls, antivirus programs, and email filters. However, hardware security is a cornerstone of upholding high cybersecurity standards.
Some institutions, especially government organizations, issue custom hardware that serves as a hardware key, allowing holders to access certain information, use specific machines, and enter permitted areas. These can be ID cards, USBs with secure software, or NFC tags.
If someone gets their hands on an employee’s badge, card, or key, a malicious user can impersonate an employee, clone the hardware key’s information, and even reverse engineer an organization’s security system.
Decision-makers, influential employees, and others who have access to sensitive information must be wary of leaving devices unattended, passwords written down, or not using two-factor authentication. Merely leaving a laptop in a public area for 45 seconds may be all it takes to compromise one’s physical and online security.
While companies will likely not ask every single one of their employees to adopt and learn high-level cybersecurity skills or comprehend and analyze cybersecurity analytics, it is important to have at least a fundamental understanding of why security awareness training is important and how a single employee’s actions can spiral into massive dangers for them and their company.
Security endeavors that are the last line of defense
Incident response
Cybersecurity consultants, analysts, and professionals constantly preach that risk management is one of the first and foremost priorities in fostering robust online security inside an organization. Though being aware of security breaches is important, how teams react and rectify complications is just as critical.
Simple incident response plans disaster recovery plans, and business continuity strategies are effective ways for IT teams to isolate and solve incidents, preventing them from spiraling out of control. Read about the differences and advantages of BCPs, DRPs, and IRPs.
In some circumstances, simply knowing how to measure anything cybersecurity risk-related can be what separates a nuisance from a zero-day exploit.
Passwords
Over 95% of security breaches occur from human error, with 61% of those incidents attributed to compromised credentials. Password security, though it may seem trivial, is often both the first and last line of defense for many businesses.
Most of the time, password breaches are not caused by hackers guessing them, but through people absent-mindedly entering them and reusing the same phrases in multiple places.
Implementing randomized, encrypted, multi-factor authenticated, and unique passwords are great ways to help minimize the impact that password scammers have on businesses, but ultimately, there is only so much businesses can do to encourage employees to practice responsible cyber behavior.
Mobile security
When traveling, it is very tempting to connect to any and all free Wi-Fi locations, use public phone chargers, and keep sensitive information like credit cards and hardware keys in pockets. Today, cybercriminals can seamlessly clone and steal information wirelessly and undetected.
To truly have competent cybersecurity potential, businesses must find a mesh between frontline and backline defenses to protect their data, both on and offline.

https://propersky.com/services/cloud-services/,"What’s better than blue sky thinking? Cloud thinking.
Without a doubt, the future of tech revolves around cloud-based software — and there’s never been a better opportunity to take advantage of it than right now. We’re finally seeing the long-term advantages of huge enterprise cloud solutions trickling down to the small-to-mid-market companies.
While benefits of the cloud are ultimately dependent on your business, team size, and your mission, leveraging cloud services yields several benefits that are too good to ignore:
Email hosting via the cloud
If you’re still hosting your own email server, we should talk. With Google Suite and Office 365, you’ll have access to secure tools that are always on and always available at a fraction of the cost of self-hosting.
Say goodbye to traditional telco circuits
Does your organization have a complicated setup of MPLS networks, hybrid VPN deployments or expensive, antiquated telco circuits? With cloud services, we can help you cut costs and streamline your setup.
Hosted desktop and server solutions
Cloud workspaces deliver the right data, at the right time, to the right people. Working from the cloud puts you at the digital helm of your organization, with complete control over access, rights, privileges, and more.
No data loss. Ever.
Hosting via the cloud means there’s a secure, real-time backup of your data all the time. It’s an end-to-end encrypted, 100% available enterprise solution accessible at a fraction of the cost when compared to competing models.
The way you work, at scale
Getting traction on just a single tweet could overwhelm your ecommerce system; the cloud presents ways for you to scale your business — in real time — when you need it, and back down when you don’t, so your system remains stable through traffic bursts.
We take a holistic approach to understanding your technology systems, ensuring you have the access and understanding you need in order to benefit from cloud services. We’ll build a cost-effective, tailored solution designed to improve reliability, drive down costs, and provide the necessary security for your organization — all while enabling you with the freedom to access it anywhere, any time.

https://propersky.com/services/cybersecurity/,"In today’s always-on environment, a holistic approach to cybersecurity is far more effective than simply building digital walls. In this new, cloud-connected world, every enterprise needs to balance their business objectives with informational risk.
By taking a simple approach that works with your enterprise’s needs, we review:
External Threat Vectors
Today, the internet is a dangerous place, with hackers developing more sophisticated methods. As consumers add devices to our networks, they exponentially increase security risks. We provide solutions that keep you safer.
Rapid Technology Advances
The times, they are a-changing... How do you decide when legacy technology is holding your organization back? We'll help you make that decision — and manage changes for you.

https://propersky.com/services/ehr-emr/,"From inception to go-live, Proper Sky has your EMR covered – you focus on patients
If your organization is evaluating an EMR or an EHR, you’re likely making the largest and most complicated technology commitment your organization will face. While EMR and EHR vendors promise everything, the delivery typically leaves much to be desired. Fortunately, fixing complicated, technical, and overwhelming issues is our specialty.
By taking a simple approach that works with your enterprise’s needs, we review:
Helping you understand your technology investment
Before making a purchase, you have to consider several factors to ensure it’s worth your while. Though the questions you’ll ask yourself may seem simple, they quickly pile on. We’ll guide you every step of the way, before and after committing to an EHR.
Documenting essential information and training staff
EHR manuals often lack the practical information your staff needs in order to operate an EHR in a day-to-day environment. We specialize in training our clients’ teams to use a new EHR, so you can be confident your staff is using the technology correctly.
Determine your true data costs
When moving to a new EMR, you hope all of your data will be transferred. Sadly, this isn’t always the case. We can help you get the best amount of workable data possible from your legacy systems to your new systems, saving you time, money, and stress.
Turn data into insight
Analytics are crucial to business decisions, but EMR systems rarely come with the tools you need in order to understand your data. We’ll work with you to bring value to your data and give you the resources you need to make it meaningful.

https://propersky.com/services/it-strategy/,"We believe in creating a tailored IT strategy completely aligned with your organization’s goals
Every business is unique; even in crowded local industries, internal processes for one company can be vastly different than those of another. You wouldn’t have the same sales strategy as your competitor — so why would you have a similar IT strategy?
Building a strategy that leverages your organization’s strengths and minimizes any weaknesses takes time and thorough consideration. We carefully factor those aspects into an IT strategy designed for your business.
Here’s what to expect when co-producing with Proper Sky:
Seek to Understand
Before planning a tailored strategy for your company, we gain a firm understanding of the internal workings of your organization. We develop strategies by identifying what makes your company unique, understanding how it functions, and clarifying your goals.
Meticulous strategic planning
We consider your company’s distinct functions, like team size and budget, so our recommendations don’t just work — but work for you. We lay comprehensive groundwork, ensuring your strategy maximizes your success..
Precision Execution
With a plan in place, it’s time to execute. We’ll work with you to implement your unique strategy, taking extra care to ensure it delivers the best results.
Measuring success in a practical way
Our partnership doesn’t end with implementation. We constantly measure our work’s impact, using data to determine the strategy’s success and identifying how we can improve it along the way.
All too often we see organizations view IT as a cost driver and not as an opportunity to increase their bottom line. Let us help you navigate the turbulent world of technology with a plan that fits around YOUR strategic objectives. You need a team with a demonstrated history of strategic success. You need Proper Sky.

https://propersky.com/services/penetration-testing/,"PROTECT YOUR DATA, PROTECT YOUR PEOPLE, PROTECT YOUR COMPANY.
Many companies believe if they have a firewall, anti-virus, and anti-malware configured, their IT network is secure. Unfortunately, this is not the case and these companies often remain seriously exposed to hackers.
Security breaches can result in costly information leakage and may have lasting consequences for businesses. Confidential information, such as credit card data, financial figures and customer records could be extracted with one simple command if malicious users penetrate your systems. This can be prevented by conducting security audits and penetration testing.
Proper Sky provides Penetration Testing Services for newly installed applications or systems, and for existing systems looking to strengthen security measures. We also do pen tests for the following areas:
A Proper Sky penetration test will produce a list of vulnerabilities and remediation steps to help you prioritize improvements to the way you process and store your data, reducing your organizational risk.
From a commercial perspective, a penetration test can help close new business opportunities. If your customers operate in a highly regulated industry, they may need you to provide documentation of your environment regularly conducting security tests. The ability to demonstrate this as part of your negotiations may be critical to you landing the deal.
All of our application testing methodologies align to the OWASP top 10 standard, which is the industry standard for application security.

[6 min read]
In early April of 2022, the Department of Justice (DoJ) publicly disclosed that they secretly removed various malware and malicious software from thousands of computer networks worldwide. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland announced that this court-authorized operation took place throughout March 2022 in an effort to preemptively counteract Russian cyberattacks and make a statement toward the Russian Federation’s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU).
The malware in question
The operation duplicated and removed malware from vulnerable internet-connected firewall devices that Sandworm, a Russian cyber-military unit of the GRU, uses for command and control (C2) of botnets. Although the DoJ’s actions did not involve accessing Sandworm’s malware inside the victim’s devices, the Department of Justice disabled command and control mechanisms that provide Sandworm control of the victims’ devices, referred to as “bots.”
The United States suspects that Russia may attack American corporate infrastructure in response to heavy sanctions the U.S. imposed on Moscow as a result of the war in Ukraine.
It remains unclear what the malware’s purpose was, but experts say the botnet could’ve been sued for everything from conventional surveillance to city-wide cyberattacks. Officials involved in the strike state that the United States, in tandem with several other governments around the world didn’t want to wait around to find out how the malware could be used against them.
Hackers create a botnet primarily through phishing scams and implanting malware into users’ computers that lie dormant until attackers wish to use them. Bot attack prevention is slightly different than other forms of malware protection.
Malicious groups of computers can be difficult to detect, and as for users, there is no concrete way to tell if your computer is part of a botnet without actively using updated antivirus software.
The politics surrounding the initiative
The court order equipped the F.B.I with the power to dive into national corporate networks to remove malware, with or without the company’s knowledge. Special Agent Mike Nordwall of the F.B.I stated, “The FBI prides itself on working closely with our law enforcement and private sector partners to expose criminals who hide behind their computers and launch attacks that threaten Americans’ safety, security, and confidence in our digitally connected world.”
Attorney General Olsen stated that the botnet removal “demonstrates the department’s commitment to disrupt nation-state hacking using all of the legal tools at their disposal.”
Investigators suspect that the Russian hackers attempt to persistently access and control international energy sector computer networks. These claims are backed by several phases of historical Russian hacks, such as when the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) successfully installed malware on over 17,000 devices around the world, primarily those owned by power and energy companies.
Another phase involved calculated spearphishing attacks against over 300 high-profile individuals across more than 500 companies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and others around the world.
The importance of the court orders
While many view the Department of Justice’s initiative as an act of preliminary defense, others view it as another breach of privacy, security, and even an act of hypocrisy.
While internet and network attacks are nothing new for the United States, some question the government’s position to hack into corporate systems to prevent attacks, such as botnet or ransomware scams. Several cybersecurity professionals and prominent consumers have pointed out that companies and individuals should be responsible for upholding their own virtual security, and the government is not above the Russian hackers for accessing companies’ data without permission first.
Other industry experts cede that the government acted upon a call of not only the companies’ security but the potential for the hackers to cause mass harm across the nation and other countries. Given the political climate and Sandworm’s history, many cybersecurity analysts and investigators think that the court orders were justified and serve as a reminder to potentially unaware or ill-prepared entities that they are never safe in cyberspace.
The significance of the court orders are a global reminder of where the moral and legal lines lie in cyberspace. As the world grows increasingly reliant on virtual integrity, and some governments struggle to keep up with the information technology revolution, these conversations are critical to strengthening our online defenses moving forward. Where do you stand?

Do I need to worry about VPNFilter?
We’ve had a few conversations with customers this week about the new VPNFilter virus from Russia, what it is and if they need to worry. The FBI has reiterated their guidance that users should reboot their routers. If you’re a customer of ours, have no fear, this attack has been limited to what we’d call “residential grade” routers, routers really designed for home use and security. We would never put one of these in your office. Often these devices are the first things we get rid of for our smaller business customers.
For home users though, look out. Even if your router isn’t on the list below, we think rebooting your router is a good idea (turn it off and on again). Your internet will down for a minute or two, and you may minimize the risk if routers they didn’t expect are infected. Below you find the complete list of routers that have been affected by the VPNFilter hack and a link to where you can download a “clean” version of the firmware. If you have one of these routers DO THIS IMMEDIATELY or call us, we can help.
- Linksys E1200
- Linksys E2500
- Linksys WRVS4400N
- Mikrotik RouterOS for Cloud Core Routers: Versions 1016, 1036, and 1072
- Netgear DGN2200
- Netgear R6400
- Netgear R7000
- Netgear R8000
- Netgear WNR1000
- Netgear WNR2000
- QNAP TS251
- QNAP TS439 Pro
- Other QNAP NAS devices running QTS software
- TP-Link R600VPN
For those of you with the following models of routers, you DEFINITELY need to reboot and set your routers back to factory default. It could be a bit tricky so if you’re stuck, give us a call and one of our amazing folks can help. We think a lot more routers will be discovered than this, but as of now, this is what have been discovered in the wild. There are currently 500K devices affected right now says the FBI.
Interested in how this works? Read On…
Talos Security, a respected IT Security firm, details, how this works. Basically, you connect to a photo server, download some information and addresses hidden in the photo and some instructions and then it downloads a “payload”. The payload starts checking in with a command and control server which in turn decides what it wants to run on your router. This could be anything, a password sniffer, a malware injector, a DDOS agent, it’s really up to the attacker and what they want to do. What is clear though is that they pretty much own ALL the traffic coming in and out of your router and can do what they like.
Since the hack is exposed now the router manufacturers will be working on fixes for this. Also the FBI has taken control of the command and control server and seized the domain which means the servers that were issuing commands are most likely out of commission (for now anyway), once the hack gets shared, expect a bunch of copy cats to use the same exploit. In our opinion, it’s best to get rid of this router for now and find something else. We can make some recommendations if you’re interested.

Or, it’s the end of the world as we know it…
As you have no doubt heard, on Friday, the NHS in Britain was effectively shut down because of a new crypto virus. A security researcher accidentally shut it down, but the spread of this virus was so widespread that for the first time in recent memory, Microsoft issued patches for Windows XP and Server 2003 including during the weekend. Even though the virus is stopped, the success of this virus will enable copycats. For a complete breakdown of the risk, I recommend this article.
The virus comes in the form of an email that requires you to enter a password. Once you enter that password, you open the file and it immediately begins copying itself to all the computers on the network and encrypting your files. You have just hosed your network.
We’ve been hard at work on this all weekend.
- We wrote and executed a script that disables the main reason for this exploit an old technology called SMB v1.0. Some scanners and copy machines sadly still use this.
- We’ve installed and continue to install patches as they arrive and are ensuring that antivirus protection is up to date. We’re getting the PC’s that were turned off this weekend and the new patch for servers done.
- Local Backups are good but offsite backups are better. This malware will also encrypt backup files. We’ve been verifying offsite backups as well.
- We’re spreading the word. Don’t open emails that require a password UNLESS you talk to the person on the phone or by text that the message is legitimate.
While the vast majority of our customers have us manage their networks, some do not. We’ll be sending out some tips home users and others can use to make sure they’re safe from this virus attack.

https://propersky.com/what-are-managed-it-services/,"What are Managed IT Services?
[8 min read]
No matter the industry, businesses need IT to ensure everything runs smoothly. Computers, phone lines, databases and internet, passwords, and even technical support are foundational aspects of countless small-medium businesses (SMBs) and large corporations alike.
Issues arise when businesses have technical needs that out-match their in-house talent. On top of talent, it can be challenging for SMBs to keep updated on the latest technology business trends, especially in an ever-changing market.
For many small businesses, juggling everyday responsibilities and IT services is unmanageable. This is where managed IT services for small businesses can help.
What are managed IT services and Managed Service Providers?
A managed service is any task or set of tasks assigned to a third party. In the case of managed IT services, assigning IT duties to available professionals is a great way to ensure businesses get expert assistance, reduce costs and increase profit, lessen workloads on team members, and increase service quality.
MSPs can specialize in equipment monitoring and controlling, systems management, remote assistance, task flow management, local and remote server management, networking maintenance, and much more.
Traditionally, MSPs monitor systems within a business until they break, need service, or a client wants to update something. However, modern MSPs opt to take upon more active roles within their clients’ businesses.
MSPs may install patches to products, implement predictive algorithms to identify critical areas in need of maintenance, and even contribute to IT project management plans. The services MSPs advertise depend on companies looking for IT support in current markets.
What’s the difference between managed services and outsourcing?
As a first impression, ‘managed IT services’ might sound very similar to outsourcing. However, there are several differences.
Firstly, managed services are more specific than outsourced work. When organizations outsource IT services, for example, all necessary resources and needs are handed off to the contracting company.
MSPs integrate with a company instead of acting independently. Pair this with longer contractual propositions and increased transparency; there are many reasons why managed services are highly regarded, unlike outsourcing.
Another important contrast between outsourcing and its evolved counterpart is managed services allow businesses to ensure that the proper tools, techniques, and talent are applied to their problems. Outsourcing can be a coin-flip, especially with budget outsourcing firms.
Last but not least, working with managed service providers allow businesses to form stronger vendor-vendee relationships.
One of the main appeals of MSPs versus outsourcing firms is the greater emphasis on involvement and relationships
Why managed IT services?
The benefits of utilizing managed IT services are bountiful, especially for startups and small-medium businesses. Here are just a few:
MSPs can fill skill gaps and provide the right talent in the right place
In small and medium businesses, it’s common for the core team members only to be experienced in a few fields. Not everyone has a background in IT, networking, cybersecurity, or software development.
Allowing managed IT, service providers to supply businesses with the technology, knowledge, and expertise they need is often the secret to increasing a team’s productivity and reducing the stress of running a business off critical team members.
In small businesses and startups, the importance of hiring the right talent cannot be undervalued. Every dollar invested, hour worked, and team member hired plays a critical role in a company’s success.
Using Managed IT services can save organizations money
Entrepreneurs know how expensive managing and maintaining new, innovative IT services can be. It can feel like the expenses are endless, from hiring and paying the appropriate workers to pay for IT technologies themselves.
MSPs can take much of that financial load off of clients. When transitioning to MSPs, they can make expenses more predictable, reduce operating costs, and leaders can redirect more attention to other aspects of the business.
MSPs also bring increased reliability and robustness to IT services
When resources are few and far apart, having a website or server crash is a nightmare. Businesses also need to ensure efficient, clear communication with their staff to validate every aspect of their IT services is accounted for and functioning.
Keeping servers running, websites up-to-date, and employee machines managed are just a few of the responsibilities of an MSP. These terms are laid out in service level agreements (SLAs) to clarify expectations.
While an SMB team juggles responsibilities, MSPs are committed to taking IT services off countless plates. Preventing and managing crisis situations are an MSP’s bread and butter.
Working with MSPs can greatly reduce the workload on small business teams, allowing them to redirect their efforts
What kinds of managed IT services are available?
There are countless managed IT services and thousands of MSPs providing them. These IT services range from extremely specific to unreasonably broad.
If SMBs want anything from a helpdesk support technician to a highly-specialized bottleneck analysis team, MSPs can provide it. However, there are a few favorites amongst today’s businesses.
Equipment maintenance, in-house or external systems management, networking monitoring and maintenance, software development, machine learning, and artificial intelligence deployments are just a handful.
Cloud-based services like Software as a Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) help businesses scale operations to meet increased demand and are a trendy managed set of services.
Cloud computing, cloud-based servers, AI, and machine learning are just a few of today’s IT services on demand. Imagine what the future of managed services will look like.
How much should managed IT services cost?
Managed service providers most commonly provide services in the form of subscription packages, with each tier offering customers more available resources, increased automation, or more thorough maintenance tactics. How a business decides to pay and implement IT services will impact what they seek in an MSP and what IT services they want to manage.
What happens if a business outgrows its MSP?
Once services become too vital to business operations, SMBs scale up or a business becomes increasingly profitable, they may manage IT services in-house. Increased horizontal integration, reducing points of failure, added accountability, and complete control of IT deployments are some reasons businesses may want to switch.
The benefits of managed IT services are limitless when deployed correctly. However, it is wise for businesses to analyze the opportunity cost of working with an MSP, realize their needs, and conduct market research to identify if an MSP is right for them.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]

[8 min read]
In our first post, we talked about what exactly are Managed IT Services. If you’d heard MSPs before but had no idea what they are, we recommend you start with that article.
But now that you know what managed it services really are, how do you know if they are right for your company?
Well, you’ve come to the right place. This article is all about the benefits of managed it services for your small and medium business.
One of the most ubiquitous and challenging problems in business is executing a vision while applying the right people and resources to the appropriate tasks. Managing daily duties in-house can prove too difficult, especially in small and medium businesses (SMBs).
Keeping up with all the latest trends in the various areas of technology, networking, IT services, big data, and machine learning can overwhelm SMBs. A colossal budget is often an encumbrance for those who need access to the cutting edge of technology to remain competitive.
Managed service providers (MSPs) have excellent managed tech solutions from resource management to talent on demand. Hundreds of small and medium businesses, corporations, and enterprises save hundreds of thousands of dollars per year utilizing managed IT services.
The value of the managed service industry is expected to skyrocket to over $350 billion by 2050. Why are managed IT services so effective?
Predictable and scaleable spending
IT services, especially the trending and popular innovations, can be extremely costly. For small and medium businesses, investing in IT upfront can be nearly impossible. Managing costs and savings are a small business’ bread and butter.
With IT services, operating expenses are consolidated into a single subscription, plan, or regular rate from MSPs. The cost savings and predictable usage of funds allow businesses to allocate remaining financial resources to other endeavors.
Once a business’ demand exceeds its capability, it can simply increase its IT service requirements from the MSP. Because managed service providers commonly work with SMBs and multimillion-dollar corporations, scalability is linear and manageable. Companies large and small all save time and money with MSPs.
Allows core team members to focus their attention elsewhere
Everyone from hiring managers, subject matter experts, and founding members can benefit from managed services in one way or another. Managed services allow employees to focus on other services they want to retain in-house while ‘outsourcing’ other services that potentially demand more talent, more resources, or higher computational requirements. MSPs give businesses the breathing room they need to find new ways of increasing business efficiency and growth.
High-quality MSPs will allow clients to dynamically adjust their IT needs based on the company’s size, revenue, budget, and demand. This way, businesses can decide whether they want an MSP to keep their servers online or envelop the entire IT department.
Easy access to professional talent
Innovative and cutting-edge technology also brings about new problems and challenges. Sometimes, an organization’s existing IT team doesn’t have the resources or knowledge to tackle these challenges. While businesses can overcome the challenges with new technology through hiring new talent, there are considerable expenses and indirect effects of recruiting new team members.
Companies no longer have to carry the weight of training people. MSPs provide organizations with the talent, resources, and training organizations and individuals need to succeed.
SMBs also have the peace of mind that there is always the right talent at the wheel, no matter what managed services they are using.
More reliable IT services
When businesses have to incorporate extensive and continuous IT services into their day-to-day operations, sometimes quality control issues slip through the cracks. Servers can shut down, websites overload, and even the staff’s internet can malfunction.
Utilizing an MSP for IT services allows SMBs to access highly reliable, robust, and efficient IT administrators, support teams, troubleshooters, and engineers.
When implemented correctly, MSPs can be the key to seamless, effective, and hardened IT service 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Customers value high response times, minimal compliance issues, dependable products, and MSPs can deliver.
Better cyber security
Security is undoubtedly a topic of interest when dedicating IT services to a third party. However, many MSPs have certifications and licenses that ensure the data they handle is encrypted, secure, or resides behind layers of online countermeasures.
Using MSPs can reduce the risk of online bot attacks and credit card scams and prevent users from laundering money. Some of the most basic MSPs offer better standard security than many SMBs. Any added security benefits all parties involved.
MSPs Actively scale with their clients
As we briefly covered before, MSPs allow businesses to dynamically adjust how many managed services they want, what type, and the MSP’s involvement within the company. As technology evolves, demand increases, or the industry slows down; businesses may reduce or increase their ties with an MSP.
For example, a business uses an MSP to support its entire IT department and support team. Over time, the company begins to scale up with increased demand, more customers, and shifting market conditions.
The business can then seek to have an MSP manage additional IT services to keep up with demand. This can include AI and machine learning implementation, better cyber security, higher volume tech support, and more resources dedicated to maintaining and updating the company’s products.
How to choose an MSP right for your business
It can be challenging for SMBs to take advantage of the many benefits of managed services if they don’t even have an MSP! Here are some key characteristics for an ideal MSP:
- Offer adaptable and adjustable service plans. SMBs must ensure the managed service offerings suit their needs
- Maintain strong relationships with several cloud providers and fellow IT solution providers
- Offer both basic and advanced services
- Provide 24/7 support for both its clients and its clients’ customers
- Capitalize on remote monitoring and maintenance
- Has a robust legal team
- Has licenses or certifications in cyber security practices
- Provide value-based services in addition to IT management services
- Maintain continual updates to both their technology and their techniques
offer various types of managed IT services that scale with a business’s growth
- Has a pre-existing list of established customers
- Offers managed services for enterprises as well as small businesses

[6 min read]
What is the CVSS?
The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a scoring scale upheld by the CVSS Special Interest Group to rank vulnerabilities by severity. The criteria that give a vulnerability its CVSS score are grouped under two umbrella categories.
Exploitability metrics gauge how easy it is to exploit a vulnerability, and impact metrics determine the extent of what is lost in the event of an attack, defined by the CIA triad, confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
In the latest version, CVSS version 3.1, here are the vulnerability management metrics and their groups:
Exploitability metrics
- Attack Vector
- Attack Complexity
- Privileges Required
- User Interaction
Impact metrics
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability
- Scope
What does a CVSS score of 10 mean?
To make communicating the severity of vulnerabilities to less-technical people more straightforward, the CVSS groups the scored vulnerabilities into different brackets.
CVSS Score Qualitative Ratings:
0.0 – No severity
0.1 – 3.9 – Low severity
4.0 – 6.9 – Medium severity
7.0 – 8.9 – High severity
9.0 – 10.0 – Critical Severity
Several other factors impact a CVSS severity score, such as the vulnerability’s exploit code maturity, remediation level, and report confidence. Typically, the highest possible score of a critical and destructive vulnerability is 9.8.
Overall, around 14% of vulnerabilities have CVSS 9.8. Only a minute fraction of those rank CVSS 10.0. Vulnerabilities with a score of 9.8 have high impact scores, exploitability metrics are at maximum severity, and the code is actively dangerous.
The only way for a vulnerability to reach the ultimate critical status is for the scope of the vulnerability to change dynamically, posing the greatest threat to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
CVSS 10.0 vulnerabilities are the most difficult to identify, track, analyze, and reverse engineer for cybersecurity professionals. Imagine trying to solve a complex math question, but every time you moved to your calculator and returned, the problem had changed.
Once organizations identify operationally critical threats, they can conduct vulnerability evaluations to patch the issue. While there are dozens of types of vulnerabilities in network security, most of them have a vulnerability severity level of 1.0 to 5.0.
What was Log4J?
The Log4J vulnerability set the internet on fire. Throughout 2021 we saw handfuls of head-turning cyber attacks and vulnerabilities. Log4J was arguably the largest and most impactful one of the year.
While cybercriminals rushed to exploit this vulnerability, they kept dozens of cybersecurity professionals and developers hustling, trying to identify how many products and users were affected, how to stop it, and how to patch the vulnerability.
How did Log4J start?
Minecraft, one of the largest video games on the market, lies at the beginning of Log4J’s history. The game amasses over 141 million players per year, and some of them discovered they could run code on servers and other players’ computers.
While Minecraft’s developers quickly patched the issue, the game is built on Java, and Java is almost everywhere. Soon, the vulnerability appeared on other products and services; Amazon, Apple’s iCloud, Cisco, Tesla, and Twitter were all now exposed to this new vulnerability.
Log4J allowed malicious users to send code to Log4J. It would store the code and leave a virtual door open for hackers to take over servers and information. Cybersecurity professionals note this process as one of Java’s design flaws.
Pairs the flaw with companies heavily relying on Log4J and performing uncomprehensive vulnerability analyses, Log4J provides cybercriminals the perfect opportunity to wreak havoc.
Why is Log4J is such a big deal?
With barely a few keystrokes, cybercriminals could waltz into some of the world’s largest company’s servers, completely bypassing password, two-factor authentication, and in-server security. Once penetrated, hackers could do anything they’d like.
Installing ransomware, selling data on the black market, embedding malware hidden in plain sight, harvesting user information, and even targetting individuals working at these companies were all potentially dire outcomes of a single vulnerability.
Netlab quotes at least ten different families of malware circulating for this vulnerability, and everything from bots to cyber attackers want a piece of it. For the technical giants, such as Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Tesla, patching the Log4J vulnerability was relatively straightforward.
However, countless third-party service providers heavily rely on Log4J, and businesses who depend on them must hope that they dedicate the resources to fix the issue. Some barely have the resources to do so, and until now, some sources say that not everyone has fully recovered.
By now, you’ve likely concluded that the Log4J vulnerability scored CVSS 10.0 out of 10.0, mostly because of its diversity, danger, and ubiquity. Events such as the Log4J incident showcase how vital vulnerability mitigation is.
For months, organizations, vendors, and even individuals had Log4J’s priority level at the top of every list. While it wasn’t the most significant vulnerability to computer information security in history, it posed tremendous threats to countless users and high-profile companies.

[9 min read]
No one is safe in today’s online environment. No matter how secure you think you browse, how well you erase your digital footprint, there is no number of privacy and online safety settings you can toggle on to hide from the internet’s scope.
Now, as the world ushers deeper into the digital revolution, we grow increasingly reliant on maintaining our digital presence. For many of us, wider digital footprints breed convenience and accessibility. However, we seem to display our entire lives on the web, and not every user is well-intentioned.
With the prevalence of digital information, it can be hard to ensure you are in control of your data and are practicing appropriate online behaviors, ensuring you prevent data breaches and leaks. Cyber-criminals and scammers run rampant in an online world where they twist and manipulate the rules in their favor. As consumers, business owners, and internet users, a few passwords are often the only thing that stands between us and our most valuable information. Here are some ways to ensure that your information stays yours.
Use and update antivirus software
Ransomware, which encrypts and locks your files behind exorbitant paywalls, trojan horses, which emulate real programs but actually mine your device for information, bots, which can seize control of your computers, and hackers, who can make turn your life upside down with just a few keystrokes. Whether we like it or not, innumerable threats are lurking behind deceptive links and within the shadows of pop-up ads.
Fortunately, antivirus software can greatly reduce the number of shady links we click on and viruses we expose ourselves to online. When configured correctly, you can set and forget your antivirus software. It can continually run in the background and silently protect you from harmful malware.
It’s best practice to periodically open the software and run scans, check for updates, and quarantine any security threats the software may find. A good rule of thumb when browsing services, files, and websites online, is that if it seems too good to be true, it is.
Your device may have “internet security,” “VPNs,” or “antivirus software” built into it. However, third-party utilities are almost always better. The tools that come with your device are likely lightweight, underpowered, or simply not as effective as other tools out there.
Some antivirus softwares come with companion apps, browser safeguard extensions, and more. We recommend utilizing software like Malwarebytes, Avast, or Bitdefender to take your online protection up a notch.
Use unique passwords
Many people underestimate how vulnerable they are if hackers compromise one or two of their passwords. You may think, “I have a complicated password, hackers could never guess it.”
Hackers, scammers, and even bots have advanced tools and algorithms that can run through millions of password combinations in just hours. On top of brute-force cracking passwords, most scammers steal passwords much more methodically.
Some cybercriminals will pose as company support lines and ask you to say your password to verify your identity. Some scammers use fake websites or clone popular banking, travel, and email websites to prompt you to enter your password, which they cross-reference with accounts you have anywhere on the entire internet. If you reuse a password even once, hackers have the opportunity to scale their information scandal up until your entire life is in their hands.
Use unique passwords that are combinations of sentences, special characters, dates, and special identifiers to help you know which password to input. This simple practice increases your security tenfold. This is how to protect sensitive information.
Sometimes keeping track of dozens of passwords can be disorienting, so we recommend using premium password trackers that do not sell user information, conduct password compromisation tests, and suites of other security features. Managers like Dashlane, BitWarden, and LastPass are highly rated and loved in the cybersecurity community.
Consider using VPNs
Think of how much privacy you think you have online browsing the internet. You can hide behind Tor, incognito windows, DuckDuckGo, and cleared caches, but users have a complete lack of privacy.
If you think you are fooling anyone with your searching information without using a virtual private network (VPN), think again. When connecting to Wi-Fi, especially public networks, do you ever take the time to validate how secure it is?
Someone else may be observing exactly what you’re doing on your computer in real-time right next to you. VPNs encrypt your internet traffic by routing your connections through servers owned by your VPN service provider. This technology makes your internet activity completely anonymous and encrypted.
Use Multi-Factor Authentication
Multi-factor authentication, also known as two-factor authentication (MFA/2FA) is one of the best modern security measures. It can sometimes be a nuisance to have several devices with you, but it doubles your password security if you decide to reuse some passwords.
Currently, some solutions are more elegant than others, such as Apple devices in the Apple Ecosystem seamlessly completing 2FA automatically if you’re wearing an Apple Watch, holding your iPhone, near your Macbook, or have your iPad.
Other solutions include authentication apps, one-time passwords (OTPs) sent through texts, phone call verifications, hardware keys, and more. Nearly every major online service will present the option for MFA, and you should take it.
Use private social media accounts
There are dozens of debates about the best way to protect yourself when using social media. However, posting anything online always hosts a degree of risk, and the best way to restrict how well big data companies know you are is to not use social media or to not post anything you wouldn’t want your boss, parents, and your older self to see.
Using private social media accounts wards off stalkers, ill-intentioned users, and disabling trackers and privacy settings go a long way to reduce the amount of data that hackers can access.
Beware of phishing emails
Many internet users may think they can easily recognize and ignore phishing emails and fraud when in reality, phishing scams are growing increasingly believable, and people are more vulnerable than they think. In 2020, The Internet Crime Complaint Center found that over 240,000 people fell victim to harmful phishing scams.
Continually keep yourself up-to-date on recent phishing scams, patterns, and diction to catch scammers in the act. Even clicking on pop-up ads in the wrong place can compromise your device, and scammers can hack into your friends’ and family’s social media accounts, send you links, and gain complete control over your device.
Learning techniques to validate that links indeed direct you where they should, such as hovering over them and checking the status bar that appears on the bottom left of most browsers is a great way to start.
These tips barely scratch the surface of what you can do to secure yourself online because there are countless ways you can damage yourself on the internet. However, with these major bases covered, you will be two, three, or even four times as secure as you are now.

[7 min read]
No matter how advanced, profitable, or talented organizations are, no business is immune to risks and business interruptions. In the cybersecurity industry, organizations need robust and tested strategies to survive in the current environment where threats, cyberattacks, and zero-days are more common and sophisticated than ever.
Organizations must have comprehensive incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans to ensure their company stays afloat. These plans decrease operational downtime, help preclude financial losses, and allow organizations to adapt and dynamically respond to threats.
Moreover, an organization’s crisis identification, mitigation, and recuperation proficiency indicate its integrity and understanding of the industry. Response plans serve to prepare and protect organizations from potential information and cybersecurity incidents like data breaches, zero-day exploits, and even negligence.
While we focus on the cybersecurity, IT, and networking aspects of response and recovery plans, they are adaptable for any purpose, goal, or incident an organization may face.
What is an Incident Response Plan?
Incident response plans (IRPs) are an organization’s procedures, practices, and staff responsibilities should cyber-attacks, mass-phishing frauds or zero-day exploits bombard the company. IRPs help businesses break down and denote:
- Step-by-step actions the company should take when facing attacks or incidents
- Each responding team member’s roles and responsibilities
- Concise communication plans
- Key performance indicators and metrics for measuring the efficacy of the company’s incident response
Incident response plans work best when paired with business analytics. Analysts can help leaders pinpoint how incidents affect business operations, how that translates to an impact on the organization, and which resources the company needs to minimize operational downtime.
These factors create an incident response life cycle, allowing leaders to observe and execute the plan in phases, depending on the incident and how the company responds. For example, a ransomware incident response varies from its server blackout IRP, both planning and execution.
What is a Disaster Recovery Plan?
A disaster recovery plan or DRP is a detailed, organized approach to reallocate resources to rectify an incident efficiently. Network backups are a prime example of disaster recovery plans in action.
IT disaster recovery plans typically revolve around cybersecurity, data centers, network upkeep, and software deployment. They are usually organized by what the recovery plan would cover, like the type of disaster.
As for what elements a disaster recovery plan should cover, six main pieces compose viable DRPs. These categories change across organizations and industries, but they all are similar in purpose and execution.
- Identify the scope of the recovery plan
- Create a disaster recovery team with roles and responsibilities
- Identify risks and assess their severity.
- Determine the strategies, critical team members, procedures, and resources needed to recover essential business operations
- Create a communication plan
- Create a schedule for implementing, testing, reviewing, and maintaining the work of the DRP
These disaster recovery plan steps help break down each critical process an organization needs to recover from disaster efficiently. Many organizations may not recognize the value of conducting such an analysis, but once they do, they seldom question why yearly disaster recovery testing is a best practice.
What is a Business Continuity Plan?
Business continuity plans, or BCPs, encompass the primary dimensions of incident response and disaster recovery plans. However, BCPs only contain elements of DRPs and IRPs and are not an umbrella solution for incidents.
BCPs are more dynamic in analyzing the tools, resources, and processes needed to create a packaged approach to prevent and recover from company threats and incidents. Many people think of business continuity plans as the entire process of identifying, responding, mitigating, and recovering from attacks and disasters.
Primary Differences Between BCPs, DRPs, & Incident Response Plans
While the incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans have a lot of overlap, here, we will break down how they are unique and what their specific advantages are:
Incident response plans
Organizations typically use IRPs for cybersecurity risks like data breaches, ransomware, and phishing attacks. IRPs specializes in identifying how to respond and mitigate cybersecurity incidents.
Disaster recovery plans
Indented environmental and large-scale disruptions, like hardware and power outages, natural disasters, extreme weather, and significant cyberattacks, businesses create DRPs to travel throughout an organization, allowing any team member, technical or not, to understand and deploy the recovery plan.
IRPs and DRPs work best when organizations use them in tandem, using both plans to influence the other. In some cases, businesses use the same team for both incident response and recovery.
Business continuity plans
Business continuity plan components help organizations approach incidents holistically, allowing the scope of BCPs to change and alter how companies develop IRPs and DRPs. BCPs are strategies that help organizations ensure they can still facilitate vital business operations through or despite downtime, attacks, or incidents.
Incident response plans and disaster recovery plans are like the process by which a business continuity plan is executed and maintained. In most cases, organizations need all three plans to develop a strategy for maintaining business operations despite disasters, recovering from attacks, and responding to isolated and business-wide incidents.

What Exactly Is IT Cybersecurity?
IT cybersecurity is a protection system for your company’s IT network.
Cybersecurity technology is essential for protecting all of your programs and networks from unexpected digital attacks. This technology blocks important information from being stolen, deleted, or altered. It guards against identity theft.
Cybersecurity gives you and your company financial protection from anyone attempting to extort your money (or your user’s money). It also blocks any interruption in your daily business processes.
Why Cybersecurity Is Important For A Modern Day Society
Why is information security important?
There are many reasons why cybersecurity is critical in today’s society. A company or individual simply can not afford to take the issue lightly.
Here are several reasons why it is important in today’s world to be cyber-safe:
1. Common Crime: Cybercrime is actually a very common crime – far more common than people realize. The odds are in your favor to be attacked.
“According to the FBI, there are 4,000 ransomware attacks targeting businesses daily, and in 2020, there was one ransomware victim every 10 seconds. There were about 26,000 Distributed Denial of Service attacks each day in the same year, which averages out to 18 per minute.” –The University of Tulsa
Globally there are millions of malicious cyber attacks, and the numbers are only growing.
2. Personal Protection: Computer privacy is a huge issue. Sensitive personal information is commonly “stolen” through cyber attacks. Passwords can not protect you or your company from these identity crimes.
Literally, everyone is vulnerable to cybercrime:
- anyone who shops in person or through online retailers
- anyone who enjoys online banking
- anyone who plays games online
- anyone who enjoys entertainment or travel
These services place you and your company (and your users) in a position to be an easy target without proper security measures in place.
Did you know that nearly ⅓ of all American adults have experienced some form of identity theft and network security issues?
And often, more than once. Phishing sites are relentless and it’s important to be as prepared as possible.
Your customers need to be protected through strong IT system security when utilizing your services.
3. Financial Losses: There is a huge economic impact from cyberattacks. Companies and individuals suffer massive financial losses from cybercrime and costly lost time.
Cyber issues could even be the cause of a recession – something discussed a lot these days.
“ Cybercrime will inflict damages totaling more than $6 trillion globally by the end of 2021, up from $3 trillion in 2015. It is more expensive than the damage inflicted by natural disasters worldwide – and more profitable than the global illegal drug trade.” -U of T
Billions of dollars are expected to be spent in 2022 towards world cyber protection.
4. National Security: Cybercrime is a huge threat to our national security. Cyber Attacks, like viruses and data breaches, are a threat to our national home security.
These attacks could interrupt our daily lives. Hostile governments, or even terrorist groups, could pose a huge danger to our overall safety if our government and economic sites are not safe and secure. This is why President Biden has repeatedly deemed cybersecurity as a top national priority.
The Cost Of Cybersecurity
Is cyber insurance worth it? In short, yes.
At this point, everyone realizes that the importance of network security is really priceless. Cybersecurity budgets reflect this.
In fact, most companies spend around 6-14% of their annual budgets on this necessary security. Over 150 billion was sent globally in 2021 for data breach prevention, and this figure of network security costs is rising.
So how can you protect your company and yourself?
There are many types of cyber security solutions. Some technology tools and services include:
- Intranet Security as a corporate network security tool will protect your devices through updated software, like anti-malware software.
- Perimeter Security to provide a barrier to attacks, through tools like firewalls, spam protection, and intruder prevention systems.
- Employee Training helps protect against human errors that cause breaks in security. Employee awareness and set policies help with improving cybersecurity. It is crucial for protecting you and your company.
- Testing Security should be included in your IT support prices. Testing can ensure that your employees and systems are up to snuff. Making sure that employees are utilizing company practices can reduce attacks by almost 20%.
- Cyber Security Support with a qualified IT professional and team will help protect you from all current and future attacks.
Cybersecurity is a worthy investment. IT support pricing and ransomware quotes can vary.
In Closing
Nothing is as important as the safety of yourself, your employees, and your clients and customers.
Cybersecurity is a necessary tool for this safety and the overall success of your company. All companies should have an IT professional design proper security and should budget for IT support costs.
Keeping up to date with the evolution of cyber security is critical for staying safe and secure. This protection is necessary – so shop around for the best managed IT services pricing.

[9 min read]
In the ever-evolving and increasingly popular fields of business and technology, upholding the best cybersecurity practices is paramount to ensure your customers, clients, or users aren’t exposed to the countless threats plaguing the internet. In addition to your customers’ virtual safety, businesses must remain vigilant against malicious hackers, bots, scripts, worms, and hundreds of simple yet devastating online attacks.
Cybersecurity risk assessments can help your businesses expose threats to your organization’s digital wellbeing and prioritize issues that may undermine your user’s privacy. The risk assessments are straightforward, lay the foundation for cybersecurity solutions, and may save your organization hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages in the future.
What is a cybersecurity risk assessment?
Typically, cybersecurity consultants schedule interviews with each of your company’s key members to analyze their policies, procedures, security measures, and daily practices. After compiling and analyzing the results, the consultant tailors a risk assessment to your business’s characteristics, factoring in team size, industry regulations and standards, projects, and technical literacy of your team.
Afterward, your IT staff works closely with the risk assessors to run through scenarios. They forecast vulnerabilities, the consequences they could have on your clients and organization, what practices the team should and shouldn’t be doing, as well as what tools your business can use to bolster its virtual security.
What is the purpose of IT & cybersecurity risk assessment?
Cybersecurity risk assessments help businesses emerge aware and ready to prevent cybersecurity risks. Your business’ IT staff should have the knowledge, resources, and ability to identify and prevent cybersecurity incidents, and having consultants, risk assessments, and periodic cybersecurity checks can save your business and customers.
Unfortunately, not all risk assessments are as simple as a checklist and an instruction manual. Especially in the cybersecurity realm, it can be difficult to quantify risks, and the threat issues pose to your business.
In most cases, cybersecurity consultants will combine their understanding of your business with their background in the modern security environment to help you create a plan of action against your most consequential security threats, IT vulnerabilities, and online practices.
Why do companies conduct cybersecurity risk assessments?
Usually, organizations conduct risk assessments before significant acquisitions, investments, changes with IT staff, when switching or adopting new technology, and periodically to keep up with the frighteningly rapid changes in the technological security space. Additionally, some industries so heavily rely on robust cybersecurity that organizations must conduct risk assessments to comply with laws and standards. Cybersecurity, healthcare, and finance are prime examples.
In most cases, IT management and support companies in the Philadelphia, Denver, and Pennsylvania areas will already incorporate risk management in their network security. Still, you can continually improve your company’s cybersecurity through managed IT services or risk assessments.
Benefits of Conducting a Cybersecurity Risk Assessment
Identify Cybersecurity & IT Vulnerabilities
Unlike speeding on the highway or walking alone in a bad neighborhood, the term “risk” has a different meaning in the cybersecurity world. Risk is the potential losses you face when a threat exploits a vulnerability.
Vulnerabilities like weak passwords introduce risks of unauthorized access and exposing confidential information. Companies can impose greater password requirements blacklist commonly used and easy-to-crack passwords to mitigate the risk of a password vulnerability.
While weak passwords are just one example of a vulnerability, everything from an email worm to a backdoor into your data centers are vulnerabilities that businesses must recognize. Each vulnerability poses a risk.
Whether your clients depend on you to ensure their data is safe or your employees entrust their company to protect their online presence, treat each vulnerability as if it were guaranteed to happen. Identify which mitigation strategies are best for the risk and your organization’s resources. Cybersecurity consultants and risks assessments help you do exactly that.
Professional cybersecurity reports and analyses
Cybersecurity risks can appear complicated, ambiguous, or too difficult to measure for new or small and medium businesses. Experts conduct cybersecurity risk assessments to create reports documenting your organization’s current security stature and relevant risks.
If you decide to conduct annual or regular cybersecurity risk assessments, your IT staff and cybersecurity team can quantitatively track your business’ progress as your team develops your security applications. Additionally, archiving regular risk assessments shows investors and clients that you actively invest in cybersecurity and care about everyone’s safety and information.
Available and tailored expertise
While cybersecurity assessment services provide you with valuable data, they represent a snippet of your company’s virtual security stature. For many businesses to reap the benefits of risk assessments, having involved and regular discussions with dedicated cybersecurity experts add exponentially more value to these assessments.
Cybersecurity risk assessments are results, not solutions. They provide businesses with a foundation to solve their vulnerabilities and account for risk. It’s up to you to create cybersecurity solutions; the risk assessment is merely a tool to achieve that.
Even if your IT team consists of a cybersecurity professional, external consultants and other experts can provide your company with more insight, potentially reveal vulnerabilities that your internal team overlooked, and add a broad range of expertise and knowledge to the minds of your staff.
Most of the time, when organizations perform cybersecurity risk assessments, experts identify gaps in a business’s security practices undocumented risks and introduce new threats that weren’t initially in the company’s crosshairs. Identifying hidden internal and external cybersecurity threats could be the difference between saving your company’s data and trying to purchase it from ransomware.
Adaptable risk registers
Risk assessments reveal the most critical and pressing cybersecurity risks your business faces. In most cases, experts will also prioritize those risks based on your company’s resources, core values, and IT team’s capability so you can take immediate action.
The cybersecurity consultants will do their best to provide you with the insight and tools to create an effective risk-mitigation plan. Businesses should use the risk mitigation plan and the consultant’s problem-solving experience to identify how to solve vulnerabilities and address risks.
Understand how equipped your business is to address risks
Cybercriminals and hackers are not the only threats in cybersecurity. Corporate leaders must acknowledge and address non-malicious threats alongside harmful attacks. For example, a business not continually backing up critical data can cripple the entire organization and expose users and customers.
In the event of a power surge, fire, or natural wear and tear of the hardware, companies can face tremendous consequences if they do not mitigate the risk. This principle applies to every threat, scenario, and point of failure.
Risk assessment specialists almost always have or can help you acquire the resources to find vulnerabilities. When searching for cybersecurity consultants, managed cybersecurity services, or performing a risk assessment, consider these factors:
- Technical vulnerabilities
- Governance inconsistencies
- Compliance gaps
- Vendor risks
- Human error
- Risk prioritization
- Risk assessment frequency
- Tools and techniques used
- Business aspects covered in the risk assessment
While not all IT management companies in Philadelphia will specialize in network and cybersecurity, most can provide you with information, system, or cyber risk analyses for businesses to consider their services.

Why Your Employees Are a Cybersecurity Risk
The typical office employee sees more than 120 emails pass through their inbox every day. They have many duties to attend to, from creating documentation to managing projects. Workers are pressed for time and may not look too closely at emails before they send responses. Cyber criminals take advantage of this situation through phishing.
What is Phishing
Phishing emails do their best to look like they’re legitimate. They often have sender names that match other people in the organization or from an external partner. The requests that they make may sound straightforward. These emails have attachments with malicious files or links that try to load malware on the system. The employee gets tricked into installing this software and the hacker now has a way to access that workstation or the business network.
Phishing attacks attempt to steal account information to get into business systems, financial accounts for directly accessing funds, personal information to fuel additional intrusions and sensitive data. In some cases, the cyber criminal is engaging in corporate espionage and tries to retrieve trade secrets.
How to Train Your Employees About Phishing and Social Engineering Threats
“According to Intel, 43 percent of data breaches were caused by internal actors. Of those, 21 percent came from unintentional actions by employees.” Training your staff members is an essential part of a robust IT security strategy. People who aren’t tech-savvy may not know about phishing, or they might expect the emails to be recognizable at a glance.
Social engineering is another attack vector that front-line employees need to know about. Whether it’s someone calling in, emailing or coming to the office in-person, cyber criminals can be effective at tricking workers. They assume the identity of a person who would have good reason to access the information they’re requesting, or visiting data centers and other areas of the building.
Your cybersecurity awareness training program needs to approach this information in a way that’s understandable by employees at all skill levels. They don’t have the same background that your IT security team has, so the information should reflect that.
Allocate enough time and resources to ensure successful training efforts. Employees learn in different ways. Offer instructor-led workshops, online training, one-on-one coaching, written manuals, and other options to encourage completion.
Ask for feedback from the employees most likely to be targeted with a phishing attack. Find out whether they feel better educated about these IT security risks or if they’re still confused about how to identify an attack. Cover what to do if they receive a suspicious email or open an attachment from these messages.
Get Help with Implementing Cybersecurity Awareness Training Programs
You don’t need to have the necessary training resources in-house. A managed IT service company can provide the training materials and workshops necessary to get every employee up to speed on phishing and other threats.
Cybersecurity awareness gives you the opportunity to mitigate IT risks and use more of your IT security resources fighting more complex attacks. Data breaches are a constant threat for businesses, especially if you operate in a higher-risk industry such as finance or healthcare.
Your employees don’t intend on helping cyber criminals break into your business infrastructure. They just don’t know the extent of the risks that phishing and social engineering pose. When you put the right training programs in place; you empower employees with the knowledge they need to become a cybersecurity asset.
