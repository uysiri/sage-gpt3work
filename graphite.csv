6,https://graphitegtc.com/pricing,"Pricing is based on a 12 month agreement paid annually.
* Additional fees required
Graphite Studio™-built web applications take a fraction of the time to build. Our current clients have seen development time drop to 1/8th to 1/3rd the time of traditional means.
Graphite Studio™ built web applications are significantly cheaper than traditional development methods.
The code generated by Graphite Studio™ is in the hands of our client’s right from the start. At Graphite GTC we believe that what you develop with our platform is yours to keep. The generated code is in the form of a perfect Visual Studio Project(s), with documentation in the code, and written to the best design standards.
Graphite Studio™ was developed specifically to build Enterprise Class applications using no-code. All other competitors build departmental applications, applications within a specific vertical or workflow applications that require coding as soon as complex business logic is required for the solution.
Developers using Graphite Studio™ develop locally on their laptop/desktop. We do not lock companies in to using a cloud environment to develop mission critical applications. Because Graphite Studio™ development is done locally we do not track the number of components in your application or end users of the web applications built.
Our pricing model was created with IT budgeting in mind. We believe that our clients should be able to have a concrete development price. Graphite Studio™ has a per month application fee and a per month development seat fee. We do not track components or end users giving CIO’s/CTO’s the ability to budget.
We charge by the application and developer. A single application includes one developer license. You'll need an application license when you are ready to implement and deploy your creation.
Yes, Graphite Studio™ has strategic partnerships with several Systems Integrators in both the Public and Private sectors. Graphite Studio™ also has an in-house elite service division that can be retained.
Graphite GTC considers the Low-Code/No-Code or hPaaS market in 3 different segments all contributing to the innovation of the space. The first segment includes solutions that solely focus on mobile application development. The second segment includes platforms that were built as in-house development tools to save time for specific business process applications such as CRM or BPM and then marketed as hPaaS platforms. The third segment includes solutions that were created to build applications to address the way development has been done traditionally. In this market there are 3 main players OutSystems, Mendix and Graphite GTC. Graphite GTC standing apart as the only No-Code platform to build complex applications to run your entire business.
Graphite Studio™ does not need any proprietary server module for its applications to function. Our generated applications follow code-first MVC software design patterns.
Yes, all Graphite Studio™ generated solutions can be deployed to any cloud environment.
Yes, all generated applications can be deployed to Azure App Service and Azure Sequel.
Yes, Graphite Studio™ does all its versioning using TFS and can seamlessly work with Azure DevOps.
Graphite Studio™ is not a middleware platform. It is a No-code development platform with the ability to integrate with other systems.
Graphite Studio™ has been developed to generate any stack - both current and future. Currently, it generates a full .NET Web application. The artifacts generated are HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, C# and the database is generated using EntityFramework 6.0.
Graphite Studio™ handles all HIPAA and SOX compliance automatically.
Yes, every project built with Graphite Studio™ is generated with security as a focus and is guaranteed to pass any industry leading security analyzer.
Yes, Graphite removes the need for developers to engage in translations. Keywords are used that can later be translated to any language.
1. Test Driven Development
Graphite Studio™ promotes Test driven design by offering the capability to visually create unit tests during the development process. These unit tests are executed and validated prior to deploying to a server for Quality Assurance Testing.
2. Automated regression testing
Graphite Studio™ will directly fit into your current Software Development Life Cycle shortening the development and unit testing phases. If a customer currently has a methodology for build automation and regression testing, the Graphite Studio™ generated application will not change the customers approach.
3. Build automation
Cycle shortening the development and unit testing phases. If a customer currently has a methodology for build automation and regression testing, the Graphite Studio™ generated application will not change the customers approach.
Graphite Studio™ generated applications are completely state-less server side. This allows Graphite Studio™ generated applications to scale horizontally without a need to worry about server-side sticky sessions or other mechanisms for the preservation of server-side state between calls.
Graphite Studio™ generated applications scale horizontally on the Web-tier through the use of web server clusters and as Database requests/demand increases we recommended scaling vertically by increasing the resources available to the Database Server. This is in-line with traditional Microsoft recommendations; scale-out in the Web-tier and scale-up in the Database-tier.
Graphite Studio™ offers an extensive amount of User Interface Elements from our libraries. These UI Elements are used to visually create custom screens based on the customer’s needs. If a new UI Element is needed, the customer can easily include by writing a small amount of JavaScript and CSS. In fact Graphite Studio™ provides a conduit to bring any traditionally developed artifact.

Graphite Studio™ directly supports SQL Server Enterprise, SQL Server Standard, SQL Server Express and Azure SQL. However additional database can be supported by writing a custom Repository layer leveraging our extensibility or service features.
Graphite Studio™ can expose and consume REST, SOAP, gRPC services at the push of the button. It also generates appropriate industry standard documentation for every service that has been exposed in the platform.
When using Graphite Studio™ the customer can create projects that are small to large scale applications. Graphite Studio™ also provides support to build libraries that can be used to share functionality across projects. Any behavior in a library or a project can be exposed as a web service with a push of a button, both gRPC and REST. REST Services generate Swagger (Open API) documentation.
Graphite Studio’s Extensibility and Services features makes it incredibly easy to integrate with any third party system or middleware. A Graphite Studio developer can navigate to any business logic that has been developed and click on an ‘expose’ link to expose that logic as a webservice. They can also consume a service by providing the service contract and letting Graphite generate all the scaffolding required. Consuming external binaries is done in a similar fashion."
