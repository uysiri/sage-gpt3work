6,https://pivotalsolutions.pro/blog/10-benefits-of-working-with-a-fractional-coo,"Are you the CEO of a small business spending too much time working in your business not on your business? Do you feel overwhelmed by trying to manage your team on your own? Does your business need a COO, but you aren’t ready to hire one full-time?
It might be time to consider working with a Fractional COO.
What does a COO do? A Chief Operating Officer (COO) is a business professional who provides COO services to oversee business operations within a company. A Fractional Chief Operating Officer (COO) performs these COO services part-time for a company. This individual supports the CEO/President/Owner by providing CEO coaching and implementing a strategic plan to ensure owner’s, employees’ and customers' expectations are met.
A part-time chief operating officer might work for you anywhere from 2-20 hours a week. And a good one becomes your “CEO whisperer” whom you trust and can turn to for operations support and solutions.
By working with a Fractional COO, you gain knowledge and benefits of an experienced executive who can get things off your plate and done, so you can spend your time on the parts of your business you want to.
Here are 10 benefits of working with a Fractional COO or with a team that provides Fractional COO services:
1. Offers Impartial Insight & Support
Fractional COOs strengthen and solidify you and your team by acting as a leader, motivator and business owner coach. The right Fractional COO team can give you the professional support you need for your small business operations. They will do this after first assessing your business without being biased.
2. Provides Constructive Feedback
Fractional COOs should start by performing a detailed assessment of your business to gain a deep understanding of your company’s goals and operating processes. This allows them to deliver actionable steps for improvement and suggest changes that enable you to move forward toward better practices and greater profit.
3. Helps You Develop Long-Term Vision
A Fractional COO can free you up so that together he/she, your key team members and you can determine the long-term Vision you want for your company. A strong Fractional Chief Operating Officer can then help determine the best ways to achieve this Vision through strategic planning, process creation and improvement, management and other operations-related methods and projects. They can ensure execution of your Vision by Inspiring and holding the team accountable to ensure company values are understood and lived by by all team members.
4. Implements an Operating System
The right Fractional COO can discuss with you how you want your business run long term, so that it is scalable and can involve you less in the day-to-day aspects you likely don’t want to be involved in. He/she can bring to your business and implement what is called an Operating System such as the Entrepreneurial Operating System which helps you get a grip on and better control your business.
5. Improves Team Morale & Productivity
A Fractional COO team can create job descriptions, comp structure, incentives and bonuses. They can also conduct team and one-on-one meetings. This, in turn, provides support, structure, accountability and reward for your team. Since you are too busy and would prefer to not have to oversee the day-to-day, this makes your critical team feel valued and hence they perform better and increase the quality and output of your business.
6. Performs Talent Acquisition
A seasoned Part-Time COO can bring method and process to your staff hiring efforts. Most small business owners/CEOs are frustrated at their efforts to find and hire key talent especially now. A strong outsourced COO can help achieve those employee search efforts.
7. Increases Company Profit
Fractional COOs analyze compensation, conduct annual reviews, and review employment policies to help you determine the right priorities and structural changes needed to support your revenue goals. These professionals also manage risk and spending by driving bottom line small business profit and loss profitability and profit margin percentages. A fractional COO can research and renegotiate vendor contracts improving your vendor services and saving tens of thousands of dollars.
8. Frees You, the CEO, Up to Do What You Want
A Fractional COO can build scaffolding, processes and a team around you. They can handle certain operating matters, and free you from much of the day-to-day fires you likely don’t excel at and don’t like doing. Instead, properly staffed, you can turn to do what you want to - product, marketing, strategy, big picture, selling – whatever you started or decided to run your business for. A proper Fractional COO team, over time, may even help build what is necessary so that you can get some of your critical personal and family time back.
9. Allows for Flexibility
Since Fractional COOs typically work at least partly remotely for your company, they are highly flexible and are able to work around your schedule. An ideal virtual COO may have Associates on their team, so they can flex up or down their time and efforts in providing small business operations improvement.
10. Is Less Expensive and Less Complicated than a Full-Time COO
Fractional COO rates give you access to senior leadership services at a lower cost than a full-time COO, without the time and cost of a search and without costly employer taxes and benefits. Since many small businesses lack the ability to offer salaries and benefits packages that attract top talent, a part-time Chief Operating Officer allows you to spend based on your company’s budget so you only pay for what you need. COO outsourcing also gives you flexibility as you don’t have to worry about the costs and legal issues of letting go of senior leadership if you were to hire a full-time COO and it does not work out.
Fractional COO service providers provide the right tools at the right time. They have the expertise, experience, and operating knowledge that you need for smooth daily operations. Fractional COOs are pivotal strategists and expert communicators who work to make your company a scalable business."
7,https://pivotalsolutions.pro/blog/19-year-old-successfully-launches-his-3rd-business,"(OK, so he’s my son)
Hope you find this story inspirational. Zach Moskow saw a need that wasn’t being met for college students in St. Louis, researched his idea, got classmates to help him, found a venue, did online marketing and successfully launched an event business at Washington University in St. Louis. Read the full story here.
We’d love to hear about what your dreams are for your business and what’s stopping you from achieving them. Maybe we can help you break through your funding, recruiting, operations, coaching, strategy or exit challenges. Give us a call or email us."
8,https://pivotalsolutions.pro/blog/breaking-your-hand-can-make-you-better-at-business,"Ouch! It happened fast and in slow-motion. I was recently helping my son move a mattress into the house, tripped and smashed my hand on our hard asphalt driveway.
Two scraped knees, a pair of lopsided glasses and a shattered fifth metacarpal later, I had to have surgery on my right hand. The result was having two pins in my hand for 6 weeks to keep the bones in place, while also wearing a splint. Funny enough, this type of break was called a Reverse Bennett fracture, and I was on my way to see Tony Bennett perform the night of the injury (don’t worry, the break did not stop us from going to the concert!)
At first I was upset, confused and unsure how to handle the situation. Since I am right-handed, this injury curtailed my ability to perform basic daily tasks such as brushing my teeth, feeding myself and driving. And have you ever seen a one-handed magician? Running Pivotal Business Solutions presented a few more problems. I caught an Uber to our office the next day and sat down at my desk. I was flooded with a sense of dread. How could I possibly work, since keyboarding is so vital to my work – and possibly to my sanity.
Instead of letting my worry control me, I took a deep breath and began one step at a time. I first installed a left handed mouse; although this was initially uncomfortable, I also began to learn to type solely using my left hand.
Then several people suggested dictation software. I started with Microsoft dictate (which I did not particularly like). On the advice of one of my closest friends from college, who is a lawyer and quadriplegic, I moved on to Dragon software. Dragon is amazing. Not only can I now dictate what I want to write, but some things can actually be done faster than when I could use two hands. I’ve now integrated Dragon into my workday. It stays, even when I gain back full functionality in my right hand.
Then, once I got my pins out, I had to begin rehab for my hand. Fortunately, my wife, Amy, is an occupational therapist who specializes in hands. I have all kinds of exercises I must do throughout each day that take time and hurt, but I know they are getting me on the right path.
As I adjusted to life as a lefty, a one-armed typer and to having to do the hard day-to-day work of OT rehab, I learned a new appreciation for others who face long-term disabilities. I also found my experience ironic and slightly humorous. I realized the process was parallel to running a business. Entrepreneurs know that each week different hurdles are thrown in your path. Just like having a broken hand, business leaders who succeed are the ones who learn how to adapt.
How you get to where you are going next often doesn’t matter – rather it is persistence, the tools or methods you use to solve your problems and then doing the hard day-in-day-out work that are most important. Part of most successful solutions includes a few pivots to the unexpected. Often, it includes talking to others, testing new technologies and figuring out what works through trial and error. Of course, if you can tap into advisors who have been through the experience before, you can pivot faster — like calling on my lawyer buddy Joe Gibney who shows me all the time how to leverage technology and to always look at the bright side.
From a psychological standpoint, learning new skills is actually good for your brain. Adult humans’ brains are neuroplastic, meaning that we have the ability to keep learning at any age and to expand the capacity of our brains. Your problem may be the loss of a key employee, operational inefficiencies or market pressures. The ability to be flexible, learn new skills and open up new neuropathways will help you succeed.
This adaptability is truly fascinating regarding loss of hand function. When you have to switch to using your non-dominant hand, there is an interesting form of new learning that happens. Your left hand is correlated with right brain ability, and vice versa. So if you are right-handed, you are primarily left-brained. By being forced to use my left hand I actually began to create new neural networks within the right side of my brain.
The left side of the brain tends to correlate with linear thinking, facts, logic and mathematics, which is primarily what I use in work day-to day. However, the right side of the brain is the brain’s creative hub, related to imagination, intuition, and more holistic thinking. Therefore, over the course of the past few weeks, by being forced to use my left hand only, I likely formed new brain network pathways that I hadn’t used before.
Related to this concept, many experts actually encourage individuals who are not ambidextrous to switch things up every so often. If you write with your right hand, try writing a business letter with your left hand, or draw or even just brushing your teeth with the non-dominant hand to spur brain cell proliferation.
Another interesting thing about accidents and major setbacks is that most people have a set point level of happiness, and bounce back to this point rather quickly. Many of us tend to overestimate how long we will be really happy for if we win the lottery or how long we will be really sad for if we, say, break our hand. Actually, you tend to go back to your usual happiness level rather quickly, whether something really good or bad happens.
It is funny, because this mirrors what we do for our clients. We help them pivot to something better when they get thrown off their set point. Something comes up and blocks them, we help them pivot and change – not give up. If you want to learn more about how Pivotal Business Solutions can help you pivot to funding, hiring, operations or even to life with a broken hand. Give us a call.

9,https://pivotalsolutions.pro/blog/how-philly-tech-companies-are-finding-top-sales-talent,"I have been working with Philly Tech companies for over 20 years. One of the biggest growth inhibitors is finding qualified sales and business development professionals. Although many believe they need more capital to grow, they really need to focus on sales and the sales team because sales drives cash flow – which is foundational to any investor.
Often the biggest challenge is that finding a qualified salespeople is that the search process is a full-time job. And clearly, this is often not the best use of your time and talent.
If you are struggling to fill sales positions with qualified candidates, and the task seems daunting, here are 3 tactics to reduce the time to hire:
- Get really clear on why your company is a great place for sales talent to work. It is a candidate’s market; good talent has multiple offers and your value proposition is vital to attracting the best team members. You need to sell them before vetting them. Build your value proposition into yours job descriptions..
- Use your network. There is a strategic recruiting order of priority when looking for candidates that few people leverage. Start with your employees’ networks. They are often in the same circles of the talent you are looking to hire. Provide your employees with a customizable email template which includes the job description and why they love working at your company. Incent them to do so. Offer them $1,000 if one of the people they find is hired.
- Provide your network with a LinkedIn search string so they can identify connections that matches your ideal candidate criteria. Ask them to copy you and the candidate in an introductory message to make their job simple. Consider offering your network a strong financial incentive for successful hires as well.
Finding the right sales talent to accelerate growth for your company is foundational to meeting your revenue goals. You need a strategic recruiting process, not random efforts to build your operations.
If you are struggling to find the right business development talent, let’s schedule a brief conversation. I am happy to share additional specific strategies that have worked for our clients and can reduce your search time and attract more of the right people, so you can spend more of your time growing your business. I am confident our call will be well worth your time. Call or email today."
10,https://pivotalsolutions.pro/blog/thankful-this-thanksgiving-for-many-blessings,"Our family has a tradition, perhaps not unlike many others, where after our holiday dinner we all take turns sharing what we are grateful for. People mention family, health, friends, a job, food and other vital things. It really is a wonderful experience and has inspired me to keep an ongoing list of what I am grateful for in my life – things that have occurred in the past, things about my life in general and things I am looking forward to.
In the book, The Brain That Changes Itself, author Norman Doidge uses evidence-based stories to illuminate the miracle of neuroplasticity and the power of positive thinking. The acts of gratitude and mindfulness can actually alter our brain and our way of thinking. The book has tremendous examples of transformation brought about in people’s lives who faced incredible challenges, and I highly recommend it.
In my own life, I am extremely grateful every time I volunteer to do a magic show. Last week for Thanksgiving, I did a magic show with my sons at a home for disabled adults. It was such an amazing opportunity and I felt so grateful for having been able to spend time with some wonderful people. These residents, and new friends, face their adversity with dignity and acceptance.
I’ve done magic for over 40 years, and for the past 20 years on a volunteer basis for charitable organizations. Recently, I performed for the Special Olympics and next month again I’ll perform for Families Forward and Variety – The Children’s Charity holiday parties. Every time I get to do magic for disadvantaged children, they laugh, they smile and they have a spark of wonder. They thank me, and I thank them. It’s my honor and pleasure to connect with these wonderful people who are physically, mentally, financially, socially or emotionally challenged. To be able to make them happier even for a brief period of time makes my life real, meaningful and connected. The events themselves and each reflection upon them fill me with gratitude.
As I thought about this newsletter, I wanted to relate the joy I receive from giving to how it helps me and my clients pivot to improved business performance. I am thinking about how the connections I make at the magic shows parallel the connections, partnerships and work I form with clients and colleagues through our work. My hope is that each of you are able to connect with your natural empathy, intentionality and an attitude of gratitude at work. As each of us does this, teams perform better, people become happier and greater success can be achieved.
Please share with me what you are grateful for. Sharing the joy is a critical part of transformation
Most important, if you know of a deserving child-based organization who would welcome a free professional magic show, email me back and I’d love to schedule it."
11,https://pivotalsolutions.pro/career-solutions,"The typical client
The common narrative that there are jobs aplenty or that all one has to do is to go on to Indeed or some such site and find a role, misses a lot of people.
People recently out of college, those who may be stuck, unsure or neuro diverse, those looking for a job less generic or vanilla than some others and those later in their career can find the process of a job search difficult.
Others who are not expert at the search process and understand how important one’s career is want some expert direction.
Some find it has been a while that they have been looking for a new role and are frustrated.
Those in transition who lack the experience in how to determine what role or career choice would be best for them turn to us.
Others are in the middle or latter part of their career and want to move to becoming a consultant, or buy or start a business or franchise or explore other career paths request our assistance.
And some may want to use our services while still in college, so that they can plot their future internships and career best ahead of time."
