I constantly get people who want to learn guitar and have attempted to do so on their own by watching random youtube videos. Having thus realized they are in over their head, they come to me seeking the help of a professional. And every time without fail all they have done is learn bad habits. Bad habits put walls in the way of your development; and these walls start to filter you into only being able to do certain things. I know many talented guitarists who never-the-less have bad habits in their playing; and it always limits them and stifles their growth. They always plateau; never reaching that next big break-through. Your growth as a guitar player should be LIMITLESS, and it will be if you learn the proper technique and coordination that will allow your development to unfold naturally.
Just a few of the benefits of learning to play with good fundamentals are:"

It is my mission to fuel the evolution of humanity; and one of the best tools we have for this is ART. And to me, music has a special place among the arts. Music fuels us like no other art. We love music so much that it can make our bodies move, our hearts soar, it can change our whole outlook on life and existence. Music means so much to each of us; it is both universal and personal at the same time. Music transcends all boundaries.
I look out at the world today and like many I see great music is being played everywhere; except on the radio. Now I grew up in the eighties and the nineties, so I saw an era where guitar playing had reached phenomenal new heights, followed by an age where commercially successful music was dumbed down for the general masses and great guitar players were replaced by mediocre ones. How this came about is a topic of debate I could go on for hours (drop me a line!), but one thing is clear: we still haven’t recovered from this illness. I am appalled at how little most guitar teachers actually know. I have had students that have been playing for ten, even fifteen years come to me who have taken lessons and know about as much as my beginner students (with a lot of bad habits on top of that). It’s time to graduate from kindergarten!
It is my goal to bring real guitar instruction to the masses so that we may better ourselves as musicians, and as a humanity! I teach the knowledge and principles that will allow you to be able to play ANYTHING! It’s all up to you, so if you have the drive then pick up your guitar and get ready to learn!!!"

Chord Switching
Ok, so you’re learning how to play guitar and you’re working on your basic guitar chords (maybe you even have a guitar chord chart on your wall), but like most people approaching playing chords, you’re having a hard time switching chords quickly. Not only that, but you’re probably also finding that getting your chord finger placement, ie. putting all of your fingers in place at the same time, is difficult…
Getting good at putting your fingers down at the same time, and switching chords quickly: these are actually two of the main road blocks I see in the way of students new to guitar time and time again; so learning how to tackle these two challenges in an efficient manner is exactly the focus of this post!
The truth is, both of these skills will get better over time with continued practice. But the good news is there are things we can do so it doesn’t take forever! Because, let’s be honest, it could be a real deterrent if six months or a year from now you’re still struggling with putting your fingers in place and switching your chords efficiently. So I’m going to give you two drills for quickening this process!
Chord Finger Placement
When it comes to chord finger placement, putting your fingers all down at the same time is a high level of coordination that most people approaching guitar simply do not have. So how do we train this fine level of coordination?
Take any chord you are working on; let’s say C Major for this example. Right now you are likely putting one finger down at a time. If you continue to work on fingering this chord, the gap between putting each finger down will gradually get smaller and smaller and eventually you will have the coordination and the familiarity with the chord shape that those gaps will dissapear and you will be able to put all your fingers in place at once. This is the natural progression. So how do we quicken this process?
Here’s the drill: go ahead and put your fingers down on your C Major chord, making sure they are all in the proper place. Now for step 1 of this drill simply depress the chord (don’t lift your fingers off of the strings, just stop pressing down while leaving the fingers in the proper place for your chord). Press your fingers back down, then depress, then press them back down, then depress, etc. So you’re not lifting off the strings yet (you will be touching the strings the entire time); just pressing down to hold the chord and de-pressing while leaving the fingers in place. Be sure to press all three fingers down at the same time each time. Continue doing this for a minute or two until you have a feel for it.
Next, for step 2 of this drill, continue to do the same thing, but now lift your fingers off the strings just a little bit. In other words, don’t take your fingers so far away from the strings that you lose the chord shape and have to refind it. You should be able to put your fingers down on the chord without readjusting your fingers to the proper chord shape (in other words, your fingers are holding the chord shape the entire time as they lift off and go back down onto the strings). Then you lift them back off, put them back down, etc. while still holding your fingers in the proper shape for the chord. If you continue to do this for a couple minutes you will get it; and as you get used to it you can start to move your fingers farther and farther away from the strings before putting them back down.
This is how to quicken the process for getting your chord finger placement down so that you can put all the fingers for a given chord down at the same time. For this drill you don’t need to strum the chord, you are just focusing on your fretting hand.
Plus, more good news, this skill is transferable! You don’t need to spend a lot of time doing it for each new chord you learn. Just do it for the basic chords you are first working on; and as your coordination improves (which is what this drill is accomplishing) you will find that with any new chords you learn you will be able to get used to fingering them much quicker.
Now, if you’re asking “what is a chord change?”, it is simply when you switch from one chord to another; which, when playing music, we need to be able to do quickly. Let’s see how to grow into this skill in a speedy and efficient manner!
How to Change Chords Faster
Ok, now let’s look at how to do a chord switch with your basic guitar chords. We’re talking about your basic major chords and minor chords, but this can apply to any chords you are working on switching between, including chord variations, advanced chord progressions, and even bass chords.
The problem you are facing is likely tied to the first one, of not being able to put all the fingers down at once, only this time you are also having to move in between chords. So you get your fingers in place on your C chord, you do your strum pattern, then it takes a moment before you actually get your fingers in place for your G chord. Unfortunately when you’re playing music the drummer won’t wait for you to switch your chord before continuing the beat, so you have to get good at doing this to timing. So the drill we are going to do is similar to the first one and will quicken the process of being able to switch chords efficiently and to time!
Here’s the drill: Put your fingers in place for your first chord (in this example we’ll use C Major and G Major). So you’re holding a C Major chord. For step one of this drill don’t worry about strumming yet; right now we are just focused on the fretting hand. Now switch to your G major chord, then back to C, then back to G, etc. So in this first stage of the drill you are just working on switching the chord without strumming (we are isolating the switch and getting good at it). Of course, make sure to put your fingers in the right place each time.
Step two of this drill is: as you are switching in the same manner, add one strum for each chord. This reintegrates the strumming hand in a simple way where you can still stay focused on the fretting hand (think about this from the perspective of building your coordination). Do this until it feels natural.
Step three of this drill is to simply add a full strumming pattern to each of your chords. Now you have put it all back together with the fretting and strumming hand and are playing your music!
A Peak Behind the Curtain
There’s a principal of training here that I use with my students: when you are experiencing a problem sometimes it is handy to isolate whatever the problem is and focus on getting good at it. So, for example, say you are playing a four chord progression of Am to C to G to Em. You can switch between all of the chords to timing except C to G. Well then, isolate the problem, and just work on switching between C and G until you can do it to timing. Then, once you’re coordinated with it, you can integrate it back into your four chord progression. So in this example we just fixed the problem of having a gap between your C and G chord (which you can use the above drill for). Now you can play the entire four chord progression without any little breaks (or gaps) in the music and everyone’s happy!
Summary
When I’m teaching students new to guitar I marry up proper basics with building the coordination needed for playing guitar. As a side note, if you get a guitar instructor and their approach is to just teach you chords and parts of songs right off the bat, RUN! The problem with that approach is that it is like taking a child that wants to learn how to swim and just throwing them in the deep end of the pool. It’s like saying, “eh, you’ll get it.” It’s lazy and uncaring, and for most people, it simply does not work. You need to put learning block one into place, and work on building a good foundation from which to grow. This takes not only learning proper basics, but of developing the coordination needed to perform them.
Coordination and Proper Basics: these are two pillars of learning guitar that I use for beginners that we train in such a way that you naturally ascend to being able to connect with and play music!
And for beginners it is important to have these two pillars properly in place. Otherwise it is easy to develop bad habits; and these bad habits will put walls in the way of your development and funnel you into only being able to do certain things. Whereas your growth potential as a guitarist should be limitless, and it will be if you develop the proper foundation!

15,https://divineguitarlessons.com/blog/breathe-in-the-silence/,"Breathe in the Silence
All music is surrounded by silence…
If I’m playing guitar and you walk a certain distance away, you won’t be able to hear me playing anymore; so silence surrounds all music…
If we go out into nature and strip away all the sounds you hear, what is left?
A peaceful silence.
And when the birds or the crickets are chirping, or you hear a stream nearby, it still just sounds and feels like nature.
Even when that calm is disrupted by an animal attacking another animal to eat (and honestly, even those shrieking sounds that alert us, are a part of nature as well), eventually that passes and you are left with the relaxing stillness of nature.
And I’m sure we have all experienced the peaceful, connected feeling we get when we spend some time in a tranquil nature setting; go for a hike, watch a sunrise over the beach, do some paddle boarding, etc.
Let it rest in your mind that silences are very much a part of music…
The Peaceful and Serene
“The peaceful and serene is the norm of the world.” -Tao Teh Ching
There is a Japanese practice, which is now backed by years of scientific study, called Shinrin-Yoku, or forest bathing, where they have studied the effects of being surrounded by trees for even just a couple of hours a week and how healing and therapeutic it is.
There’s a really good book by the Chairman of the Japanese Society for Forest Medicine: Forest Bathing: The Japanese Art and Science of Shinrin-Yoku by Dr. Qing Li
Humans in Nature
We as human beings are animals born in nature. We also have an added element to our makeup: the ego. And this serves a purpose. The job of the ego is to tell us we are a separate being. It gives us the ability to speak of our self as “I”
“I am playing guitar. I rock!”
When we say “I” we are referring to ourself and no one else.
So we have gained self consciousness; we have gained self awareness at a level that the rest of nature does not have. We have gained individual freedom. And this comes with a price; the price of having separated ourself out from the rest of nature. We have lost our natural connection to nature.
The farther back in humanity you go you see a natural connection to nature. Since the development of the ego you see a divorce from nature. As self aware individuals it is now our job to choose, out of our own free will, to reconnect with nature in a healthy way; to be healthy for ourselves, healthy for the world around us. To do so means to take this beacon of freedom we have developed, and hold it high as a torch that shines like a star; not against nature, but consciously in tune with it.
With more freedom comes more responsibility!
Having gained self awareness, we can exist in connection with nature on a higher level.
We are Connected to Everything!
We are connected to everything. Again, it is just the ego that tells us we are separate; and we can see the function of this in the explanation above. We are, in a higher spiritual sense, One with everything! When we breathe, we are breathing with all of the world. You, yourself, are doing it right now!
“Freedom comes in there only being one you; and it includes the table and the computer and the ocean and the trees… You try to breathe without them, you know, and you can’t.” -Jim Carrey
But we forget this. We tend to think of “me” as just this being inside the body.
“My soul is not contained within the limits of my body, my body is contained within the limitlessness of my soul.” -Jim Carrey
Remember: We are all One
The ego can get out of balance. It can be destructive, to the individual, to others, even to the planet. Our large cities, with all of their pollution, are a divorce from nature. It’s a mass conglomerate of people doing people things; not on solid earth surrounded by trees, but on concrete surrounded by buildings. They are a construct of the ego; or rather of humanity, which has as part of our makeup the ego. Other animals don’t make cities; they just live in nature. If they are living in a city, it is because we built it…
(My point here is not to knock cities, indeed they have certainly served their purpose in humanity’s evolution, but to point to the workings of the ego in humanity).
On an individual level, our ego can cause us to be completely out of balance within ourselves, and with our connection to nature and to other human beings. We tend to forget that we are all One, with each other and with all of the surrounding world and cosmos.
Being in Touch with your Creative Center
Playing genuine music is something of deep inspiration. And our inspiration comes from deep within our soul!
It comes from a living connection to our own creative center!
When someone is playing music, you can hear their soul state, and just how connected to themselves they are, so to speak.
And you can hear when someone is playing through a connection with nature; when someone is playing “out of the silence.” In other words, when they understand that all music comes out of silence, or at least have a feeling for being in touch with silence.
There’s a big difference between that and when someone just comes in, kicking the door down screaming and their playing is all self-centered ego (not in the sense of coming in like a force of nature, like a tornado; but like an ego drunk on itself). There’s a certain noise in it, or a certain selfishness that isn’t really good for your mind.
I’m pointing to an extreme case just to describe the difference (note: this is not a description of styles, but of soul states). And with people who tend to lean more toward this end of the spectrum, I find they are usually people who are uncomfortable with silence. In other words, they are uncomfortable with themselves.
You should master the self-discipline of being able to sit in silence with yourself and just be…
It will have a very real effect on your guitar playing!
Music Connected to Spirit
Whether you’re playing something peaceful, or even if you’re playing heavy metal, you can hear (and feel) the difference from someone, like David Gilmour for example, who’s music has been drawn, at least in part, from a higher connection, where they are truly tapping into their creative center; versus someone who all of their striving and motivation, the very median they use to channel their music is from egotism that is centered on me-ness (in other words, an ego separated from its conscious connection to All).
👉🏼 ex. there’s a difference between writing a song when the inspiration comes and you are one with your own creative center, versus taking someone else’s song and just copying it while trying to make it sound like you didn’t copy it…😂
And as we do in fact exist in nature, so too does the ego exist in nature, in us. And an individual that is truly divorced within from nature is divorced from themselves. How can you know yourself if you don’t know or have any sense for the fact that you are a part of everything!
This is the reason why there is something special in the playing of David Gilmour, Jimi Hendrix, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, and of course others. They were a median for something Higher coming in through their music!
And personally, that’s the kind of stuff I love! Music with Soul! Music with a real connection to Spirit! It’s like looking within and honestly expressing what is there… or looking up to the stars and feeling the Harmony of the Spheres and letting that light shine into your music!
If someone can capture even just a glimpse of that in their playing, it’s something special…
And that’s not to say that there wasn’t any ego in there. They are certainly going through the evolution of their ego just as you and I. My point is not to demonize ego. Not at all! The ego is an important member of our being. I am me, you are you.
What I am saying is that it is important to develop a healthy sense of your individual self (Temet Nosce ~ know thyself)… and then to find the connection of your self to All (ex Deo nascimur ~ We are born out of the Divine Spirit)!
Wherever you are on the unfolding of this evolution absolutely is reflected in your music and in your playing!
Living in Harmony
Instead of developing gross forms of egotism, selfishness, and narcissism, we should focus on growing our sense of self in a healthy way that can relax and attune with nature; that can relax in the face of Spirit, that can relax into silence as we attune to Spirit!
A person who does this, whether through meditation, yoga, walks on the beach, or playing guitar, tends to be more internally healthy and able to express genuine human emotion…
We all love deep, raw, genuine emotion that makes us feel more connected to our self! And we love experiences that connect us to the bigger picture (like sunsets on the beach, or the moon rising over the mountains)…
Music is about all of this stuff! Our connection to ourself, our connection to the world, our connection to Spirit…
Finding a sense of Completion
It’s an interesting thing that when we start playing music, our inner stuff starts coming up. Some people just use ego to blow past it (which is something we tend to learn in western culture), and some people choose to work their way through it, to feel and think their way through it.
You start playing in front of someone and make a mistake, suddenly shame comes up, fear of making mistakes and looking bad, etc. You keep messing up, or can’t get your C chord, and you get angry… even down on yourself… 🥀
In connecting to music we are connecting to something that is connected to all of existence, and we are connecting to ourselves.
So it is natural that these things come up, because they are things we are carrying (our ego is carrying) within us. Underneath anger is fear, and underneath fear is shame. And it can be stuff from our childhood or teenage years. A parent left, or was abusive, so we develop a sense of shame that we are not good enough to be loved (there can be many scenarios).
Childhood is messy, because everything is happening to us, and until we begin to ask “Why?” we are as an open vessel accepting everything happening to us without question; and no matter how awesome our parents are, parenting is not a perfect system…
So we all carry stuff from our parents (God bless them). Not to mention all the other stuff we carry from family and cultural conditioning.
It becomes unconscious, because our culture doesn’t teach us how to handle this stuff or how to heal it. Instead we’re taught to ignore it; to move on and keep trying to fit in.
To Play Music is to Go Deep Within
Modern day humanity lives mostly in the upper-ego consciousness, so we’re usually not very good at tapping into our so-called subconscious; or deeper levels of consciousness. And we hold a lot of things there.
And when you play music you are tapping into these deeper levels of consciousness, and so it is natural for these things to come up. Rather than trying to ignore them, I recommend facing them, feeling them out, and letting them go…
In this way music can be very healing!
Getting Clear
I like to think of it as being blocked up…
It’s like we all have this huge shit tank we have to clean. And as we do clean it, eventually the bigger chunks come up; things like traumatic events in our life: a parent dying, a big breakup, etc.
You can tell the people who don’t want to do this work; the ones that are backed up. They tend to be abusive, to get angry at the tip of a hat, and project their stuff onto the world with all kinds of self-importance and egotism attached; even to the point of narcissism where they are saying or doing anything they want to other people, and constantly obsessed with controlling others.
Or it may just manifest in poor self-esteem, and not going for what you want in life (everyone has their own story)…
Most people do not want to do this kind of inner work. They have learned to ignore it all their life and they’re afraid that if they do face their stuff that it will be too intense and overwhelm them! That’s just fear being a player in your life. And like Jim Carrey said, “Fear is going to be a player in your life, but you get to decide how much.”
Don’t be afraid to face yourself! When you do your letting go, you will begin to feel better, to feel more like yourself! You will be more free in a very real sense!
You will find balance in your life
Letting Go
You see, these things we are holding inside, they create patterns in our life. We find ourselves going through the same patterns with the same results, even though they’re different situations.
Well as someone living in our upper-ego consciousness we just want to blow past it and focus on creating a new me, or think our way through it. This is us still just operating through the ego.
You have to be okay with feeling your way through it…
Face it, feel it out, and let it go!
That’s the key that has worked wonders for me and transformed my life!
I invite you try this in your life. When an emotion like shame, fear, or anger comes up; sit with it. Feel it out. It’s ok to have these emotions. Let go of trying to think your way through it and just feel it out.
The realizations will come as you do. You’ll see things from a different perspective.
You can even start with something small, like spilling a little coffee on the desk. See how it makes you feel. Observe the feeling, without attachment. And let it go…
With bigger things it might take a lot of feeling it out, a lot of letting go; even crying it out. And that’s okay.
Be committed to seeing it through as something healthy you are doing for yourself!
If not for yourself, then do it for others. Do it for your family, your kids…
Because when you learn to let go you become a more balanced, reasonable, compassionate person that is healthier for those around you. It’s taking responsibility for your emotions, your inner states, and the things you carry.
Gratitude
On the other side of letting go… is gratitude. You let go of the upsetting emotion of spilling the coffee and you come to an awareness of the fact, “you know what, it isn’t a big deal, and I’m fortunate to be in a position where I can even have good coffee. In fact, I’m so fortunate that I can go make another cup if I like.” Suddenly it turns into a good day and you enjoy the coffee! ☀️ ☕
It’s a way of smoothing out your energy and getting you back to your best self; to the real YOU!
And this works with the big stuff too! My mother left when I was 2. For years it was something that happened to me. And it set patterns in my life that were painful. By facing it, feeling it out, and letting it go (and there was A LOT of letting go to do around it!), I now have an understanding for her, for that part of my life and its function (even from a higher perspective), and I have love and gratitude for her. I’m grateful that she birthed me in the first place so that I can have this wonderful life!
Our normal reaction to this would be to ignore it, hate her, seek mother figures in our life, and do our best to power our way forward through life unaware of the patterns we are living through by carrying it with us…
Best to face this stuff so we can get on with our life, living forward into life as a truly free person, who is cleared of this stuff and can focus on love!
“All you need is love” -The Beatles
Finale
So what is this post really about?
It’s about inspiration.
It’s about working through our stuff so we can get to know ourself and connect to the bigger picture!
And it’s about understanding that Music is a living force that can help us to do this. Music connects us to Everything! It’s a path we walk on. It’s a path of Life!
And so it is that playing guitar is a way of self-knowledge and presence in our life!
“All art works on the same level, and that is Presence!” -Jim Carrey
And when we make a mistake playing guitar we just say, “that’s ok” and keep moving forward! We even laugh it off!
Enjoy playing Guitar!!!
And when shame or fear does come up, don’t ignore it; calmly accept it… Feel it out… Let it go… And keep moving forward, with genuine interest.
“Meisner, one of the tenets of his technique is that if you are actually interested in what you’re doing, you’ll be interesting to watch. And that’s why we watch babies, because they discover things for the first time.” -Jim Carrey
Be at one with yourself through your guitar playing! Be at one with the World!!
Breathe in the silence… and create!"

17,https://divineguitarlessons.com/blog/controlling-your-sound/,"Controlling Your Sound
When playing the guitar, there is more going on than just creating what is heard.
Around all that you need to be in control of the rest of the strings, silencing any that are not being played.
For example, if you are playing the chord of D, the low E and the A strings do not get played. So you need to cover those two strings so that they do not sound and add extra noise.
This is much more pronounced on an electric guitar.
Have you ever turned it up, put it on distortion, and then tried to play a power chord without covering the rest of the strings?
It is easy to get a lot of extra noise that fuzzes up your sound.
So whether you are playing chords or just one note, you need to silence all strings not being played.
I do this by using both hands.
In a chord like D, the thumb of my left hand (I play right handed) is coming over the neck of the guitar and touching the low E and A strings.
For a power chord I let the pointer finger of my left hand do the work, touching the rest of the strings so that they do not sound.
I use any free fingers of either hand to keep my sound under control, depending on what I am doing.
Different situations call for different solutions.
I also use parts of the palm of my picking hand to cover strings.
You need to find what works for you. Feel it out.
As always, listen to how you sound. Listen to every sound you make.
Being a great guitar player takes awareness and listening. It also takes self discipline and the will to get better.
Have fun and Persevere!"
18,https://divineguitarlessons.com/blog/coordination-drill/,"Guitar Coordination Drill for Beginners
This is a basic coordination drill for guitar. Notice that you’re doing every finger combo!
The coordination between any two fingers should be well coordinated for playing guitar. This drill helps you achieve that!
As you ascend you will pick the first note with an up pick, and the second note as a down pick for each string.
And as you descend, on each string you will use an up pick for the first note, and a down pick for the second note…
And last but not least…
This is basic coordination and dexterity drill to help you get coordinated with fingering and picking on Guitar!

Being a teacher you have to learn to go at the right pace for each student.
This takes calmly seeing the student exactly where they are right now!
It also takes a keen, perceptive (and experienced) eye… In other words, knowing the path and how to walk it, along with the ability to see exactly where someone else is on the path; and know how to guide them each step of the way!
In training a student, you have to know when to push them and when to give them their space; otherwise you will suffocate them and they may rightly choose to walk away.
You must be perceptive to your student. You cannot wholly teach out of ego. There must be a balance. For this, you need to have genuine interest and care about people!
It’s great to see people grow into music, but they also need to flourish as a person! Being too strict can also squash their spirit, and I’m all about uplifting your spirit so you can grow as a person and have an amazing life!
Transmitting the Divine
There is also a much deeper aspect to music…
Music is something that is at one with all of existence (inner and outer… and transcends even that!).
Music is Divine.
So as a teacher, you are a transmitter of the Divine!
Otherwise, you are just staying on the surface and teaching out of ego.
In India, a teacher is called a guru, and is seen as one who is transmitting the divine to their student. Thus, a student will touch their guru’s feet, as a way of showing respect. (Obviously not necessary in guitar lessons 😋🤣)
Pictured above is Yogi Guru Paramahansa Yogananda.
As a side note, I highly recommend his book, Autobiography of a Yogi.
Music is Divine

Electronic music is very big these days and is having a huge influence world wide!
Yes, just like any genre, there are some so-called musicians whose creations are not at one with the true spirit of humanities upward evolution. However, there are some ingenious explorations of music happening these days in the manifold forms of electronic music!
I implore everyone to be more open minded and explore the artistic creations of your fellow man.
Personally, I think most of the best music these days is all underground. You have to really search to find!

A great way to explore your chords is to take their shape and move them around. What do I mean by this? Say you finger a D chord. You’ve got covered the 2nd fret of the G string, the 3rd fret of the B string, and the 2nd fret of the high E string:
Now try moving them each up a half step. So now you have the 3rd fret on the G string covered, the 4th fret of the B string, and the 3rd fret of the high E.

Explore! Try strumming the chords as well as arpeggiating them in different patterns. Get creative. This can really help with your writing ability and creativity.
Now do the same thing with a C chord. Move it up from the 3rd fret (A string), 2nd (D string) and 1st (B string) up a whole step. Now you are at the 5th, 4th, and 3rd frets respectively.

24,https://divineguitarlessons.com/blog/feeling-exercise/,"Music Meditation
When it comes to the experience of music, it’s the feel that is important!
As a musician, you are learning to work with the forces of your being, and even the very world and cosmos.
This may sound esoteric, but as you progress in true musical experience, you will find it to be true, and even self evident.
Even our sciences these days speak of visible and invisible forces at work in the world, and in our being.
I am not speaking about things like the movement of the blood. I am speaking about the force that moves the blood.
I am not speaking about the physical body. I am speaking about the forces that make it alive.
As you progress as a musician, you will learn to feel things you have never felt before. And this is okay. There is nothing to be afraid of.
One of the staples of a true musician is creativity; and this takes being open to new experiences.
New experiences bring new feelings and new ideas.
You have to be willing to move forward into unknown areas.
This will challenge your comfort zone.
And that is a good thing!
Often in life, the very things that you need to do the most will force you to step outside of your comfort zone; and being a good musician is no different!
In fact, life and music are one thing. Think this through and take it to heart…
Feeling Every Note Exercise
For this feeling exercise I want you to turn off the lights and to sit down with your guitar.
It should be pitch black so that you cannot see the guitar or anything around you.
Feel free to close your eyes as well. In fact, it is recommended.
Once you have turned off the lights and are sitting with your guitar I want you to play a note. Just one simple note. It does not matter what note it is.
In fact, do not even worry about what fret or note you are playing. Just play the first fret your finger touches.
It is even better if you play somewhere high or in the middle of the fret board so you are less likely to know which fret it is.
Again, it does not matter. The point of this is not to know what fret you are playing, but to concentrate on the sound.
And if you have gotten good enough with feeling the fret board that you know what fret it is, then that’s good, but let go of that thought. Play the note and hold it, letting it sustain.
The point of this exercise is to clear your mind and simply experience the note.
Notice how it sounds; and more importantly, notice how it makes you feel.
When the sound fades, play the note again, continuing to let it sustain.
Just be with this one note and experience it fully.
At first, what will be evident is the sound of the note.
When you continue to focus on it, notice any feelings that arise within you, and focus on that!
Just be and focus on the feeling the note inspires inside of you
Once you feel like you have sufficiently explored this one note, play a different note and do the same thing.
Notice how this note sounds, and how it feels. Notice the difference in the two. Take your time with this.
Focus and be patient, and allow yourself to really experience. These are key principles of being a musician.
Once you have some experience with this exercise, you move on to whole chords, simply experiencing them.
Ultimately you will be able to do this in your playing!
You can even use it to experience whole scales, the switching of scales, the switching of chords, and even whole songs.
If you practice this consistently, letting it deepen you as a musician, it will ultimately change your whole view on music as well as your playing and writing as a true musician.
The Effects of this Exercise
The effect of this exercise is a deepening of your experience of sound and the emotions that each sound brings up for you.
After you have done this exercise for some time, and you can focus on whole chords, you will be able to hear the nuances of sound within each chord. And you will notice how different types of chords make you feel.
And as I said, you can then also extend this to noticing how one note (or chord) makes you feel in comparison to another. To do that, simply play a note as described above, giving yourself time to feel out any emotions that come up for you in connection to that note; and once you have fully felt it out, play a different note and see how that makes you feel; again fully feeling it out.
Then you will be able to flow with the feeling of note to another, of one chord to another and conduct whole pieces of music with passion!
Concentrating on just one note at a time like this will help deepen your experience so that when you hear a full symphony of sounds, or a full band of multiple instruments you will experience this music with a much richer inner experience!
As a musician, this is crucial! But even the casual listener can gain much from this exercise!
I encourage you to actually try it (not just theoretically thinking, Oh yeah I get that, but actually try it!). Exercises such as this leader to a deeper and more enriched inner life and help us to feel more alive and even be more functioning and productive in our everyday life!

25,https://divineguitarlessons.com/blog/finding-the-notes-on-the-guitar-fretboard/,"Finding the Notes on the Guitar Fretboard
Welcome to the art of guitar! Learning your guitar basics, it’s important to learn about the guitar fretboard and understand things like your guitar neck notes, the guitar frets, how to play frets on guitar, etc.
Today we’re looking at understanding the fretboard! More specifically guitar fretboard memorization. And for this I am going to give you some basic reference points to help you with understanding the guitar fretboard.
Maybe these are your first guitar lessons and you’re looking at how to learn guitar fast! Well, I got you covered!!!
To start, here’s a simple guitar fretboard chart.
Notes on Guitar Neck
As you can see, these are all the notes on a guitar…
Now that you have a simple fretboard map (also known as a fretboard diagram, or guitar fretboard diagram), let’s look at some of the simple reference points that make guitar fretboard memorization much easier!
Reference Points
The first reference point is simply knowing the names of the strings on guitar. They are E A D G B E
The second reference point is knowing that the 12th fret is the same note as the open (which you will readily understand if you read the previous blog post):
Knowing this makes you able to essentially cut the guitar fretboard in half, so that you understand that after the 12th fret it’s all the same notes, just one octave higher…
Guitar Notes on Neck – 5th fret
Your next reference point is understanding that the 5th fret is the same note as the next open string (there is one exception: going from the G string to the B string, as you will see below).
For example, the 5th fret of the low E string is the note of A, which is the string underneath that (underneath as in towards the floor):
As you can see, the 5th fret of the A string is the note of D, which is the open underneath that. The 5th fret of the D string is the note of G, which is the same as the open underneath it.
Now, our one exception is that the 4th fret on the G string is the note of B, which is the open underneath it (again, I’m speaking in the laymans term when I say underneath, not in the sense of lower tone since this post is for those new to guitar).
When we move to the B string you can see that the 5th fret is E, as is the open underneath it.
Same notes, same octave!
This is something some of you may know from tuning. Well, it’s also a reference point! Because if you understand that the 5th fret of the E string is A, then it’s pretty easy to figure out that the 6th fret is A#, or that the 4th fret is G#…
Guitar Neck Notes – 7th fret
Another reference point is knowing that the 7th of each string is the same as the open string above it (above as in an upward direction ~ toward the ceiling).
Again, there is one exception, and it is again between the G and B string.
As you can see, for the B string it is the 8th fret that is the same as the open above it: the G string.
These are all the same notes, one octave apart!
This is good to know because, again, if you know that the 7th fret of the A string is E, then it is pretty easy to figure out that the 8th fret is F, and so on…
Fundamentals of Guitar – Octave trick
Ok, one last trick for you!
If you are holding a note, you can skip a string and hold the note that is two frets higher and these will be the same note, one octave difference:
As you can see in the next two examples it is different with the B and E strings: these both have to be up one more fret to get the octave, making them three frets apart:
This difference with the B and E string can be an enigma to guitarists for years… An easy way to think about it, to begin, is to just think that the B and E strings are just one fret higher in relation to the other strings.
Guitar Basics
I hope this helps you with understanding the fretboard and how to remember guitar notes! Your goal should be to ultimately be able to know each note on each string, and these reference points help you memorize the guitar fretboard quickly!

26,https://divineguitarlessons.com/blog/getting-over-stage-fright/,"Getting Over Stage Fright
You know, a lot of people get stage fright when they first get up on stage; even if they have played a thousand gigs before. You start to want to hide; to put up a barrier in front of your heart and keep everyone out. This wanting to hide, to turn away, is something people do (you are not alone). It is an ego defense. Just relax, breathe into the space around you, and let it go. Be gentle with your self, and OPEN UP. We all feel vulnerable sometimes. It is okay to open your heart, even when the spotlight is on you. Just open up and go with it. Everything is okay.
When you do relax, let go of that feeling of wanting to hide, and open your heart you play with more compassion. And other people also feel more comfortable lowering their guard (taking the armor off their heart) and opening up to your music. It makes for a better atmosphere, better energy flow, and better interaction between the band and the crowd. Have the courage to stand there and bare all. Have you ever heard of the technique of public speaking that suggests picturing everyone (including yourself) as sitting there naked? It is like that feeling. Because the truth is, we all are naked. We all have a heart, and our feelings are universal. We all have them. We all have the ability to feel great strength, great joy, and great sadness. Instead of wanting to hide, learn to embrace the feeling. Do not just say, oh if I can just play my parts and get through this I will be okay. Learn to get down to the ground feeling of we are all human, and play every note with the utmost compassion and open heart.
Two people can play the exact same solo correctly: one with an open heart; and the other with the feeling of just wanting to get it over with and hide. They both might even sound exactly the same. But looking more deeply, people’s feelings will be much more stirred by the one playing with an open heart. It will be that much more meaningful. And isn’t that something that music is all about?
Even if you do get up on stage, and that feeling of vulnerability is overwhelming and you just cannot shake it; well one thing you can do is start to focus on your breathing. Feel the out-breath dissolve into all this space around you; and start to surround that feeling with a lot of space. Remember, being timid is part of the human experience. We have all felt that way before. So instead of trying to hide from it, embrace the feeling and keep moving. Some of these feelings and experiences that you normally might try to hide from, are really the juicy parts of life. If you just get rid of them, then you are actually robbing yourself of some of your treasure. Get rid of them and you may suddenly feel empty, and your playing will be practically lifeless. Embrace them, feel them through, learn to let go of the little feeling of self that just wants to hide, and realize that it is okay to play with all your heart (wide open) and you will find yourself playing at the peak of your ability (and maybe even better…)
Again, learn to be gentle with your self. If you are thinking too much and saying oh darn me, I always do this, I’m such a (insert harsh noun); then you will just be a walking battleground, and not the kind of person that people want to open up to. Let’s face it, a big part of the listening experience in a live setting is not only opening up to the music, it is also feeling comfortable opening up to the people playing the music. Everyone wants their favorite musicians to be awesome people, because on some level we have opened up to their music and let it in our heart. Let’s not take it lightly. That is a huge accomplishment: to play music that people actually open their heart to and love. Even just hearing one person say that they love my music makes me very happy.
Maybe you are just saying, “That is all well and good, but how do I get over my stage fright?” Well, if subtle techniques of learning to work with yourself and your environment do not work for you, then honestly you are probably not paying enough attention to detail (the devil is in the details). However, another thing to do is just to put your self in front of everyone and do it anyway. Just do it! And that is not to say that you will ever fully get over that feeling you get when you first get on stage, but learning to face it and deal with it (and even make friends with it and use it), will help you to grow as a person and as a musician. Learn to be more curious about life, and excited when you get on stage. Instead of entering a room and saying, oh no there are all these people; be curious about it all. I personally get excited when I get on stage. I have always loved getting in front of people and entertaining. In school, when I had to get up and read a report or something, I would make it entertaining. I would get people laughing, even mocking the whole seriousness of the situation.
Learn to lighten up. That is really the best advice for getting over stage fright. Let go of all those feelings of self that are making the situation into such a big deal. Let it go, let it go, let it go. Lighten up and have fun!"

Why lies He in such mean estate,
Where ox and donkeys are feeding?

The silent Word is pleading.
Nails, spears shall pierce him through,
the cross he bore for me, for you.
Hail, hail the Word made flesh,

So bring him incense, gold, and myrrh,
Come, peasant, king, to own him.
The King of kings salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone him.
Raise, raise a song on high,
The virgin sings her lullaby
Joy, joy for Christ is born,

28,https://divineguitarlessons.com/blog/guitar-fretboard-notes/,"Guitar Fretboard Notes
If you’re learning guitar then you want to get to know the notes on the guitar fretboard. Looking at the above guitar fretboard chart, it seems daunting, doesn’t it?
Don’t worry, it’s not actually as difficult as memorizing every single fret on each string. There are tricks you can use that make it easy!
But before we look at fretboard memorization, it’s important that you know the names of your strings.
They are: E A D G B E in ascending order.
So the biggest (widest) string is the low E string. The next widest, underneath that, is the A string. Then underneath that is the D string, then the G string, the B string, and the skinniest string at the bottom (closest to the floor) is the high E string.
Notice there are two E strings. The lowest sounding one is the low E string because it has a lower sound. And the highest sounding one is the high E string because it has a higher sound.
Guitar Strings Numbered
When looking at a labeled fretboard you will see the guitar string numbering as such:
E – 1
B – 2
G – 3
D – 4
A – 5
E – 6
As you can see, the high E String is #1, and the low E string is #6.
Understanding the Guitar Fretboard
Every time you move up a fret you are moving up a note, which should be apparent from the diagram above.
If you’re wondering, what are frets on a guitar, they are simply the blocks on your guitar:
As you can see, the frets are numbered starting with 1 and ascending up towards the body of the guitar. Most guitars have anywhere from 19 to 24 frets. The open (when you don’t hold down any fret) is known as the Open, or zero fret.
Now let’s learn the musical notes in order!
Guitar Notes for Beginners
In music there are 12 notes, and they are designated the letters A through G (A B C D E F G – collectively known as the natural notes ~ these are all the white keys on a piano).
If you’ve ever wondered, what is the musical alphabet?
This is your answer: A B C D E F G.
There are also what are called Sharps and Flats (and these are what are termed as accidentals ~ these are all the black keys on a piano).
First let’s look at sharps…
Sharps
The designation for Sharp is simply a number or hashtag sign: #.
Every note has a sharp except for B and E!
So this means our 12 musical notes in order are: A A# B C C# D D# E F F# G and G#.
Again, notice that B and E do not have sharps.
Flats
Ok, if those are our 12 notes then where do Flats fit in?
Simply put, it’s the same 12 notes, just that the sharps are labeled as flats.
The designation for flat is: b.
So here then are the notes in order with flats:
A Bb B C Db D Eb E F Gb G Ab
Notice that C and F do not have flats (because B and E do not have sharps)!
So this means that sharps and flats are essentially the same thing… In other words, A# is the same note as Bb. Or, as another example, C# is the same note as Db.
The term Sharp is also used to say that you are going up one fret (like going from the 1st fret to the 2nd fret ~ you are sharping the note), and the term Flat is used if you are going down one fret (like going from the 2nd fret to the 1st fret ~ the note is flatted).
The Big Question
So now the question arises, “When is a note sharp and when is it flat?”
Well, if we’re speaking of reading musical staff then it depends what key you’re in, but if you’re just learning to play guitar then what I advise you to think about is that a note is sharp if you are ascending:
…and it is flat if you are descending:
So it is important to know that sharps and flats are essentially the same thing, because they are the same notes on the fretboard. Here is a labeled fretboard with sharps and flats represented:
How to Learn the Notes on the Fretboard
Ok, now that we got some basics out of the way, let’s learn how to start learning guitar notes on the fretboard.
There are several approaches you can take:
The first thing I have my students do is start to name the frets on the low E string starting from the open and going all the way up to the 12th fret. Notice that the 12th fret is the same as the open ~ this is the same note at the next higher Octave.
This is just something we will take a moment to do at the end of our lesson. It really only takes about 10 seconds to do.
As they get used to doing this I start to test them, asking “Where is A? Where is B?” etc.), having them fret the note and say which fret number it is.
Once they get their notes down on the E string, we move on to the A string and proceed in the same fashion. We move through all six strings in this manner as they get each one down. How long that takes is really up to you. If you take time to do it once a day, or each time you practice, you’ll get them down in no time!
As you get down all six strings you can then start to get to know the notes above the 12th fret; which are just the same notes at the next higher octave.
And for you bass players, you can also take the same approach if you are working on learning bass fretboard notes!!!
*Side Note: all 12 notes are also collectively known as the chromatic scale*
How to memorize guitar fretboard
Another approach is to name the 1st fret of each string.
At first, you’ll think, “Ok the open is E, so the 1st fret is F. The open is A, so the 1st fret is A#, etc.” That’s ok, everyone does that. Just keep going and soon you’ll have it memorized!
Try ascending up all 6 strings this way!
Now, on guitar, inversion is an important concept. If you do something one way, try its mirror opposite. For this exercise this simply means descending back through all 6 strings naming the 1st fret again; starting with the high E string this time.
Once you get the first fret down, move on to the 2nd fret, then the 3rd and so on…
If the previous approach is to learn the guitar fretboard notes taking a horizontal approach; then this is a vertical approach…
Fretboard ~ Easy Notes
Get started with this approach! In the next blog we’ll look at some reference points that make memorization even easier! And trust me, the further you grow with your guitar skills… the more important knowing your notes on the guitar fretboard becomes!

Heavy Metal is an awesome art form! 🤘
It’s a genre of genius writers pioneering and really creating their own sound!
To me, Heavy Metal is about: Willpower, Focused Dynamic Intent, and Genius!
It’s about far-reaching feelings that are genuine and raw! And it’s also about talent! Some of the best guitar players and drummers (certainly some of the fastest) in the world love playing Heavy Metal!
Into the Pit
For most people who misunderstand heavy metal, the impression they get is one of anger and aggression. And yes, that stuff is out there… But honestly, that’s ok!
Music is a powerful tool for connecting to our emotions; and people are free to connect with their sadness or their anger. That’s a lot better than stuffing it down and taking it out on other people.
Despite the perceived stereotype a lot of people have, some of the kindest, most free-thinking and genuine people I have ever met have been people into Heavy Metal!
So don’t judge a book by it’s cover 😉
Music is something that all of humanity is a part of; and we are all free to experience it and express it however we want!
My personal taste in Heavy Metal is for those who I perceive to be transcending mere aggression and anger and are actually expressing something dynamic, ingenious, and raw.
I look for the talent, and something that really speaks to my soul!
Philosophy in Heavy Metal
Believe it or not, there’s actually a lot of deep philosophy in Metal…
Black Sabbath
“Show the world that love is still alive. You must be brave”
Iron Maiden
“When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you’ll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion”
Dio
“…the magic that we’ll feel is worth a lifetime
We’re all born upon the cross
With the throw before the toss
…We don’t come alone
We are fire, we are stone
We’re the hand that writes then quickly moves away”
Judas Priest
“Racing across the heavens
Straight into the dawn
Looking like a comet
Slicing through the morn
Scorching the horizon
Blazing to the land
Now he’s here amongst us
The age of fire’s at hand”
Motorhead
“Going with the flow, it’s all a game to me”
Metallica
“So close, no matter how far
Couldn’t be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters”
Cliff Burton is my favorite bassist and who I first modeled myself after as a bass player!
God bless you, Cliff!
TOOL
“…So crucify the ego, before it’s far too late
And leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical
And you will come to find that we are all one mind
And capable of all that’s imagined and unconceivable
So let the light touch you, so let the words spill through
And let them pass right through
Bringing out our hope and reason”
If you haven’t seen TOOL live, do yourself a favor… Go see TOOL live!!!
Pantera
“Sometimes when I’m alone
I wonder aloud
If you’re watching over me
Some place far abound
I must reverse my life
I can’t live in the past
Then set my soul free
Belong to me at last
…Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates”
White Zombie
“The siren sings a lonely song
Of all the wants and hungers
The lust of love, a brute desire
The ledge of life goes under
Divide the dream into the flesh
Kaleidoscope and candle eyes
Empty winds scrape on the soul
But never stop to realize”
Megadeth
“Don’t remember where I was
I realised life was a game
The more seriously I took things
The harder the rules became
I had no idea what it’d cost
My life passed before my eyes
I found out how little I accomplished
All my plans denied
So as you read this, know my friends
I’d love to stay with you all
Smile when you think of me
My body’s gone, that’s all
À tout le monde, à tous mes amis
Je vous aime, je dois partir
These are the last words I’ll ever speak
And they’ll set me free”
Death
Chuck Schuldiner was the man who invented death metal! I could dedicate an entire post on the philosophy of his lyrics, particularly in the album “Symbolic.”
I missed my chance to see Death; I heard they had just come through two days before. It was some months later that I heard of Chuck’s passing. He was an influence on me as a teenager with his deep lyrics, cool style, and amazing guitar playing!
Iced Earth
“Can’t you see what’s plain as day
It’s always been there inside of you
One saving grace that’s hard to face
Embracing the truth will change your fate
It’s up to you and the path you choose
To be led to the slaughter or lead the way
The quest for light, a worthwhile fight
Will you have what it takes?
Come what may”
The LIVE Experience
I actually was fortunate enough to see Ronnie James Dio and Lemmy of Motorhead before they died.
It was an outdoor show in Maryland. Motorhead put on a full set, then Dio put on a full set, then Iron Maiden put on a full set! It was an incredible experience!
I’ve also seen most of the bands listed, along with some of my other favorites:
Sepultura, Opeth, Danzig, Type O Negative (RIP Peter Steel), Testament, Iced Earth, Demons and Wizards, Blind Guardian (they’re amazing live!), Ozzy, Slayer, Nightwish, and Dream Theater!
It’s okay if your list differs!
In my opinion, a lot of modern metal is very heavily inspired by Slayer, Pantera, and Max Cavalera (Sepultura and Soulfly); and even Tool for some. I personally like to listen to musicians who I feel are true pioneers of their own sound!
Ronnie James Dio
Btw do you know who popularized this 🤘 and made it a symbol known to Heavy Metal fans worldwide?
I’ll give you a hint:

32,https://divineguitarlessons.com/blog/how-to-hold-a-guitar-pick/,"How to Hold a Guitar Pick
When it comes to holding a guitar pick, hold it with your thumb and pointer finger.
Curl the index finger in and place the thumb over it. Hold the pick with the thumb against the index finger.
Notice that if my thumb is horizontal, the pick is pointing straight down at the floor, at a 90 degree angle.
It’s like holding a key when you’re going to unlock a door.
This is what I have found to be the best way to hold a guitar pick, both for myself as a player of 27 years and through teaching students for 15 years.
How to Use a Guitar Pick
When it comes to how to pick guitar strings it’s important to note that Picking begins in the wrist, as an up and down movement.
Try picking up and down on one of your strings (known as alternate picking).
When you strum chords, the movement still begins in the wrist, and the elbow follows. In other words, it’s a whole arm movement, fluidly moving together!
Correct Way to Hold a Guitar Pick
The reason why we have the index finger in, and not out with an extended position, is because this extends the thumb out…
Which, if we look at it through the lens of proper mobility, internally your thumb connects just behind the wrist, and when we extend it out (as is quite common to do as people are feeling out how to comfortably hold a pick), we separate it from the hand and this can actually do damage to the thumb and wrist over time.
It is also common to lose control of the pick when you hold it in this loose-goosey kind of way (which sometimes results in the picking dropping or going flying) 😋
How to hold guitar pick
So this is what picking looks like when viewed from the lens of proper mobility, or a knowledge of how the body actually works and moves…
How to Hold a Guitar Pick for Speed
For those of you more experienced players, you will notice as you get used to this position that it actually tightens (or hones in) your playing, making your movements smaller and more efficient (and faster)!
So even if this feels a little awkward at first, give it a try and feel it out. It is common for people to need some time to adjust to holding the pick this way, whether you’re a beginner or more advanced guitarist, if it’s not what you’re used to. And this position holds good for both picking single notes and is also how to hold a guitar pick for strumming chords!
It’s not to say that you will never loosen your grip a little, but take this as your starting position and feel it out.
How do you hold a guitar pick?
I’m also not knocking anyone that holds their pick differently.
The law of the jungle is: do what works!
And many greats have developed their own style and positioning of playing as they have figured out what works for them! What I am showing you is what I have found to be the best way to hold a guitar pick in over 27 years of playing and believe me, I’ve been through all kinds of ways of holding my pick in figuring it out! 😂
What I usually see students do after I show them this way of holding the pick is: as they are feeling out using a guitar pick over time they slowly start to expand their position to a more open, extended position; and then over time they start to tighten it and bring it back in to what I originally showed them. Almost like a process they have to go through to realize how to correctly hold a guitar pick, or find the more efficient position for them.
And that’s ok! It’s important for people to explore and see what works for them!
To quote Bruce Lee, “Absorb what is useful, discard what is not, add what is uniquely your own.”
Best Way to Hold Guitar Pick
Again, when learning how to play guitar with a pick there are certainly different ways to hold a guitar pick; and I give plenty of guitar pick lessons to my students so they can explore guitar picking in different scenarios like playing chord arpeggios, triads, soloing, even doing finger tapping with a pick… We have fun!
Guitar Pick vs Fingers
Do you need a pick to play guitar? No, you can also use finger picking. I use both, and they are each their own skill. Some people even thumb pick guitar. Get in touch with me if you want to know how to finger pick guitar for a private lesson.
Here you can see neoclassical shred master Matt Mills (who’s also a friend of mine) holding a guitar pick like I have described:
Guitar Pick Thickness for Beginners
There are many different guitar pick types and sizes. When it comes to choosing a guitar pick, you really want to try a variety of different picks so you can get a feel for what you like. You may find, for example, that you like a thin pick when it comes to the best pick thickness for acoustic guitar; while maybe you think a medium is the best pick for electric guitar.
The different measurements of a guitar pick and dimensions of a guitar pick do vary, as do things you can use as a guitar pick. On the song “I Ran (So Far Away)” by A Flock of Seagulls their guitar player Paul Reynolds reportedly used an english penny as his guitar pick. 😂 Talk about a custom guitar pick! So there’s really no limitation of what to use as a guitar pick!
The guitar pick dimensions, guitar pick shape, guitar pick thickness, etc. doesn’t really matter. It’s all about personal preference. So if you’re asking what can I use as a guitar pick, just get yourself a variety pack of guitar picks and start feeling it out. And it’s natural if you go through different phases of liking a certain guitar pick size for a while, then trying another… It’s all part of the process of finding what you like!
Where to Put Pick Holder on Guitar
It’s also a good idea to get a guitar pick holder. Where you put the pick holder on guitar is up to you! Think about putting it in a place that makes it easy for you to grab a pick while you are playing, but also still looks good on your guitar. I even have a guitar pick holder on my amp!

33,https://divineguitarlessons.com/blog/how-to-hold-the-guitar-proper-guitar-mobility/,"How to Hold the Guitar
Knowledge is power.
And not only that; your ability to work with that knowledge and do… is power.
So today I’m going to show what proper mobility for the guitar looks like!
and answer the questions: “how do I hold the guitar”, “how do I sit with the guitar?” and “how do I stand with the guitar.”
As a bonus, I’m also going to show you how to hold a guitar pick, how to pick the strings of the guitar, how to strum a guitar; as well as how to put on a guitar strap (how to attach a guitar strap), and how to wear a guitar strap (how to adjust your strap to the right height)!!
This will give you a great starting place to feel out these things, like how you’re sitting or standing with the guitar, what’s the right wrist position when playing guitar, where should my thumb go when playing power chords, etc.
Proper Guitar Mobility
I’m going to describe guitar posture when sitting for right-handed guitarists (if you play left-handed guitar, simply reverse it). This will hold true for electric guitar posture and acoustic guitar posture.
You actually have to organize yourself from the ground-up.
So often, if your wrist seems like it’s in a bad position, you can trace it back up the arm, into the shoulders, to the back, to how you are sitting.
Find yourself a good chair or seat that you can sit on with your feet on the floor, where your thighs are flat (not tilted up or down). No sitting back in the couch or on your bed (I use a yoga ball when I teach).
Sit forward, so that your weight is on your feet (not on your butt, like it is if you sit back on your couch).
Your feet should be in front of your hips, facing forward.
Now, take a half step with your left foot (if you are right handed, opposite foot if you are left handed) forward and out at a 45 degree angle. If you draw a line from the toes of your right foot straight over to your left foot, they should be to the halfway point of your left foot.
Proper Guitar Posture
We have organized everything from your feet up to your trunk. Now it’s time to organize everything sitting on top of that; your upper body.
Sit with your back straight.
To organize your shoulders, take them up, back, and then let them drop down. This puts your shoulders in place.
Your shoulders should be square with your hips (not turned to either side).
How to Hold the Guitar
If you hold the guitar flat against your body, you would then have to rotate your shoulders to the left to get your arms in place. However, this would over-extend your left shoulder, and compress your right shoulder (not very comfortable or optimal).
Remember that we want to keep our shoulders square with our hips. (I don’t use classical guitar posture because it has you rotating your shoulders out of alignment with your hips).
So let the neck of the guitar swing forward at about a 45 degree angle. This will have the body of the guitar angling out from your hip.
And let the neck of the guitar be angled upward just a little (not downward).
I tell my students: move the guitar to YOU… don’t fold your self over to the guitar.
If you have followed my instructions properly you will be sitting comfortably with the guitar in an optimal position where you can easily reach all of your frets, with your pick hand in a comfortable position as well.
Take this as your starting point and feel it out.
One of the common guitar posture mistakes is, it’s common for people starting to play the guitar to complain of their shoulder of their pick hand side starting to ache (guitar posture shoulder pain). That’s because they aren’t using correct guitar posture sitting, and are usually slouching, or folding over their guitar (breaking at the lumbar).
All of this is covered in the video above…
Correct Standing Guitar Posture
How to stand with the guitar properly, how to play guitar standing:
Standing with the guitar is literally the same thing…
Stand upright with your feet facing forward. Take your half step forward at a 45 degree angle outward.
Make sure your back is straight.
Organize your shoulders (up, back, and down).
Rock out!!!
How to Hold the Guitar Pick
How to hold the pick: Hold your pick with your thumb and pointer finger.
Notice that if my thumb is horizontal, the pick is pointing straight down at the floor, at a 90 degree angle.
It’s like holding a key when you’re going to put it in a lock to unlock the door.
It’s the same how to hold the pick when playing fast
Picking begins in the wrist…
How to strum a guitar: Strumming also begins in the wrist, but is a larger movement, so the elbow follows (it’s a whole arm movement). Feel it out
How to Wear a Guitar Strap
When it comes to how to adjust your guitar strap to the right height, it often takes years of adjusting your strap high, adjusting it low, before you finally figure out what is comfortable for you.
You want a position where you can easily reach all areas of the fretboard without having to strain or throw your leg up on the monitor speaker and tilt it up just to reach (while trying to look cool doing it).
The thought process that finally led me to the optimal position is this:
What is the most comfortable position to play in?
It’s sitting!
So I adjusted the strap the height it’s at while sitting and playing and voilà! There it is!!!
This means that when you stand the guitar will be at the same height it is while sitting. Try it!
What I find is that I can reach all the frets with ease now!
This is just a starting point… Figure out what works for you!
How to Attach a Guitar Strap
Attaching a guitar strap is easy. It has two holes; one on either end. There are two pegs on your guitar to attach them to: one at the back of the body of the guitar, and one on the top side of the body, near the fretboard.
If you have an acoustic guitar without the second metal peg, simply tie it at the neck of the guitar, just beyond the fretboard. You can use shoe laces to tie it.
When I get a new guitar strap, I put it on and never take it off; because doing so will the loosen the guitar strap hole, and you might find it coming off while wearing your guitar.
You can also get some guitar strap locks to help hold your strap in place (some have a guitar strap button).
If you play bass guitar, you can also get a bass guitar strap.

These are a few of your basic common Principles used in playing Rock Guitar.
You’ve got rhythms using single notes, rhythms using power chords, and rhythms using chords.
Get used to rocking these out!
When learning rock n roll guitar, it’s good to know how to play electric guitar, and how to play acoustic guitar; your rhythm guitar elements like: how to play power chords, how to play basic guitar chords, how to read guitar chords, rhythm guitar vs lead…
You also want to learn your lead guitar elements: the minor pentatonic scale, and even the major pentatonic scale; and as you get used to jamming them learn the full minor scale, and the full major scale.
To go deeper I advise you to learn the Chords in the Major Scale, and for purposes of shredding the entire fretboard, get down the major scale modes for guitar.
I’ll go into some of these Rock Lead Guitar elements in the next blog…
The Deeper Lesson!
The time is Nigh!!!
It is time to put your Divine Sword, Nay Your Golden Ax, to work again, thrashing away the demons of this world with your harnessed Power of Rock!
Never forget that it is a gift of the Gods!
Go now Warrior, you must take up your own quest and earn your place among the Gods of Rock and the great ancestors that came before you! Their sweat was shed and their blood was spilled in the name of something greater than themselves!
We ride for Victory! We ride for Glory! We ride for Triumph over the forces of evil!
For the sake of all that is good in this world!
Now hold your head high… For Rock N Roll!!!
Ride straight to the Misty Gates of Valhalla and forever BE GLORIOUS!!!

I believe in music. This is why I teach. The arts are a great thing in humanity. Through them we express everything! We express our thoughts, our feelings, how we feel happy, how we feel sad, our love, our anger, the feeling we get when we see a beautiful sunrise, the very mission of our life! The very nature of music is to transcend all boundaries. You can communicate how you feel down in the dumps, or how you feel elated. You can also express things that are beyond your known level of experience. You can relate the feeling of being on a mountain top and looking out across a vast valley with other mountain tops sitting above a veil of fog that covers all below. You can relate the feeling of the stars, or of an eclipse. You can also simply play and create, diving into the unknown and expressing feelings and states of being that you did not even know exist.
It is important to face your self; to face the world; and to face the unknown. Be creative and dynamic! Learn to express all things in your playing and in your writing!
To me, the mission of Music is to go beyond all boundaries, and to help humanity reach higher and higher states of being. To evolve! The arts teach us how to live. They teach us how to be. Listening to music everyday is nourishing. Those who hardly ever listen to music deprive themselves of their daily bread. New art, and new forms of art help us to grow; so it is important to be open to and even search for new music. Listening to only the same music over and over, year after year is like being stuck in the past. Sure, it is great music; but you listen to it because of the relation you have with it. It brings up certain memories. You get a certain feeling from it. That is all well and good, it has earned a place in your life, a place in your heart; but be open to new experiences, new feelings. Do not be stuck in your ways. Learn to refresh your self and see things from new perspectives. Are you open to new music? Learn to live with an open mind. Learn to live with an open heart…

Having the dynamic ability to go beyond the rhythm and melody is going to make you a better soloing guitarist. Don’t just focus on one point; surround the rhythm with infinite points!
There are many, many things you can do (endless)…
You may start with a melody, then build it into a more complex melody, then just take off and start flying, and accomplish what I call surrounding with infinite points…
You can hear players like Jimi Hendrix and Joe Satriani do this.
Extend the rhythm into something new and unheard, ever-changing and evolving. Then make it sound familiar again. This interplay is of the creation process!
The actual creating part can sound otherworldly, something totally new!
It’s where you are just flowing and exploring on the guitar with a mind blowing, face-melting solo. Then after the creation you have this finished product that is mobile and moving on its own (the melody that has now come out of the free-flow soloing).
This isn’t just incorporating the talent of jamming into your style (which is important, too), but of pushing the envelope of what is possible on the guitar, whether it’s a solo you made up note for note or you are jamming.
This is important to help you reach higher potentials as a player.
Surfing the Rhythm
Joe Satriani has his metaphor of “surfing with the alien.” In a way, it is like you are letting some higher power flow through you as you play. It empowers you and then you start to sort of lose control and let the solo lead of its own accord before starting to control the chaos; or that is, flow with it and know what you are doing (surf it!).
The knowing comes when you can just let go and be one with it. Eventually you are always at one with it. This is when you play like a real higher level Master that can transcend all the boundaries!
Anyone who is a Jimi Hendrix fan should know exactly what I am talking about!
There are an infinite amount of things you can do as a musician~

Jimi Hendrix was one of the most unique players in that he was constantly going way beyond all the boundaries. As Joe Satriani put it, anyone trying to play Jimi is basically haunted by every note he played, because when he played he took it to a whole new dimension. F didn’t just sound like F; E didn’t just sound like E. It sounded like some other worldly sound; because he did a great job of channeling a lot of passion and Spirit through each note! Spirit is the ultimate trump card. If the energy is good, you’re good! And Jimi’s energy was often through the roof, melting all boundaires and expanding all horizons! He really opened the eyes of so many guitarists and showed the world what the guitar could do! He literally set the guitar on fire!!!
Jimi Hendrix lights his guitar on fire at the Monterey Pop Festival on June 17, 1967.
When Jimi played, even if he was revolving around the pentatonic scale, he knew how to open it up and add all kinds of extra notes and bends in there. Jimi also seemed to have loved to do this thing where if he was playing in a scale (say A minor pentatonic), he would be playing, adding extra notes and bends and all that, and then just out of nowhere slide way up the fret board and take whatever note he landed on and make it sound good (bending it, using the tremolo bar, whatever). He was a master at really transcending the guitar itself and making it an instrument through which he could channel so much… It’s no wonder guys like Joe Satriani and Yngwie Malmsteen share stories of hearing Jimi and it changing their perspective! Jimi Hendrix was one of the most influential guitarists of all time for a reason!!! Rock in Peace, Jimi!"

Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
A day or two ago, I thought I’d take a ride
And soon miss fanny bright, was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank and we got upset
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
A day or two ago, the story I must tell
I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell
A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Now the ground is white, go it while you’re young
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack, you’ll take the lead
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

It is important to know every note on the guitar. No matter what fret you hold on what string, your goal should be to be able to know each note without thinking twice. Start by learning the names of each string. The use of an acronym is helpful (ex. Eddie Ate Dynamite Good Bye Eddie), but eventual you should be able to name them: E A D G B E
There are certain reference points that will help you keep tabs on where you are on the fretboard. The dots, for starters, are there for you to reference what fret number you are on. The single dots are on odd numbered frets. The double dot is on the 12th fret. The 12th fret is the same note as its corresponding open string, just one octave higher. For example, if you are on the E string, then the 12th fret is…E. The same goes for every other string. If you are on the A string, then the 12th fret is A. If you are on the D string the 12th fret is D, etc.
Next, get to know the relation of the fifth fret to the next higher string. The 5th fret is the same note as the open string underneath it. For example, the 5th fret on the E string is the note of A. The 5th fret on the A string is D. The 5th fret on the D string is G. Now here is where it gets a little tricky. The 4th fret on the G string is B (not the fifth). There is a reason for this, but for now just get down the relations of each string and remember that for the G-to-B it’s the 4th fret. Now lastly, the 5th fret on the B string is E. And that is all six strings!
There are other things that can help you to know the fret board; but use these as a starter. Get to know them well.
Know your guitar. Love your guitar. Thank your guitar :p
Thank you!

An exercise for learning the notes on the fretboard:
Pick a note to locate (for example E) and set your metronome to 65. Then proceed to locate that note on the 6th string in all positions with each click of the metronome. Proceed to the 5th string (without missing a beat), then the 4th string, the 3rd string, the 2nd, and finally the 1st, locating the note on each string. Don’t forget the open string positions.
Try this with all 12 notes. If 65 is too fast, then slow it down. Once you are proficient at it, feel free to test yourself by speeding it up. Those just starting out may need to reference a note chart, which will show you all the notes on the fretboard, such as:

The way I teach beginners is I have a series of a few simple drills that help you get coordinated with fretting and picking the strings; and as you proceed they introduce you to playing to timing. Practicing these drills for one week will help you gain the coordination you need to begin playing music! Let’s begin!
Practice Drill 1
Staying on the low E string, play the 1st fret with your pointer finger, followed by the 2nd fret with your middle finger, then the 3rd fret with your ring finger, and the 4th fret with your pinky. Then go in reverse.
Try it a few times; doesn’t have to be perfect. Just work on getting your finger behind the metal bar each time and getting it to sound as good as you can!
Next, try it on the A string:
I recommend doing it a few times on each string!
BACKING TRACKS:
For drills 2, 3, and 4 I have audio backing tracks for you to play along with. They help you develop good timing, which is important to do from the start. Plus it makes it more fun and helps you drill it for longer; as well as develop the focus you need as a musician!
Go to: https://soundcloud.com/dgl-7/sets/practice-drills
Practice Drill 2
Use your pointer finger for the 2nd fret, and your middle finger for the 3rd fret. Once you finish with the sequence, start over (at the open).
*Play this drill with the backing track labeled: “Practice Drill 2 – 60 Bpm”
https://soundcloud.com/dgl-7/2-practice-drill-2-60-bpm?in=dgl-7/sets/practice-drills
Practice Drill 3
Use your pointer finger for the 2nd fret, your middle finger for the 3rd fret, and your pinky for the 5th fret.
*Play with the backing track labeled: “Practice Drill 3 – 60bpm.”
https://soundcloud.com/dgl-7/practice-drill-3-60bpm?in=dgl-7/sets/practice-drills
Practice Drill 4
Use your pointer finger for the 3rd fret, your ring finger for the 5th fret.
*Play with the backing track labeled: “Practice Drill 4 – 90 bpm”

In this post what we’re going over is how to play the major scale in any key, as well as understanding intervals and triads (chords in scale).
All western music is based on the major scale, so this is very foundational stuff that will give you a solid base for understanding and using music theory!
Let’s get started…
G Major Scale:
Above you see a fretboard diagram of the G Major scale. The notes in red are simply the root note (tonic note). Here is the tablature for it:
G Major Scale Tab
Formula for the Major Scale
The formula for the major scale is:
whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, whole step, half step.
A whole step is moving two frets, a half step is moving one fret~
Major Scale formula: W W H W W W H (W=Whole step, H=Half step)
Thus, the major scale is made up of seven notes!
By starting at the root note, in this case G, and applying the above formula, you get the seven notes of the G Major scale: G A B C D E F#
How to Play the Major Scale in any key
To play the major scale in any key simply find that key on the low E string and play the same finger pattern. It’s that easy! This is one of the beautiful things about guitar: our scales have universal shapes!
A Major Scale:
By applying the same major scale formula and starting with the root note of A, we get the A major scale!
It consists of the notes: A B C# D E F# G#
F Major Scale:
So if you start at the root note, this time F, and work through the major scale formula then the notes for the F Major scale are: F G A Bb C D E
C Major Scale:
And here is the C Major scale: C D E F G A B (all the whole notes)
How many major scales are there? 12!! One for each note!
So you can do this same major scale pattern starting on any note on the low E string and you will play that notes’ major scale!
What’s a Whole Note in Music?
A whole note is simply all the notes without a sharp (#) or flat (b): A B C D E F G
What’s an accidental in Music?
An accidental is all the notes that have a sharp (#) or a flat (b): A# Bb C# Db D# Eb F# Gb G#
Intervals
Let’s look at a basic concept that is important in the language of music theory called Intervals.
An interval may be described as the difference between two notes, or the relation of notes in scale (for example, a major third, a minor third, or a perfect fifth). Let’s look at the main intervals, as these are the intervals of the Major and Minor scales.
In the Major scale, the 1st note is known as the root, the second note as the 2nd, the third note as the Major 3rd, the fourth note as the perfect 4th, the fifth note as the perfect 5th, the sixth note as the Major 6th, and the seventh note as the Major 7th.
In the Minor scale, the 1st note is known as the root, the second note as the 2nd, the third note as the Minor 3rd, the fourth note as the perfect 4th, the fifth note as the perfect 5th, the sixth note as the Minor 6th, and the seventh note as the Minor 7th.
The difference between the Major scale and the Minor scale is that the Minor scale has a flatted 3rd, 6th, and 7th. That is why the interval name for each of these notes is differentiated between major and minor (for example, major third versus minor third).
If we look at the G Major scale versus the G Minor scale, the notes are:
G Major: G A B C D E F#
G Minor: G A Bb C D Eb F
As you can see, the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th are all the same. The 3rd, 6th, and 7th are all flatted in the minor scale. This is true for every key.
(I am planning on covering the minor scale in a future post…)
The term perfect simply refers to the classical definition of the 4th and 5th whose sound is considered a perfect consonant. For the purpose of understanding the matter at hand get used to counting the notes in scale.
Counting the Notes in Scale
So, for the purpose of understanding the basic language of guitarists we will look at counting the notes in scale.
If we take the G Major scale, again it consists of the notes: G A B C D E F#
To reiterate, in the G Major scale, G is the 1st note in scale (known as the root), A is the 2nd, B is the 3rd, C is the 4th, D is the 5th, E is the 6th, and F# is the 7th.
Try naming the notes of G Major on your guitar. You will see that they follow this sequence. After completing all seven notes, notice that they simply repeat again at the next octave, as shown here:
Now, still using the G Major scale, count them out:
So if someone says “G’s third,” they are talking about B; because B is the third note in the G Major scale. Or if you say “G’s fifth,” you are referencing D; because D is the fifth note in the G Major scale. If someone says, “Go from G to the 4th,” they are saying go from G to C (the 4th note in scale).
Triads
There is one more important thing to discuss, and that is TRIADS!
This will give you the definition of what makes a chord as well as lay the foundation for your understanding of how chords and scales go together.
A Chord is defined as three or more notes played together. Chords are made from Triads!!!
A MAJOR TRIAD comes from the major scale, and is made up of the 1st note in the scale (the root), the 3rd note in the scale, and the 5th note in the scale.
Root, Third, and Fifth! A major chord consists of these three notes. For example, the triad of the G Major chord consists of the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes in the scale of G Major, which are G, B, and D. These are the three notes that make up a G Major chord.
A MINOR TRIAD comes from the minor scale, and is made up from its Root, Third, and Fifth! A minor chord consists of these three notes.
For example, the triad for the E minor chord consists of the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes in the scale of E minor, which are E, G, and B. These are the three notes that make an E minor chord.
Note: The difference between a major triad and a minor triad is that the minor triad has a flatted third. (To flat means to take a note down one fret).
A DIMINISHED TRIAD consists of Root, flatted Third, and flatted Fifth.
So a diminished triad has a flatted 3rd, just like a minor triad, but it also has a flatted 5th! A diminished chord consists of these three notes. For example, the triad for F# Dim is F#, A, and C.
Major Triad = Root, 3rd, and 5th
Minor Triad = Root, flatted 3rd, and 5th
Diminished Triad = Root, flatted 3rd, and flatted 5th

Summary
In this post I covered the major scale for guitar and went over such topics as: how to play a major scale on guitar, major scale steps, major triads, minor triads, and diminished triads, as well as scale degree names, and knowing the tonic note.
I also answered the questions: how many notes are in a major scale? What is the pattern for a major scale? What is the formula for a major scale? Since these are common questions…
So if you’re searching for: what is a major scale? There’s your answer! Major scale construction in a nutshell!!
In the next few blogs I’ll cover Knowing all the Triads in key, the Minor Scale, and how the major and minor scales connect! That way you’ll be clear on major and minor keys, and you’ll know just what does major and minor mean in music, and you’ll have a deep understanding of how chords and scales go together, as well as a solid foundation for your understanding of all music theory!

In this post I will go over the 7 modes of the major scale!
I will also teach what the term Natural Minor (aka Relative Minor) means…
7 Modes of the Major Scale
To begin, you can basically think of a mode as a position in the major scale. These are the major scale patterns!
The first mode will start on the 1st note in the scale (the root note), the second mode will begin on the 2nd note in the scale, the third mode will begin on the 3rd note in the scale, and so on for all seven notes in the scale.
There are seven notes in the major scale, so there are seven modes of the major scale; known as Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, and Locrian.
- Ionian mode
- Dorian mode
- Phrygian mode
- Lydian mode

7 Modes of the G Major Scale
Here are the seven modes of the G Major Scale:
1st mode – G Ionian
This is the 1st mode, the G Ionian mode (or G Ionian scale), which you can also simply refer to as the G Major Scale.
Notice that it starts on the 1st note in the scale, the root note of G.
2nd mode – A Dorian
This is the 2nd mode of the G Major scale, known as the A Dorian mode (or A Dorian scale). It starts on the second note of the G Major Scale, which is A, and then proceeds up the same seven notes you see above in the G Ionian Mode.
So, yes, we are still in the scale of G Major, this is just the second position of it; or the second mode.
3rd mode – B Phrygian
This is 3rd mode of the G Major scale, known as the B Phrygian Mode (or B Phrygian scale). It starts on the third note of the G Major scale, which is B.
4th mode – C Lydian
This is the 4th mode of the G Major Scale, known as the C Lydian mode (or C Lydian Scale). It begins on the fourth note of the G Major scale, which is C.
5th mode – D Mixolydian
This is the 5th mode of the G Major scale, known as the D Mixolydian mode (or D Mixolydian scale). It begins on the fifth note of the G Major scale, which is D.
6th mode – E Aeolian – Natural Minor
This is the 6th mode of the G Major scale, known as the E Aeolian mode (or E Aeolian scale). It begins on the sixth note of the G Major scale, which is E.
Notice this one is also labeled as the Natural Minor. I detail what that means below…
7th mode – F# Locrian
And this is the 7th mode of the G Major Scale, known as the F# Locrian mode (or F# Locrian scale). It begins on the 7th note of the G Major Scale, which is F#.
Major Scale Modes Guitar
These are the seven modes of the major scale! Above they are presented in G Major. Again, this is the G Major Scale! Being able to play all seven modes listed above will give you the ability to play the G Major scale all over the entire fretboard!
Next, I will show you how to play the seven major scale modes in any key!!!
How to play the Modes of the Major Scale in Any Key!
To play the seven modes of the major scale in any key, simply begin the 1st mode (your root note) on whichever fret that is on the low E string.
The other modes will simply follow the notes in that given key.
For example, to play the modes of the F Major Scale, begin the first mode on the 1st fret of the low E string, which is the note of F:
7 Modes of the F Major Scale
These are seven modes of the F Major Scale:
1st Mode – F Ionian
2nd Mode – G Dorian
3rd Mode – A Phrygian
4th Mode – Bb Lydian
5th Mode – C Mixolydian
6th Mode – D Aeolian (Natural Minor)
7th Mode – E Locrian
You should notice that the pattern for each mode is the same as it was above in G Major. So it is important to get down the pattern of each mode.
These are the major scale patterns! Learn to shred them!!!
Natural Minor
The 6th mode is known as the natural minor because it is the Minor Scale!
The other term you might here for this is Relative Minor. It means the same thing. Relative Minor is interchangeable with Natural Minor.
So if you look above, the sixth note of the G Major scale is the note of E (which is where the 6th mode starts).
This means that the E Aeolian mode (6th mode of G) is the E Minor Scale.
In F Major the 6th mode starts on the note of D (the sixth note in the F Major scale). So that is the D Minor Scale!
To summarize, every major scale key has a natural minor, and this will be whatever the sixth note in the scale is.
So guess what, you just learned the 7 modes of the minor scale as well!!!

For the sake of getting down this concept of triads I want you to pick out the triad for the following major chords.
To do this, I want you to count out the notes, 1st 3rd and 5th, using the first mode of the given key.
CHORD: F Major
ANSWER: F A C = F Major triad/chord
Again, F, A and C will be the only notes in an F Major chord:
Let’s look at another one.
CHORD: A Major
ANSWER: A C# E
So A, C# and E are the notes that make an A Major Chord:
Let’s continue. Again, using the 1st mode, count out the 1st, 3rd and 5th to discover what makes a D Major chord.
CHORD: D Major
ANSWER: D F# A
D F# A = D Major Chord
Let’s do one more.

Here’s something extra for you 😉"
55,https://divineguitarlessons.com/blog/minor-scale-for-guitar/,"Minor Scale for Guitar
In this post I will cover the minor scale on guitar, as well as the scale formula for the minor scale, how to play the minor scale in any key, how to identify intervals by counting the notes to understand what makes a minor 3rd interval (scale degree names), etc.
Also, the difference between the major Scale and minor scale, and what makes a minor triad and how that makes a minor chord 🤘
Let’s dive in!
Minor Scale Guitar
Ok first let’s look at how to play a minor scale on guitar!
A Minor Scale
This is the A minor scale! Notice it’s all the whole notes (A B C D E F G), the piano scale for this would simply be all the white notes!
The notes in red are simply the root note (the tonic note).
And here is the tablature for the A minor Scale:
A Minor Scale Tab
E —————————————————————————————-5–7–8
B ————————————————————————5–6–8—————-
G ——————————————————-5–7————————————-
D ————————————5–7–9—————————————————-
A —————–5–7–8———————————————————————–
E 5–7–8—————————————————————————————-
Formula for the Minor Scale
The Formula for the minor scale is:
WHWWHWW
Whole Step, Half Step, Whole Step, Whole Step, Half Step, Whole Step, Whole Step
(A whole step is moving up two frets, a half step is moving up one fret)
This gives us the seven notes of the minor scale!
So by starting at the root note, and then proceeding up using the minor scale formula of WHWWHWW you get the minor scale.
This is true no matter what key you are in; you just start at the root note and walk up the fretboard using the formula.
Once you’ve gotten to the root note at the next octave, the formula simply repeats; giving you the same seven notes in the next octave.
Whole, Half, Whole, Whole, Half, Whole, Whole
How to Play the Minor Scale in Any Key
To play the minor scale in any key, just find the key you want to play it in on the low E string, and then play the same scale pattern (or shape) that you played for the A minor scale above! This will, of course, follow the same formula just explained…
Here’s a few examples:
G Minor Scale
Above you see the G Minor Scale. Notice that it has the same shape as the A minor scale, but is just starting on the 3rd fret of the low E string, which is the note of G.
Here’s another example:
B Minor Scale
Again, you should notice that the pattern is the same, just starting at the root note of B, found on the 7th fret of the E string.
And here is the D minor scale:
D Minor Scale Guitar
Minor Scale Intervals
In the previous blog on the Major Scale I explained what Intervals are, as well as the major and minor scale intervals.
Essentially we are just talking about the difference between two notes (whether the next note in scale is a whole step away or a half step away ~ which is actually fully explained in the formula for the scale ~ WHWWHWW).
Intervals also relates to the relation of notes in scale, which is what we’ll look at here.
Major and minor intervals simply refers to the notes in either the major or minor scale. In this blog I’ll explain the minor scale intervals more deeply.
The first thing you want to get used to is simply counting the notes in scale:
In the minor scale, the root note is the 1st, the second note is known as the 2nd, the third note as the minor 3rd, the fourth note as the perfect 4th, the fifth note as the perfect 5th, the sixth note as the minor 6th, and the seventh note as the minor 7th.
The Difference Between the Major Scale and Minor Scale
You’ll notice that some of the interval names for the minor scale had the word minor in them (ex. minor 3rd). This is because these are the notes that are different in the minor scale.
What I mean is, the difference between the Major Scale and the Minor Scale is:
the minor scale has a flatted 3rd, a flatted 6th, and a flatted 7th
(in comparison to the major scale)
To flat means to take the note down a half step, or one fret.
So if you compare the A minor scale to the A Major scale you will notice that in the A minor scale the third note, the sixth note, and the seventh note are all down one fret (they are all flatted).
This means that the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th notes are all same!
This is the difference between the major and minor scale.
So when we speak of the minor scale we speak of its 3rd, 6th, and 7th as being minor.
Minor Triads
Ok, the last thing we’ll discuss in this blog are minor triads.
Minor Triad = the root, 3rd, and 5th of the minor scale.
So if you look at the A minor scale above you will see that the root is A, the 3rd is C, and the 5th is E.
This is what makes an A minor triad: A C E
How to make a minor chord on Guitar
A minor triad is what makes a minor chord!
So if you look at an A minor chord it simply consists of these three notes: A C E
This is true no matter what version of the Am chord you are holding, like a barre chord:
That’s how to play an A minor chord on guitar.
Guitar Chord B Minor
A Bm chord is simply made of the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of the Bm scale:
B D F#
How to tell if a triad is major or minor
When comparing a major triad vs a minor triad, a minor triad simply has a flatted 3rd in comparison to the major triad (which, if you will recall the definition from the last blog, a major triad = root, 3rd, and 5th of the major scale).
So the difference is the major 3rd vs minor 3rd.
For example: an A Major Triad = A C# E, and an Am Triad = A C E. The third is flatted.
Guitar intervals explained 🖐️🎤
A minor key signature just refers to the song being in a minor key, such as D minor. And a minor chord progression would just be a series of chords in that key (which is something I will cover in the next blog on chords in scale). I will also be discussing what a natural minor scale is.
Summary
So in this blog I covered such cool topics as the minor scale and intervals (what is a minor 3rd, etc), tricks to remember intervals, minor scale positions on guitar, etc.
In the next blogs I’ll show you how to play the major and minor scale all over the entire fretboard, and how to know the chords that go with any key!!!

Let’s get down minor triads!
In the previous post “Major Scale Exercise” I gave you an exercise for understanding major triads.
Now let’s do the same for minor triads!
Pick out the root, 3rd, and 5th from the minor scale to get the corresponding minor chord
CHORD: D minor
ANSWER: D F A
D minor chord = D F A
Let’s continue..
CHORD: A minor
ANSWER: A C E
So an A minor chord is made up of the notes A C and E
Again, you are pulling out the 1st, 3rd and 5th notes from the minor scale (known as a minor triad) to determine what notes the given chord consists of.
CHORD: E minor

And in my experience, one of the main aspects of this whole music thing is having an open heart.
Living with an open heart; and this is healing.
In fact, it’s so monumental and personal at the same time, that this healing occurs on the individual level, of healing you, healing your heart, and even healing the earth.
This very aspect of music’s influence in our life is so profound and subtle at the same time that it teaches us to transcend everything on all levels.
Music is life
I listen to music everyday; it’s my daily bread.
And I encourage everyone to really focus on the creative source that is music, and to really bring the fruits of music to the table of your life. It’s so important! It’s so encouraging; and it makes you feel.
Open your mind.
Open your heart, and allow the music to live inside you.
It can be everything, if you let it.
Music can be your friend, it can be your love; it can be your guide.

O holy night! The stars are brightly shining,
It is the night of our dear Saviour’s birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining,
‘Til He appear’d and the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! O hear the angel voices!
O night divine, O night when Christ was born;
O night divine, O night, O night Divine.
Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming,
Here come the wise men from Orient land.
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friend.
He knows our need, to our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!
Behold your King, Before Him lowly bend!
Truly He taught us to love one another;
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother;
And in His name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! O praise His Name forever,
His power and glory evermore proclaim.
His power and glory evermore proclaim.

Getting to know your musical theory (chords, scales, modes, etc) is important, but keep an open mind to the fact that there are endless things you can do on a guitar. Learn to be at one with the creation process. This is important even in learning music theory.
You can learn chords and scales, and start to see that there are many, many ways that it can all relate. In fact, the more you learn, the more possibilities open up for you as a player and as a writer.
So really tackle and sink your teeth into the knowledge you learn; and don’t make the mistake of thinking that you have learned all there is to know about it. Rather be open to the fact that there is always more to be revealed to you…
Learn to express this in your playing, and learn to explore the endless possibilities of the guitar and of music!

When it comes to playing sports, have you ever noticed that some people pick it up almost right away and get really good, and others take time to develop? That’s simply the nature of being human. And the people that do take more time getting good stick to it because it’s something they want. They have a passion for it!
There is wisdom in letting development unfold as it will.
“Do not rush to early ripening,” it reads in the Tao Teh Ching.
In fact, many of the greats do not become so right away. Michael Jordan, known as one of the, if not THE, greatest basketball players of all time, stated in his autobiography that growing up, and even through high school and college he always felt inferior to his older brother as a basketball player. His brother’s jersey number was 45, and Michael Jordan picked #23 because he wanted “to at least be half as good as his brother.” Well, we all know what a champion Michael Jordan grew to be in the pros!!!
Another quote from the Tao Teh Ching is: “Great talents often develop late.”
So again, there is wisdom in allowing yourself to develop at your own rate. Your focus should be to put the time in to your practice so your development continues.
And have fun!
Guitar Training
There was a great line from Terry Silver in Cobra Kai where he was teaching his “Quicksilver Method” and he spoke of the three D’s of being a champion: Desire, Devotion, and Discipline. And he says, “The first two I cannot give you. The third I can.”
This speaks greatly of the responsibility of the student if they do wish to reach their full potential in this life, as well as the role of the teacher. In guitar, the teacher can teach you your chords, scales, time signatures, etc. but they cannot make you practice at home throughout the week. That is up to you as the student.
And to be fair, not everyone who learns guitar wants to become an Eddie Van Halen or a Joe Satriani. And that’s ok! To reach such a height, to reach the summit of your own mountain top and attain mastery, requires TOTAL focus and discipline. You have to be the person sitting in their bedroom or in the basement playing for hours everyday! It has to be one of the, and usually THE main focus of your life! It takes hours and hours and hours of playing!
Learning Guitar
And not everyone has such a goal for themselves; and that’s ok too! Most people are focused on things like their school life, their career and work life, their family; and for them playing guitar is a fun hobby they enjoy. And that’s awesome! Whether you want to climb your mountain, torch in hand, and shred with the masters, or you want to just be able to play some chords and strum some songs hanging out on the beach with your friends; whatever your motivation is, playing guitar is a great choice of a peaceful life! And that to me is a great gift!!!
The real point is to just enjoy guitar playing so that it becomes something that adds real value to your overall enjoyment of life! And not to rush to early ripening, but simply to steep yourself in your practice, in your training, with however much time you have, and allow for your development to unfold as it will. Let go of trying to force things, and simply enjoy your guitar practice! As the Beatles said, “Let it be.”
Developing Guitar Skills
Above I mentioned the technical aspects of learning guitar like chords, scales, etc. that the teacher can teach you. Well, what’s also important is your ability to actually understand and use these things to be able to play music. And that takes time…
And it’s equally important for the teacher to have a keen eye for where you are in your development and give you these elements as you are ready for them. In other words, not only when you have formed a proper welcome in your soul for them, but when you are ready to use them!
A teacher can dump all the music theory on a student at the very beginning, but it will in large part be a waste because the student has no idea what to do with this knowledge. Yes, the student could take thorough notes and spend the following years training them on their own. But the solitary path is not for most, as Myamoto Musashi (known as Japan’s greatest swordsman) points out in his legendary Book of Five Rings.
So it is best, if you are dedicated to guitar lessons, for the teacher to always have a keen eye for exactly where you are so they know how to help you grow right now! In reality, dumping all knowledge on you at once in the beginning would be likened to having a plant ready to grow and just dumping ten years of water on it at once. The plant would drown and probably never grow!
Being Creative
The other aspect I’m pointing to here is that while there is the sort of left-brained, technical aspects of playing guitar (learning chords and scales, etc.) there is also the purely (intuitive/emotional/creative) developmental side of PLAYING MUSIC!
Knowing power chords is one thing. Knowing HOW TO ROCK THEM… is another!
So a large part of learning guitar is also simply getting better at playing music using what you have learned. And again, if you allow yourself to just enjoy playing guitar, and let go of all expectations (expectation leads to disappointment!) and learn to open up and LOVE learning and playing then you will be on a good path!
“If it is a path with heart, then it is a good path!” –The Teachings of Don Juan by Carlos Castaneda
Genuine Connection
I also find it key for the teacher to just check in with the student from time to time and have a connecting discussion about how the student feels, what they are thinking and focused on. Because a large part of learning from a teacher isn’t just, “here’s a bunch of cool guitar stuff, learn this and you’ll be awesome!” It’s also about the connection that develops and exists between teacher and student. From a teachers perspective there is also wisdom to that because what everyone is really seeking is genuine connection.
This is also to say that if the teacher is teaching something, but the student is stuck in one spot thinking something that never gets addressed and isn’t quite ready to follow the teacher to the next thing, then what can happen is the teacher keeps moving forward with their teaching, but the student stays in the same spot; so the teacher moves farther and farther away from them.
So there’s actually a responsibility on both teacher and student to speak up, openly share their thoughts, and connect in real time (and of course this should always be done with respectful gratitude for each other). If you do keep a personal touch to things and keep the connection alive, checking in and having the right discussions from time to time, then there will always be plenty of food on the table for everyone!
Growing into your Art
Even in spiritual development it is often taught that you don’t want to rush to try and force results, but should work on yourself diligently and patiently await what is to come; as was intelligently elaborated by Rudolf Steiner in his classic novel, Knowledge of Higher Worlds and Its Attainment. As he points out, those who try to force a vision of the spiritual world before their chakras (spiritual sense organs) have properly developed will only get an incomplete view of the spiritual world.
I am reminded of the song “Harvest” by Opeth when Mikael Akerfeldt sang: “Wilted scenes for us who couldn’t wait.”
Whether you are spiritually inclined or not, what I am inviting you to get from this is simply in the nature of learning and growing into your art.
Patience and Persistence are key!
So keep your Spirit Up, have fun and Rock On!!!
Music is a blessing
Having music in our lives is such a blessing! Not that long ago, if you didn’t play an instrument or know someone who did, you didn’t hear music! Now we have music from around the world at any time at the touch of a button! That’s incredible!!!
And playing music is a Godsend! Just imagine a couple hundred years ago wanting to play an instrument… Well you better hope that you even have access to one, and to a good teacher! So we are quite blessed to be able to learn.
The humble truth is, every step on the path is a blessing. The fact that we can sit down and play some guitar for a time means that right now we have been afforded a moment of peace. It also means that our health is good enough to allow for our good fortune of being able to play some guitar. So life must be okay right now in this moment. We’re doing okay. And we should count our blessings!
Even the fact that you are reading this blog post right now means that you have a free moment to enjoy life and learn something. I’m going to guess that you’re not getting shot at, at this moment, or suffering through a major surgery. If you are and you’re still reading this… then what a dedicated champion you are! lol 😆
Life in Every Breath
There’s a great line from The Last Samurai where Katsumoto is speaking of the Way of the Warrior and is defining Bushido: “To know life in every breath, every cup of tea…” That’s living life with awakened gratitude!!!
There’s another great line where he says, “The perfect blossom is a rare thing. You could spend your life looking for one, and it would not be a wasted life.” Then in the end when he is dying he looks across the field, and as it is spring in Japan, he sees a cherry blossom tree in full bloom and remarks the revelation, “They are all perfect!”
Every breath is a blessing! And on a very fundamental level, the fact that you are breathing and able to read about guitar means there is more right with you then wrong right now 🙂
Guitar Practice
My friend and I like to use the analogy of a bee. You see it flying around, trying to land on the blossom to do its work. The wind blows and the flower moves, and it looks like he’s having a hard time landing on the flower. It looks kind of clumsy. The truth is the bee is actually quite efficient (and dedicated!). And so it seems like the bee is just busy all day long doing his bee work. The beautiful truth of it is, though, the bee gets to do this work!
And so it is with guitar… We get to play guitar! We get to practice so we get better!!
It’s a blessing of having the time, the means, the good health and physical ability of being able to pursue playing an instrument; and we should always carry gratitude in our mind and love in our heart for this chance to achieve something higher than ourselves! Something that adds enjoyment, peace, enrichment to our lives as we get to pursue something we have such a deep love and appreciation for: Music!
Walking the Path
And sure, I understand the growing pains of working on getting your chords sounding good and switching between them to timing. But that’s part of the path! And better to steep yourself deeply in each moment of learning and really feel it out and think it through; really approach it with Heart! That’s how you get the most out of your learning; because each step of the way there is fruit to be had: in the small successes, the lightbulb moments, even the mistakes!
It is actually only our own ego that thinks of it as not being perfect. You are actually meant to be exactly where you are right now, doing exactly what you are doing… And that includes messing up a chord 😆 So better to laugh it off and keep enjoying what you’re doing. Instead of getting upset when mistakes happen, or about not progressing as fast as you think you should, let me offer you the perspective of having humble gratitude and love for yourself and your life, as well as this opportunity to do something as awesome as learning music! When we make mistakes we just laugh it off and say, “That’s ok too.”
Development tends to happen in ways we don’t notice. We’re not aware of the incremental progress; it’s only when we make a big break-through to that next plateau that we realize “Hey, I’m getting it!” And everyone thinks of each plateau as a stuck spot (“I’ve plateaued”). Actually you should explore each plateau as thoroughly as you can. Enjoy this beautiful place you’ve landed! That’s what will prepare you for making that next big break-through; that ascension to the next level!
The seed is not the rose yet, but it is perfect
The stem is not the rose, but is perfect
Even the imperfect blossom is perfect
🌹
“They are all perfect”

Grab your electric guitar and turn on your favorite distortion for leads! A great technique to add to your bag of tricks is playing a note, and then touching the same string twelve frets higher. So for example, play the fifth fret on the G string. Now, while letting that note continue to ring, touch the seventeenth fret on the G string with the middle finger of your pick hand. You just need to lightly touch it, not push it down to the board. You will have to keep holding the fifth fret while you touch the seventeenth fret.
Now let us take it a step further. Do the same technique. Hold the fifth fret, play it, then touch the seventeenth fret. Now bend the fifth fret. Try bending it up and holding it; and also try bending it back and forth (up and down). Try bending it a quarter step, a half step, and a full step. Explore this technique. You can also try bending with the tremolo bar after you touch the seventeenth fret."
62,https://divineguitarlessons.com/blog/pick-hand-harmonics/,"Pick Hand Harmonics
To create a harmonic with your pick hand, allow part of your thumb to touch the string as you pick it. This is done while holding the pick. As you pick the string, turn your thumb slightly down so that the outside edge of your thumb touches the string at the same time. This technique is best accentuated on an electric guitar with a good distortion. Practice this until you are impeccable at it!
Now, still using the pick hand harmonic technique, try bending your tremolo bar (whammy bar) up and down after you pluck the string. This is a great technique to really add some flavor and WOW to your soloing."

Sure, if you are playing a song where you want to nail every note the way it was written then stick to it and show the achievements of your hard earned discipline and refined skill. I get it.
But when it comes to just picking up and jamming (which is just as important of a skill), learn to let go and go with it!
Let it be. Let it flow. Play like a child!
Free Flow!
This free flow of play can actually help you be a much better musician.
Playing like a child, you do not worry about sticking to the rules you learned. When you’re soloing or just jamming around, you freely go outside of your box of learned scales and familiar chord shapes, arpeggios, triads, etc. and you just start stringing things together, not worrying about what it technically is; even trying the notes that aren’t in scale to see how you can get more sound. It’s fun!
You can always break it down later and get technical (could be useful!); but it’s a skill to go outside of the mind and just play!
Play from experience, but also explore something new! Be dynamic and discover!
This is how you learn to effectively break the rules! Maybe you do some things that do not sound so good, but that’s ok. It helps you learn!
Freedom in Music!
Just remember, there are no wrong notes!
In learning the guitar, to borrow a saying in martial arts, you should learn the rules, stick to the rules, dissolve the rules!
Starting out, learn your chords, learn your modes, and learn how to put it all together. Then stick to it. Drill the basics.
If you keep pushing forward as a true artist, the progression will naturally lead to transcending it all!
The nature of music is to transcend everything!! So you learn to dissolve the rules, and go beyond the text book basics.
However, it is important to start by learning and drilling the basics. Do not just try and skip it all and get to the end. You will only be robbing your self. “You gotta crawl before you walk!”
But when you’re actually playing, especially if you’re jamming, no how to let go of your lessons and just have fun! It’s okay to lose yourself in the moment!
Have fun!
So be sure not to be too serious all the time! Take some time to play around with the things you learn.
Also take some time and forget about everything you are learning and just play. Play like a child: free and going with the flow!
Being a musician means, among other things, learning and expressing freedom of the human spirit!
This will help you mature as a person, but even as you mature do not make the mistake of thinking that you are above playing like a child!
Have fun!!!

64,https://divineguitarlessons.com/blog/playing-to-timing/,"Playing to Timing
As a guitarist your intent should be focused on playing with perfect timing. When playing music, timing and rhythm should be foremost in your mind. As you progress, this will come naturally; but it takes years of hard work. Perfect practice makes perfect, so for the next drill you need a metronome or some kind of beat machine (something that plays beats to perfect timing). I prefer playing to a beat than a metronome, as it is more fun, sounds better, and gives you good practice for playing to drums. Set the tempo to 100 or even slower if that is too fast. Listen to the beat and get a feel for it. Notice each element of it; the bass drum, the snare, the high hat, etc. Also notice when the beat starts over/repeats itself. If your beat machine has a choice for time signatures then choose 4/4 timing. As you advance you can explore other timings, but 4/4 is the most straight forward and easy to understand. It is also the most common time signature in modern day popular music.
As the beat is playing, count out the tempo: 1 2 3 4. After 4 you go back to 1. At 1 is where the beat starts over again/repeats. Once you have a feel for the beat, including recognizing the tempo, you can start the exercise. The more you do this the easier it will be to recognize the tempo and structure of a beat.
Start off by choosing a chord (such as E minor) or even a simple power chord. Play your chord at the beginning of the beat. Each time it comes around, each time the beat starts over, you will strike your chord. Be sure and do it perfectly at the first hit of the beat. Once you get a feel for this, add a second chord or power chord and play it at the half way point of the beat. So if you count your tempo as 1 2 3 4; then at 1 you will play your first chord, and at 3 you will play your second chord. As the beat starts over you will repeat this. Do this until you can perform it with no mistakes. As your timing gets better, you can play more complex rhythms to different beats. I encourage you to follow this path of growth, always aiming for perfection!"

In the last blog on rock n roll guitar I introduced some rock guitar basics, and we talked about things like power chords, basic open chords, palm muting, and shredding guitar riffs…
So we took a good look at rhythm guitar to get you rockin!
Now if we’re looking at rhythm guitar vs lead, we can see that with lead guitar you also wanna get good at playing guitar solos.
In this article I’m going to introduce you to some of the elements you need to know to play lead rock guitar!
Let’s start with some basic scales commonly used in rock guitar.
Pentatonic Scale Guitar
This is the A minor pentatonic scale for guitar:
As you can see here the minor pentatonic scale is presented in A minor.
You can play it in any key by finding the root note on the low E string and then playing the same pattern.
For example, here is the F minor pentatonic scale:
See how it’s the same pattern?
This scale is widely used in rock music of all ages, so get good shredding it!!
There’s also a major pentatonic scale you can learn, but honestly I recommend learning the major scale, which we’ll look at below or you can learn all the major scale modes here.
Rock Guitar Techniques
Here are some rock guitar techniques using the minor pentatonic scale that you can work on:
Minor Scale Guitar
Once you get used to soloing with minor pentatonic scale, I recommend getting down the minor scale.
As you can see, it’s very similar to the minor pentatonic scale, with a couple of added notes that make the full minor scale.
Am scale:
This is the A minor scale. Just like the minor pentatonic scale, you can play it in any key by finding that key on the low E string and playing the same fretboard pattern.
The Bm scale:
An important concept is that whatever key your rhythm is in, solo with the scale in that key!
So you can use the Bm scale with a rhythm in B minor.
Practice Soloing
Backing tracks are a good way to practice your solos. There’s plenty on YouTube.
Here’s a Bm backing track to get you started:
Excellent! Hopefully you’re getting a feeling for using your scales over rock rhythms!
If you wanna hear how I solo over this track you can check that out here:
The Major Scale
Ok, we’re gonna tackle one more scale commonly used in Rock music: the Major Scale!
G Major Scale:
This is the G Major scale. It will work with a rhythm in G Major.
Here’s a G Major backing track for you to practice with:
Just like our other scales, to play it in any key simply find the root note along the low E string and play the same fretboard pattern!
For example, here’s the A Major scale:
Here’s a few links for a full description of the Major Scale, all 7 major scale modes and the different chords that go together with the major scale Triads in the Major Scale.
Here’s one more video for you to teach you some awesome lead guitar techniques for Rock N Roll!
Rock N Roll Guitar Summary
So, just like it’s important with rhythm rock guitar to know things like how to play electric guitar, how to read guitar chords, power chords, how to play f chord on guitar, how to play c chord on guitar, how to play ab chord on guitar… with lead rock n roll guitar you want to know things like the minor pentatonic scale, the minor scale guitar, and the major scale guitar…

You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen,
Comet and Cupid and Donder and Blitzen.,
But do you recall?
The most famous reindeer of all?
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose,
And if you ever saw it,
You would even say it glows.
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names;
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games.
Then one foggy Christmas Eve,
Santa came to say,
Rudolph with your nose so bright,
Won’t you guide my sleigh tonight?
Then all the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee,
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,
You’ll go down in history.

67,https://divineguitarlessons.com/blog/similarities-of-learning-guitar-and-learning-martial-art/,"Similarities of Learning Guitar and Learning Martial Art
Learning guitar and learning martial art are very similar in nature. Playing guitar is like a mini martial art of the fingers.
You have to work on moving from position to position (chord to chord ~ and fluidly moving across the fretboard); using just as much movement and force as is necessary.
You have to figure out what actually works in a real life situation (actually playing music/actually being in a real life combat situation), and what is a waste of your time.
As Bruce Lee said, “Absorb what is useful. Discard what is not. Add what is uniquely your own.”
There also tends to be a lot of internal growth that develops as you train and get better. In the book of five rings, Myamoto Musashi said if you want to get good at sword, practice guitar. The arts compliment each other and help you grow!
Way of Life
In the martial arts your training is not considered to be separate from the rest of your life.
Instead, it is all about your way of life!
This is why it is common in the Shaolin temple for example, to see as part of the daily training, not just physical training in the martial arts, but focus on things like meditation, developing virtues, and healthy eating habits.
Self-discipline is practiced in all areas of life; because it is about growing your entire self, your entire life!
And so it is with training in music…
It impacts all of your life!
I have known friends who, through playing guitar, it really shaped who they are, and even kept them out of trouble as teenagers.
It also tends to come with a call to morals, or a call to virtue, where they sense internally the need to live as better people.
In other words, it helps them get in touch deep inside themselves with true living moral impulses.
My students know that I have trained in martial arts for years, and even taught for some time, and it is something that is important to me. I also draw from my martial art experience, and what I have learned from the amazing sensei’s I have been blessed to have, in how I teach.
And the truth is in music, just as in martial art, if you want to get better you have to practice!
And both are about genuine self-expression!
It’s ok to learn from other guitarists, but ultimately you must learn that what you are really exploring is yourself. And you must learn to genuinely express yourself in your playing, and not just imitate others.
WuDe: The 10 Virtues of Shaolin
How you live is how you play!
So, to finish this post, in connection with I’m talking about, I would like to cite the ten virtues of Shaolin; because these are very inspirational and in line with actively developing yourself passionately in how you live!
These are pulled directly from the headmaster of the Shaolin Temple Europe, Shi Heng Yi 释恒義
1) Humility can only arise when one is willing to control one’s pride and to practice in overcoming it. Satisfying one’s own desire is not to be placed above all else.
2) Attention is the basis of all relationships with humans, animals and all beings. This also includes the respect for oneself. It is the foundation on which the Shaolin community is build upon.
3) Righteousness is an attitude towards life. What is rightful to do, you should do and what is wrongful to do, you should not do. Taking responsibility for your own actions is expected.
4) Trust includes trustworthiness towards others and also your ability to trust in yourself. Each practitioner of the Shaolin Arts should develop a personality that can be trusted without reservation.
5) Loyalty may be the most important of all the virtues of action and behavior. Loyalty is the basis of trust and any relationship. Those who are missing it or can’t develop it, won’t proceed.
6) A strong will is necessary to not lose sight of our goals and to intensively study the arts. An iron will, can be advantageous, at the same time it may not be used to the detriment of other beings.
7) Perseverance means to practice and train incessantly. This applies both to the physical and mental development within the Shaolin Arts. It is expressed by the continuous effort to work on oneself.
8) Persistence enables us to detect mistakes and to correct them. Persistence never lets a Shaolin practitioner become tired of improving oneself and expresses in the capability to withstand hardship.
9) Patience enables us to continue even when there is no understanding of the meaning of the practice, or if a goal seems inaccessible and unreachable. It is expressed by self-discipline and calmness.
10) Courage is necessary to learn the Shaolin arts and to act properly in difficult situations. It enables us to attain a state of the mind which is rooted in confidence to overcome our fear or anxiety.
For most of my closest friends and I, training in music, training in martial arts, working out, eating healthy, developing ourselves as good human beings, and growing our spiritual life consciously… is all a part of who we are and how we live!
I invite you to think about your way of life, and integrate these principle virtues consciously into the core of your being!

68,https://divineguitarlessons.com/blog/soloing/,"Soloing
When it comes to soloing, creativity, flexibility, and dynamic ability are paramount. You may solo fast over a melody with a fast tempo, matching or even increasing the speed. You can also do the opposite and play slow over a melody with a slower tempo. Also consider soloing fast over a slow melody, and slow over a fast melody.
Now consider mixing it up and doing a combination of these techniques to add dynamics to your solos. You may be soloing slowly, then pick it up and solo fast; or you may do the opposite and start off soloing fast and then slow it down.
There are infinite combinations you can do, and having a changing melody behind you can also add a lot of dynamic sound and flavor to the mix. Practice soloing alone as well as with different melodies to discover different sounds, styles, and techniques. It will make you sound better, and it will make playing that much more fun!
Are you a blues player? Try playing some heavy metal! Are you a metal musician? Try playing some blues, or some jazz, etc. Strive to be a well-rounded musician."

70,https://divineguitarlessons.com/blog/spanish-guitar-and-spanish-flamenco-guitar/,"Spanish Guitar and Spanish Flamenco Guitar
Spanish guitar, and Flamenco guitar, both use common scales, such as the major and minor scale, as well as the Harmonic Minor Scale: and uncommon scales like the 8-tone Spanish scale.
A Harmonic Minor Scale
There’s also a really cool scale used in Spanish Guitar called the 8 Tone Spanish Scale:
8 Tone Spanish Scale in C
Open Hand Picking
Often times, it is the style of picking and/or strumming that makes it sound so fast!
A cool style of Spanish Guitar strumming, which does not use a pick but rather just the open hand, is to pick down on the bass note with the thumb immediately followed by strumming up with the fingers. Try it!
You then continue quickly by strumming down with the fingers and up with the thumb.
So it has a quick 1, 2, 3, 4 timing.
⇓ bass note with thumb
⇑ with fingers
⇓ with fingers
⇑ with thumb
Go slow at first to get the motion down, then gradually increase speed until you can do it very quickly (control before speed every time!).
Traditionally, this style has also been added to by doing the same strumming style just listed, and continuing by adding a hit (on the guitar body), a strum down with the index finger, followed by a strum up with the index finger, and finishing with a strum down with the thumb.
Again, this is traditionally played very fast, so work hard to perfect it!
Once you get this down you will be able to play many traditional Spanish guitar and flamenco pieces…
So all together:
⇓ bass note with thumb
⇑ with fingers
⇓ with fingers
⇑ with thumb
Hit
⇓ with index finger
⇑ with index finger
⇓ with thumb
Spanish Guitar Strumming Pattern
Another common Spanish Guitar strumming pattern is to use the index finger and the middle finger and strum down with the middle finger, then down with the index finger, then up with the middle finger, and up with the middle finger. Get this down to the point where you can play it very fast:
⇓ middle finger
⇓ index finger
⇑ middle finger
⇑ index finger
Try playing this with a 4/4 timing using the chords of E major, F major (bar chord), and G major (bar chord) to get a very traditional Spanish Guitar sound.
Spanish Guitar Finger Picking
As you can see, Spanish Guitar tends to utilize finger picking. Spanish guitarists are also famous for doing an upstroke with the fingers where you let them rake upward. So instead of creating the sound of one up stroke, it creates the sound of several simultaneous up strokes. For a good example of this, look up the song “El Toro.”
Another great was Carlos Montoya
Learn Finger Picking
Also, for single notes, practice using your index and middle finger, and picking up on a single string. First pick up with your middle finger, followed by picking up with your index finger; then repeat. Try doing this on one single note. As you get the feel for it you can switch notes. Get good at this so you can do it really fast.
The trick in the picking hand is to Relax!
⇑ middle finger
⇑ index finger
An advanced form of this finger picking style is to do the same as before, pick up with the middle finger then up with the index finger, and then pick down with the nail of the index finger (top of the finger nail), followed by picking down with the nail of the middle finger (again, top of the finger nail).
So the down strokes are like a rake, but done on one string (as you advance you can do it on multiple strings).
It’s a continuous thing that you do very fast. Again try playing it on single notes, then practice moving around the fretboard as you continue this quick picking pattern.
⇑ middle finger
⇑ index finger
⇓ nail of the index finger
⇓ nail of the middle finger

71,https://divineguitarlessons.com/blog/style/,"Music is an Experience!
The most important thing to playing any style is the feeling…
Certain styles tend to use certain scales, types of chords, song arrangements, etc (for example, a lot of blues and rock makes use of the Pentatonic scale, and heavy metal makes use of the minor scale and the harmonic minor scale); but the point is to get the feeling and to push the envelope of any style, and even make up your own style.
No style should be limited to a certain set of parameters. Music should not exist inside a box.
Music is a living art! Once you learn how to play the blues, push the envelope with it~
Becoming a Well Rounded Guitarist
Learning more than one style will also help you to become a well rounded musician.
Many artists who play rock, such as Led Zeppelin, have learned blues and learned how to incorporate it into their style.
Alex Skolnick, the lead guitarist for the heavy metal band Testament (he has also played in Trans Siberian Orchestra and his own jazz trio called Skol Trio), has learned to play many styles; and this is what allows him to be such a dynamic lead guitarist.
Learning more than one style will allow you to be a better musician!
Explore New Areas!
Again, certain styles do traditionally have certain trends to them, and you can learn a lot by learning through these. If you really know your stuff then you will be able to challenge the comfort zone of any style you learn and take to new areas of discovery.
Learn to put soul into your playing!
Put some real feeling into your playing!
Otherwise you will just be a text book guitarist…
The foundation of all these known styles has already been laid down by others (and God bless them! Let us be thankful!)
In music, there are the pioneers, the true creators of their sound; and there are the millions of followers who have learned to reproduce the trends of a given style. And that’s ok too!
Music is something all of humanity is experiencing and is a part of! And we are all free to experience and express it how we may!
Learn to push the envelope so you can be a true pioneer of your own musical experience!
Play with Love and may your journey be on a path with real heart! 💛
Music is a Connection
In music we are connecting with ourselves on a deeper level. We’re connecting with others when we play for them, and when we dance with them. Music is something connected to everything! Music can literally fit every occasion! It’s something that connects us to our lowest lows, and our highest highs! We can experience it alone; we can experience it with others…
What’s an experience you’ve had with music that was meaningful for you? What’s your story there? And why is it so meaningful for you?
I bet you have an incredible story. One that shows how genuine you are, and what your values really are…
I encourage you to write down this story!
Seriously, take a few minutes to write it out (not just hypothetically in your mind; actually sit down and make the most out of this exercise). You’ll learn something incredible about yourself! I bet you’ll feel reconnected to yourself in a gratifying and refreshing way, whatever the nature of your story! It may even be healing for you!
A Story we Both Share
Here’s a song I wrote that came out of a story we both share. (What is that? Watch the video and you’ll know EXACTLY what I’m talking about, because it touched both of our lives deeply!). I invite you to open your heart (not turn away and hide), and let your memory and your emotions arise. Feel them out… Experience them… Heal.
Are you feeling it? Did it make you reflect?
I know, we went kind of deep on this one, but hey, this is life. Let’s live it to the fullest! Let’s not be on the turning away, hiding from our experiences, hiding from our own emotions. Music is an absolutely amazing tool for helping you feel out your emotions and face your life!
What is it that You like about music? Does it help you dance? Does it motivate your work day? Maybe you use it for meditation! Exploring music is a journey we are all on, and we are exploring it unique to our own experience, and we are experiencing and exploring it together!
It’s great to be on the path with YOU!
Thank you 🙏

When it comes to playing different musical styles, teaching you little licks that only work in a certain context will not cut it. You need to actually be learning how to play those styles with your own understanding and freedom of creativity. This is what most guitar books lack. Music is a living force, so what you learn needs to be actionable!
What I am going to teach you here are certain principles of each style that will help you be able to explore that style on your own; which is what it’s really all about. One of the best ways to learn how to play a certain style is and always has been to listen to that style and get a feel for it.
So what I am trying to teach you is not a certain flavor, but a way of training yourself where you can realistically learn and grow into your own as a guitarist and musician.
You be the Chef!
I don’t want to be a chef handing you certain flavors, I want you to be a chef and come up with your own recipes and flavors!
We will look at different techniques, and scales and chords that are commonly used in these traditional styles; but more importantly I am giving you tools to grow into any style of your choosing and to create your own style.
I also encourage you to learn different styles as this will make you a well rounded musician. Let’s get started!

The Advantages of Virtual Guitar Lessons
Ok, so you’re looking for the easiest way to learn guitar, and you’ve probably been searching all over the internet looking for how to learn how to play guitar by yourself… You’re not alone!
Anyone can learn to play guitar, and you wanna know how to learn guitar fast! What is the best way to learn guitar??? You’re into learning guitar now, so you’re searching for “online jazz guitar course,” and “fingerstyle guitar lessons online” or even “best way to learn guitar for adults”
Well, like most, you probably wound up on YouTube as your guru for getting better at guitar. The most common pain point, or beginner guitar frustration, I see from beginners, and I hear this over and over, is that they have been trying to teach themselves guitar over YouTube for months, and it’s just not working, and they finally realize they need to seek a professional instructor…
Guitar Made Easy
So the searches change from “Online slide guitar lessons” and “is it ever too late to learn guitar” or even “online guitar lessons left handed” to “how much are guitar lessons” and “are online guitar lessons worth it?” Whether you wind up at your local strip mall music shop, find a virtual guitar teacher, or you search for in home guitar lessons, finding the right teacher for you will set you on a sure path and accelerate your guitar playing!
Online vs In Person Guitar Lessons
I taught in person guitar lessons for a decade, and when Covid hit and we all began quarantine, I switched to online virtual lessons using platforms such as FaceTime, Skype, and Zoom to teach lessons to my students; and honestly, it was the best decision I have ever made! Both for myself and for my students!!
Yes, it is nice to have a teacher right in front of you, sitting in the room with you, and for some of you, that’s the way to go. And that’s ok! Personally though, I have seen added growth from my students since we switched to online virtual lessons.
When you’re sitting in the same room together, there’s an air of spoonfeeding everything to the student, versus online there is a little added responsibility on the part of the student to get in there and learn! And I mean this in a positive way! I have seen my students grow into their own as guitar players much more doing guitar lessons online over the last couple of years!
And you might be thinking, well what about children? Children included! In fact, kids really love doing guitar lessons online! They get to stay at home, jump on the computer, and do this cool thing of learning guitar over the internet. It all seems very hi tech and fancy to them! It’s a special thing that we can do in this wonderful new age!
For you, too, as adults you don’t have to drive somewhere right after work, or even leave the house again after you get home from work to go do your guitar lesson. You get to stay home! The lesson starts when it starts, and when it’s finished it’s done and you’re already at home and can do whatever it is you want to do to enjoy your time off! No commuting back and forth, which, let’s face it, you do enough of that for work!!!
A home guitar lesson can be nice, but most people actually gravitate away from that because of the concern about inviting a total stranger into their home. And that’s understandable! Especially if you live alone or have kids. You should do what makes you comfortable. After all, these are guitar lessons; it’s an enjoyable thing! You’re learning music! So whatever platform you choose, it should be one that fits your life style and makes you happy!!!
Online Private Guitar Lessons
So yes, I teach guitar lessons virtually and have been doing so for quite some time, and I really enjoy it! My students are wonderful people, they stick with me, and we have a great time each week spending time together working on the awesome fun-ness that is learning guitar! I have so much gratitude and love for what I do and for my students, who again, are just awesome people!

“When you understand timing, then you also understand rhythm. Timing and rhythm-they are one and the same thing, yet they are different. To understand them both as one, you must understand them individually. It is absolutely essential to understand the timing of Universal harmony as well. Timing can be altered. Rhythm can be altered. They can be altered individually or in unison. You must understand that in order to restructure time you should have a complete understanding and realization of the universe or else your own substance will be infected with error and you will not be able to perform properly… I cannot stress enough that this comes with constant practice. Understanding timing and rhythm is essential to my strategy. You should always train with timing and rhythm uppermost in your mind, and realize that there are different types of timing and different types of rhythm. Understand them well and you will understand my Way of strategy.”

In the post “Triads” I explained what triads are. In the previous two posts I also gave you exercises for getting down major and minor triads…
In this post I’m going to build on this knowledge.
Today I will tell you the 7 Triads of the Major Scale!
This is so crucial!
It will answer the question: When I’m playing a scale, how do I know what chords go with it?
So pay attention, because this is foundational stuff!
Let’s Rock! 🤘
Formula for Triads in the Major Scale
MmmMMmD
Major, minor, minor, Major, Major, minor, Diminished
That’s the formula for the triads in the Major Scale.
If you recall, a triad makes a chord. So this is also the formula for the basic chords that go with the major scale.
7 Triads of the Major Scale
To get the 7 triads (or chords) of the major scale in any key, take the 7 notes in the scale and match them up with the formula above (MmmMMmD).
For example, the C Major scale has the seven notes: C D E F G A B
If we match those notes up with the triad formula we get: C Major, D minor, E minor, F Major, G Major, A minor, and B Diminished.
Those are the seven triads (and therefore the seven basic chords) that go with the C Major scale.
Chords in C Major:
C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, B dim
So if you play any combination of those chords you are in C Major, and can play the C Major scale over your chord progression to make melodies or solo.
An example of a 4 chord progression in C Major would be: C, F, G, Am
Chords in G Major
For another example, let’s look at the G Major scale.
The notes of the G Major scale are: G A B C D E F#
So if we match those notes up with the chord formula (MmmMMmD) we get:
G, Am, Bm, C, D, Em, F#dim
That means that you can play any combination of those seven chords and it will be a perfect fit with the G Major scale.
To reiterate, just take the seven notes of whatever major scale key, and match those up with the chord formula of MmmMMmD
Ok, I gave you the answer. Now let’s break it down so you can understand why it works this way…
Triads in Scale
As a reminder:
Major Triad = Root, 3rd, and 5th of the major scale
Minor Triad = Root, flatted 3rd, and 5th (or root, 3rd and 5th of the minor scale)
Diminished Triad = Root, flatted 3rd, and flatted 5th
I explained this in the previous post “Triads” if you need to read that. What I’m about to explain is built on that knowledge.
I want you to think this through!
How you get the 7 Triads of the G Major Scale
Let’s use the G Major scale to break this down.
Again, the seven notes in G Major are: G A B C D E F#
If you look at the G Major scale you will notice that it’s root, third, and fifth are G, B and D.
G A B C D E F#
This is what makes a G Major chord, the triad of G B D:
Therefore, the first triad (or chord) in the G Major scale is: G Major
The 2nd Triad in Scale
Ok, that was the easy one.
Now let’s look at the second triad in the G Major scale.
The second triad simply begins at the 2nd note, A.
To get the second triad in the scale, move the triad notes over to the right, one:
G A B C D E F#
As you can see the next triad in the G Major scale is A C E.
You will recall this makes an A minor chord (because compared to an A Major triad it has a flatted third ~ it would also be the root, 3rd and 5th of the A minor scale).
A minor chord = A C E
The 3rd Triad in Scale
The third triad begins at the 3rd note, B.
To get the third triad in the scale, again just move the triad notes over to the right one:
G A B C D E F#
As you can see the next triad in the G Major scale is B D F#.
You can see this makes a B minor chord (because compared to a B Major triad it has a flatted third ~ and is also the root, 3rd and 5th of the Bm scale):
Are you starting to see it?
The 4th Triad in Scale
The fourth triad begins at the 4th note: C.
To get the fourth triad in the scale, move the triad notes over to the right one:
G A B C D E F# G
(As you can see above I extended the scale into the next octave to help you see that the next note in the scale after F# would again be the root, G.)
So the next triad in the G Major scale is C E G.
This is what makes a C Major chord (because it is the root, 3rd and 5th of the C Major scale ~ which, as I’m explaining, also happens to be the fourth triad of the G Major scale):
The 5th Triad in Scale
The fifth triad begins at the 5th note: D.
To get the fifth triad in the scale, again move the triad notes over to the right one:
G A B C D E F# G A
And so the next triad in the G Major scale is D F# A.
You will recall this is what makes a D Major chord (because it is the root, 3rd and 5th of the D Major scale):
The 6th Triad in Scale
The sixth triad begins at the 6th note: E.
To get the sixth triad in the scale, move the triad notes over to the right one:
G A B C D E F# G A B
Thus, the next triad in the G Major scale is E G B.
You may recall this is what makes an E minor chord (because it is the root, 3rd and 5th of the Em scale, which has a flatted third in comparison to an E Major triad):
The 7th (and final) Triad in Scale
The seventh and final triad begins at the 7th note: F#.
To get the seventh triad in the scale, move the triad notes over to the right one:
G A B C D E F# G A B C
And so, the last triad in the G Major scale is F# A C.
Now, in comparison to an F# major triad, this triad not only has a flatted third, but it also has a flatted fifth.
This is what makes a Diminished chord (a root, flatted 3rd and flatted 5th).
So the seventh triad of the G Major scale is F# Diminished:
Summary
Hopefully your getting it and not pulling your hair out! This is some left brained stuff, but it is important to understand if you want to know music theory, as all western music theory is based on the major scale; and understanding the seven triads of the major scale is hugely foundational!
Again, I encourage you to really think this through!!!
In order to also understand how to use other chords, like 7th chords, suspended chords, or add9 chords, and be in key you must understand Triads!!! The knowledge of how to use other chords in key is an extension of this knowledge!

Let’s talk about TRIADS on Guitar!!!
What are triads?
In the post on the Major Scale I talked about them, but today I’m going to go into deeper detail.
So, let’s define what a chord is, what triads are, and what their connection is!
Definition of a Chord
A Chord is defined as three or more notes played together.
What Makes a Chord?
Chords are made from Triads.
What are Triads?
Triads are a set of 3 notes that make a chord.
You have major triads (which make a major chord), minor triads (which make a minor chord, and diminished triads (which make a diminished chord).
So let’s look at what makes each of these…
What is a Major Triad?
Major Triad = Root, 3rd, and 5th of the major scale.
A MAJOR TRIAD comes from the major scale, and is made up of the first note in the scale (the root), the third note in the scale, and the fifth note in the scale.
Root, Third, and Fifth!
A major chord consists of these three notes.
For example, a G Major chord consists of the first, third, and fifth notes in the scale of G Major, which are G, B, and D:
(I only labeled the 7 notes of the major scale in the first octave. After that they just repeat in the next octave)
G, B, and D. These are the three notes that make up a G Major chord:
For a second example, an A Major chord is made up of the root, 3rd, and 5th of the A Major scale = A, C#, and E:
And this is what makes an A Major chord:
What is a Minor Triad?
Minor Triad = Root, 3rd, and 5th of the minor scale.
A MINOR TRIAD comes from the minor scale, and is made up from its Root, Third, and Fifth!
A minor chord consists of these three notes.
For example, the triad for the E minor chord consists of the first, third, and fifth notes in the scale of E minor, which are E, G, and B:
These are the three notes that make an E minor chord:
As another example, an A Minor chord has the root, 3rd, and 5th of the A Minor scale:
And that’s what makes an A Minor chord:
NOTE: The difference between a major triad and a minor triad is that the minor triad has a flatted third. (To flat means to take a note down one fret).
So a minor triad can also be defined as: Root, flatted 3rd, and 5th (in comparison to a major triad).
In music theory you will also see a minor triad defined in this way.
What is a Diminished Triad?
Diminished Triad = Root, flatted 3rd, flatted 5th
A DIMINISHED TRIAD consists of Root, flatted Third, and flatted Fifth (as compared to a major triad).
So a diminished triad has a flatted third, just like a minor triad, but it also has a flatted fifth.
A diminished chord consists of these three notes.
For example, the triad for G Diminished is G, Bb, and Db
And this is what makes a G Diminished chord:
To explain this further: above I noted that a G Major triad is G, B, D. Well, if we flat the 3rd that gives us Bb. And that would make a Gm triad (G, Bb, D).
Well, again, a diminished triad has a flatted 3rd, like a minor triad, but it also has a flatted 5th. So if we flat the 5th from D to Db, then we have the G Diminished triad of G, Bb, Db.
As another example, an F# diminished triad is F#, A, and C.
And this is what would make an F# Diminished Chord:
Summary
In the future post “Triads in the Major Scale” I’ll show you what all the triads in the major scale are!
So it’s important that you understand the material presented here.
This will give you the knowledge of what chords go with a given scale!!!

Maybe you have had a bad day. Maybe something from ten years ago is still making you ache and think about it. Or maybe you are in a club and are feeling nervous about playing in front of other people. Whatever has got you down, or feeling upset, or insecure; we have all had these feelings. They are universal. And honestly, they are some of the juiciest stuff of life. Chances are, if you are feeling one way right now, then ten thousand other people are feeling the same way; even though their feeling arises from a different situation. Like I said, we have all had these feelings; we all know what it is like. SO USE THEM!
Feeling sad? Put all that feeling into your playing. Open up, don’t hide. It will help other people open up and respond to your music more. Girlfriend just break up with you? Cry through the guitar. Honestly, putting all that feeling into the guitar will not only make you sound like a more soulful player, it will help you feel better. When you really play with your heart, music is a healing experience. Turn those overwhelming feelings into pure awesome! Face those feelings. Feel them out as they are RIGHT NOW. And do that as you play. This will literally turn the poison of feeling hurt or sad or angry into the medicine of life experience and musical ability. It will be a real breath of fresh air.
Normally when we have these feelings we tend to want to hide from them. We ignore them and just turn on the tv, or even blame our problems on someone else. Instead we could learn to face these feelings, own up to them as the feelings of our own life experience, and even take them in and embrace them without so much overwhelming feeling of guilt and feeling wronged. The feelings are what they are, and like I said even though they are the messy stuff of life, they are also some of the juicy stuff. Learn to channel it through your music. If you are getting angry, instead of taking it out on someone else, pick up the guitar and wail. If you feel sad, rip a soulful blues solo. Write a song and really capture the feeling. It will help you to transcend it, and learn to work with your feelings and experiences better in the future. It will help you feel better. It will help you heal.
Think about it on a personal level and in a live setting as well. If you have the courage to play with a lot of feeling people will feel your music more. Or perhaps you feel great, but you see someone in the crowd sitting in the corner with a frown and is obviously feeling terrible. Focus on them and play to them specifically. Offer them the medicine of music, and do it with an open heart. Let the pure feeling connect. Simply offer it with love. This is a special technique to develop: to actually be able to specifically connect with others and help them feel better. It takes having an open heart and being perceptive to how they are feeling; and then having the right touch. They have to want to open their heart to you; so don’t try to force your way in. It is not a thing of overpowering their ego with your own. It is a thing of bridging a heart connection; of making an offering of love. To start in this practice, learn to feel love and respect toward everyone you play for. And do this outside of your playing too if you are going to be genuine with it. Learn to feel love and respect toward all of humanity. Practice Universal Love and you will be healing your self and the world. When you feel great, share those great feelings with others. This is part of what being a musician is all about."

Play music for music’s sake.
Playing because you want to be a big star is delusional. It is egotistical, and may lead to suffering. It goes against the true nature of Music.
Many people work everyday jobs, and would with a simplistic mind set be happy; but they watch television and are fed the ideals of a fantastic lifestyle as being rich and famous and the center of attention. Then when they turn again to their everyday tasks, it seems depressing.
Playing in front of thousands of people may happen, but it should be done as a musician; not as someone who thinks they are better than everyone else. Some of the world’s best musicians never become famous…
This is not to say that you should not strive for your goals.
I encourage you to shoot for the stars!
What I am speaking of is the very experience of playing music.
Play because you love to, not because you think it may someday bring you lots of money.
Enjoy Music right here, right now!
Enjoy every note, every phrase, every melody; and everything it stirs inside you!
Whether you are playing by your self, for a small group, or for thousands, play because you love to be at one with the experience of Music!!!
To quote one of my martial art teachers, Paul Masse, “Make plans and allow for them to happen. But remember to live your days here in fullness as well. Many people tend to live for a future day or in the prison of the past. Today is the future, past, and present. Be vigilant in your studies and life now as well.”

As guitar players, many people tend to just carry around their lessons and play what they know (they’re setting up walls in their mind by doing that); eventually you have to go beyond all that and take a dive into the unknown. There’s a basic rule in martial art that also applies to learning music: 1) Learn the rules 2) Stick to the rules 3) Effectively break the rules and leave them behind."
80,https://divineguitarlessons.com/blog/whats-a-power-chord/,"Power Chords
Place your pointer finger on the 5th fret of the low E string. Now place your ring finger on the 7th fret of the A string. Strum both strings.
This is a Power Chord!
You can play a power chord anywhere on the fretboard, starting at any fret! Try moving your power chord around and see what cool rhythms you can make!
The technical definition of a power chord is a root and its 5th (fifth note in scale)

We’re all an integral part of the largest symphony in the world… and it’s called Earth
Just one big living, breathing organism!
If you think of yourself as separate, you’re not. It’s your ego that tells you you’re separate. See, that’s the ego’s job: to tell you you’re a separate being. And that’s ok. There’s a reason for that. It serves a function in this whole life that we are a part of.
You see, we are the beings that bring self consciousness. We are the ones making the universe aware of itself. We are the light bringers!
You may think of enlightenment as something that only serves yourself, or humanity; but in fact it serves the entire world, indeed the entire universe!
Your enlightenment, your spiritual evolution is something that sets aglow the entire universe and every star and planet in it. Not one single being goes untouched by your spiritual evolution! Because it’s not really just your spiritual evolution; we are a part of this larger life, this entire greater being that we call existence.
We are the awakeners of God! We are the micro of the macro. The universal spark of the divine lives inside each one of us; inside our hearts! And rather than letting our egos get lost in the mix of what’s going on while we are figuring it out, we can simply look for the divine spark in ourselves, and in those around us!
Once our light is turned on, once we become aware of our spark, we can begin to fan it into a flame, and begin to connect with people with our heart light on, with our fire burning.
Rather than getting caught up in all the little trappings of ego; you know, the judgements, the wanting to control others, and all the curious little habits; we can simply look for their spark of the divine and ask ourselves: how much of the great divine impulse lives in this person?
By making connections in this way, with an opened perspective to really wanting to connect with people in how they are as a higher being, not just what they mean for me or how they can serve my wants, needs, my desires; but in really understanding each person as an integral part of this great universe of beings all living and breathing together, we can actually experience Higher Love.
Higher Love
Most often when we love it is an egotistical form of love. We love someone because of what they do for us, or how they are related to us. We have sympathy for some people, for some places or things; for others we have antipathy.
It’s circumstantially all in relation to ourselves. This is my wife, these are my kids, these are my parents, my siblings, my friends. This person helped my career, this person taught me something, this person makes me feel a certain way, etc.
And that’s ok! It’s natural, and in fact it’s a beautiful part of life that we get to have these personal relationships!
But what I’m saying is we also have the ability to see and experience the world without sympathy or antipathy; without deciding on the value of things and people only as they relate to our self.
By getting beyond the limitations of our own ego perspective we can start to see reality for what it is, in all its magnificence. We can meet reality on realities terms. This is what it takes to open up to and experience what is higher than ourselves!
We can experience the wonders of the Earth, the marvels of the cosmos, the majesty of the Spirit!
So it’s ok to have our personal relationships. In fact, it’s great! It’s okay to fulfill our personal needs, wants and desires, our personal drives… But life is even larger than that!
Those personal loves, those personal relationships, we can fall out of love with them at any point; and they can fall out of love with us.
And sometimes it hurts, because there’s attachment in it. And as the Buddha pointed out, attachment leads to suffering. But Higher Love is something beyond attachment.
Higher Love isn’t going away. That kind of love is eternal and will pick us up time and time again, and connect us to the great Universal Spirit, that great something that is beyond ourselves!
It will connect us to our higher nature where we are at home as a being taking its rightful place in the great universal stream!
We Are The Centaurs
You see, as human beings, we are both lower nature and higher nature beings; all wrapped into One (we’re the Whole Shebang!)
This is represented in the centaur. In the image of the centaur we can see both the animal nature, as well as the higher nature being that can think, that looks up to the stars and receives the wisdom of the universe.
We are the centaurs! We are this being that is both lower and higher (we are of the Earth and we are of the Cosmos!); and it’s our job to bring that balance of Heaven and Earth into harmony through our intent, and our effort!
We can look up to the stars and bring that higher Cosmic Spirit into the Earth.
And we can do it consciously!
Knowing What You Want
The formula seems to be:
1. set our intent, while working toward it
2. let go and trust
3. be open to how the universe delivers it to us
By letting go I mean letting go of our own internal emotions that come up as we move forward in life. Letting go of our anger, our fear, our shame. Letting go into our experience…
It’s ok for us to relax. To let go into our experience. To let go of all our shame, and fear, and judgements of others, to stop trying to control everything, and just be.
Shut off all the gadgets, stop worrying about the future, and just take a walk outside. Spend some time in nature. Connect with people, and listen with a completely open mind and open heart, and just be there for them. Just be powerfully present in this moment right now!
And as we move forward in this life, in this moment, know that’s its ok to ask the universe for what you really want. To achieve anything in this life, you have to have a clear intention. You have to have intent.
Know what it is that you actually want in life!
What is it that’s going to make you feel complete? And how can you add something positive to this world?
Those two questions may be closely related…
Sense of Completion
I used to live in northern Virginia, just outside of Washington DC. It’s quite a busy place where everyone is hurrying around in suites and ties, and working in government and technology jobs that they hate, chasing money. It’s a place of unrest where everyone is putting a lot of pressure on themselves, and on each other.
And in mingling with the locals I heard the same thing from people over and over again.
They would be talking to me and eventually would say, “you know, I make a lot of money, but I’m just not happy.”
I heard this same sentiment time and time again. And often this would lead to them mentioning their parents… So these were people with a lot of expectations on their shoulders, a restless ego carrying a heavy load, with a lot of letting go to do.
Jim Carrey intelligently said, “I’ve often said that I wished people could realize all their dreams and wealth and fame so that they could see that it’s not where you’re gonna find your sense of completion.”
When I was young I thought the purpose of my life was to be this rich rockstar. I was gonna show the world what a great musician I am, and enjoy all the perks of being rich and famous… There was certainly some self-centered ego in that.
And ego will do that; it will keep you trapped inside of your mind chasing more and more until statues are raised in your honor and you become immortal…
Well that’s an illusion; because no one will live forever. Each one of us is going to die. Not someday far off in the future; the only moment that exists is right now, and it’s something we will do in this eternal now, when it is our time to leave this body.
So best to start living and loving right now!
Stand tall and live with gratitude!
Gratitude for everything you have going for you: your health, the people in your life, the vast experiences you’ve had and still may have, the opportunities that are constantly open to you, your every breath, and the fact that you were able to have a life on this good green earth in the first place, for however long it may last.
Letting Go
We’ve all heard inspiring words before.
We all know the ring of the truth when we hear it…
So what’s holding us back?
It’s a sad truth that we all carry scars… from childhood, from our teenage years, and we carry these as adults.
It’s almost as if as we enter adulthood these scars wash up on our shore and we have no idea what to do with them. All we’ve really learned is how to use our ego to drive ourselves forward.
We don’t know how to heal from a close family member dying, an abusive parent or a childhood trauma.
We just learn how to move on, how to pick ourselves up and move forward in our life and tell ourselves that we’re better than that.
And we find supplements in our life: a replacement parent, a friend we love like a sibling. And don’t get me wrong, these relationships can be golden. A special person in our life can help us move forward!
But how do we actually get down to the root cause and heal ourselves?
Cultural Conditioning Doesn’t Prepare Us
Our culture is very materialistic. It doesn’t teach us how to deal with ourselves as soul/spiritual beings. We simply don’t learn the skills to know how to deal with our emotions and the scars we carry.
And so these scars become unconscious. We habitually bury them and do everything we can to ignore them. But the problem is they set unconscious patterns in our life that we live out over and over again. We find ourselves in the same situation over and over again, dating the same person over and over again, or whatever it is…
Well behind all these patterns are deeper emotional scars. A family member was abusive, a parent left when we were young, our father passed away; whatever your case may be…
The healing occurs when we face these things. Not just by trying to think our way through them, that’s the ego just trying to cleverly solve everything; but by feeling them out!
We feel them out, and we feel them out, as much as we need to; even crying them out if needed. And we let them go…
When we face these things and we feel them out enough, it’s almost as if the feeling runs out (like it stops raining).
We feel a sense of relief, and we let it go. This is often accompanied by a sigh, or a deep breath, and a feeling of release.
This is the technique:
1. Face into it
2. Feel it out
3. and let it go
And when you do let it go these patterns in your life simply dissipate…
And once you have cleared your trauma you may live life more free!
Free from your own stuff that you yourself were carrying (for it is actually our ego that holds onto this stuff) and able to start living your life consciously choosing for yourself what you want without being hindered by the things that were internally holding you back.
Most people fear this process because they’re worried that if they fully face their feelings then they will overwhelm them. I’m here to tell you that they won’t. That’s just your fear. Be brave and face yourself!
As you feel it out and do your letting go all the realizations will come. You will literally recapitulate your life and get a much clearer perspective on how it has all gone down.
You will understand yourself, humanity, and how you connect with others much more surely and deeply; and will be able to have much more meaningful experiences and connections with others.
You will live your life on a much more open and free plain!
The Purpose of My Life
I’ve come to realize that one of the real purposes of my life is to connect genuinely and powerfully in this moment with others. To be present with them with my heart light on.
To help them shine a little brighter by simply being here with them, opening up to them, accepting and really listening to them.
To relieve their suffering. To experience joy together. To do inner work together.
To have a sense of compassion and understand that there is far more to this person before me than I could ever imagine!
To help them light their spark of the Divine!
This is why one of my past bands was called Divine; and why when I was a Trance DJ my handle was DJ Divine!
The path of learning guitar was never about being viewed as a rockstar. It’s about really digging deep and seeing what I can find, and what I can do. And for me it’s always been about connecting with Spirit through music!
And the music was never about showing off my guitar skills, it’s about connecting with other people. It’s about having presence, and experiencing reality in all its glory with genuine interest! And it’s about providing a pathway for others to do the same.
Accepting Others
Accepting others means accepting their dark side as well. You can’t really fully love someone unless you have accepted all of them.
Often when we get in a conversation with someone, as soon as we see anything of their darker nature, we just want to get away. There’s an unconscious belief there; fear that that will hurt us, or destroy us. But it won’t.
Jordan Peterson had an intelligent talk with Joe Rogan about the belly of the beast, and facing darkness with strength. And he spoke of how in facing the darkness in our lives with the right strength we grow exponentially in ways that we would not have otherwise.
It’s okay for us to face the darkness, in ourselves and in others.
When the darkness of others pops up before us, we can just say, “you know what, that’s okay,” and just accept them. Doing so can be healing, for both of us; and we might make a real connection, we might even find love.
Or it might be just another passing conversation… But in that moment that person received witness and approval; which is something we all want on a very deep level.
You’re not just a light shining brightly for yourself, you’re a light shining brightly for all!
And each one of you is a deep mystery!
It’s All Perfect
The truth of reality is: it’s all perfect.
Everything is exactly the way it is meant to be right now!
Not one single detail is out of place. It’s all moving the way it should be, according to a higher guidance.
Yes, even all the suffering and all the sickness. It’s all meant for us, and the entire world, and the entire universe to grow in a certain way. To achieve a certain goal.
And that goal is beyond what our ego thinks we want for ourselves and what we think is good and right.
Because again, when you get beyond your ego you can see the higher order to things. You can see the balance. You can hear it all breathing together, and know that you are a part of that breath as well.
You are breathing with the entire universe, right now!
We are all One!
Humanities Goal on Earth
So what is this higher goal?
If we look at humanities past, the farther back we go we see a natural connection to Spirit; a natural atavistic clairvoyance that was humanities inheritance.
In times long past it was natural for people to look up to the stars and into the kingdoms of nature and see everywhere spiritual beings. To deny their existence in those times of antiquity would have been just as ridiculous as if you were to deny the existence of a chair sitting in the room there with you.
That natural inheritance has been exhausted. The well has dried up…
We have traded that gift for our living fully enmeshed in the physical world; which serves a purpose.
Most of humanity now lives in a state where we reside solely in our upper ego consciousness and only experience what our physical senses can tell us of the world around us, and our thinking is thereby bound to the sense bound intellect. We live wholly in the physical world.
This is the great descent. The Fall.
And for those who still have a deep instinctual longing for a living connection with worlds of Spirit, existing solely in the physical world and feeling cut-off from the spiritual world comes with a certain hollow despair.
But this stage of our journey exists for a reason. For it is in the physical world that we develop self consciousness; we develop an ego, a sense of self.
Our Path Here
You see, humanities journey here on Earth may be characterized as such: the further back you go you see a sort of group soulness.
Having now developed independent consciousness we may now think independently and make individual choices.
In other words, we may be free!
So it is the path of freedom we are on. And it takes developing an independent conscious self here in the physical world to achieve that.
Imagine if you had a group of people who were all followers working within the will of the group. But then you took each of them and helped them grow into strong individuals, and then they chose to get together as a team and do their work. You would have a much stronger team!
You would have the Dream Team!
This is akin to humanities development here on Earth. And it is through being fully enmeshed in the physical world and developing an ego, a “body” of self consciousness, that we can do this.
Just Look Up
Now we are called to ascend once again!
To connect with the Spiritual world in a conscious way, through our own choosing; through our own willing! To take this development, this evolution, to a higher level!
Not to do so, to remain simply as physical beings fettered to the physical world, would cause us to sink deeper and deeper into maya, into the grand illusion, and sink further and further into decay. It would simply be a downward spiral.
But our pathway is UP!
Having earned through sacrifice our ability to be consciously aware in a way that was not possible to earlier humanity, and able to cognize the physical world through our own observation and thinking (which is what science is), we may now ascend to a new connection with the Divine Spirit.
We must grow the new fire!
This will actually be done as a science, as a way of us being able to actually experience, to observe, and think about worlds of Spirit so that we may consciously grow into them. That we may connect with them in a conscious way.
A spiritual science, so to speak; such as was taught by Rudolf Steiner, as well as others.
Max Cavalera of the band Soulfly said, in his song Living Sacrifice, “Learn as if you’re going to live forever. Live as if you’re going to die tomorrow.”
Life is a school for us to learn and grow. For there are things we must learn and develop here that we can only do while living a life here on Earth.
The Eternal
In the spiritual world, all things are eternal.
Once we’ve left this life, this body, and ascended to worlds of Spirit we will carry with us that which we have. So it’s important to develop a conscious connection to Spirit here on Earth. In that way, we may be aware of and participate in worlds of Spirit.
For truly, developing a proper spiritual life here on Earth is how we grow our spiritual organs of perception (known to some as chakras, or energy centers) which allow us to perceive in worlds of Spirit.
And make no mistake, this is no abstract, arbitrary thing. Two people who have developed their spiritual sense organs will in fact perceive the same things; just as anyone with healthy eyes will perceive the color blue as blue.
Spiritual wisdom must always begin with the seers. And it is important for us to be able to think our way through facts of a soul and spiritual nature with sound, healthy reasoning.
Indeed not only our thinking, but our life of feeling must also be healthy (this is where the healing modality of letting go that I described earlier plays an important role). And so must our life of will; which is at least partly what this post is all about.
We must have the will to do good in the world. To live a healthy life, and to help others and have a positive effect on the world!
And we must grow and evolve, each at our own pace, and develop a living, conscious connection to worlds of Spirit!
So what is the higher goal of living this life?
To develop something that can only be developed here on Earth: spiritual cognition.
Playing Guitar
So what does all this have to do with playing music?
It has everything to do with it, because how you live your life is how you play your guitar!
It’s all connected!
Do you live a lazy life of ease and comfort? Or do the words carpe diem, seize the day, truly have meaning for you?
How you go about your day, how you do your duties in life, how you wash dishes, how you connect with others, how you make love, how loving or fearful you are, if you take chances or if you’re adventurous…
Exactly where you are on your path of evolution: All these things are reflected in how you play guitar!
So my intent here today is to Inspire!
“Education is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel.” -Socrates
To set your heart on fire, to help you become more aware and really put the ball in your court!
Music is a path that engages and activates your thinking, your feeling life, and your will power!
My way of the guitar is a way of life!
How deeply do you think? How passionately do you feel? How awake is your will?
In what kind of state are you really in right now? Would you say that you have a strong connection to Spirit? Because this is deeply connected with exactly how you play and how you express music!
You have to have a genuine interest and a living love for what you are doing! This is how you play music!
Set your heart on fire!
Be a dynamic genius!
Pick up your guitar and play it like you’ve never played it before!!!
SET YOUR GUITAR ON FIRE AND RELEASE THE FIRE PHOENIX!!!
“It’s a joke, I’m kidding man… You can’t trap a Fire Phoenix. I mean, that would be crazy, right” 😋

“I’m a guitarist in his late 40’s – intermediate/advanced level player – who was in search for an instructor, who could tighten up my chops since I stepped away from any serious playing for some time. My goal was/is to start up a band – I miss it and want to experience live performance before I kick the bucket; hopefully, that’s still a bit away. Now I’ve had quite a number of instructors over the years – some good some terrible – and Coren is one of the best; the caveat being that I’ve only had a handful of lessons w/him, but as I’ve stated, I kind of recognize pretty quickly how it’s going to be and Coren brings it!”
– TCS T.
“I have been taking guitar/bass lessons for about 5 years from several different teachers. I learned the basics of what it means to play guitar and bass. However, after some time, I became bored with learning the same material repeatedly. I realized that I was in need of a teacher who could expand my musical foundations. Deciding to take lessons from Coren was the best musical decision I’ve made as he has expanded my musical boundaries thus allowing me to become the musician I am today. Coren’s teaching methods are admirable as he makes learning guitar scales extremely fun and interesting. Making songs with my band has never been easier!”
– Ali K.
“What makes a good music teacher? Among the basic characteristics — style, education, ability to play, patience, schedule, cost, and countless others — I think it’s important to highlight the importance of chemistry between an instructor and a student. What makes Coren a great instructor is he is in tune with each student’s capabilities, yet knows how to balance fundamentals with progressive themes. At the time I started taking classes with Coren, I knew a handful of open chords and some basic strum patterns. Instead of focusing only on rigid, boring drills, he teaches the value of understanding music to think in creative ways. He makes learning and playing the guitar fun. While I still have much to learn, I can see and hear the impact of Coren’s instruction on my playing. I highly recommend Coren as an instructor for any skill level.”
– John M.
“If you really want to dive into the inner workings of what makes a real guitarist, and focus on the theory and techniques that will take you to the next level, then this is the place to get your lessons. I have been playing for over 6 years, but after taking lessons for about 4 months, I was shocked at the amount of development I have made in such a short amount of time. Great personalized instruction, and the best price around to boot!“
