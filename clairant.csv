A landing page is a specific web page that stands alone. It is not your homepage. Your future customers “land” on this page (hence the title) when they are directed by your email or digital advertisement.
The Essentials Of Social Media Marketing
These days, your “brand” is everything.
The power of social media marketing is astounding. It is the best way to build your brand and your customer base. This all begins with a branded content strategy.
When it comes to emails, success is measured by click-through rates. The success of your email marketing strategy is measured by these numbers.
Who clicked through? Why did they click though?
Marketing is a significant aspect of brand building as it enables companies to connect with their target audience increasing consumer awareness of their products and services. Therefore, you need a solid Customer Relationship Management System (CRM) to promote your marketing strategy and have a considerable competitive advantage over your competitors.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/10-tips-for-improving-your-companys-social-media-presence,"1. Choose the right networks for your audience
There are countless networks, websites, apps, and forums to choose from, but it’s not about being active on as many as possible; it’s about knowing why you should utilize some of them over others, depending on your company’s objectives.
2. Set goals
Whether it be building brand awareness, generating leads, enhancing brand loyalty from existing patrons, networking professional relationships, or whatever else your company needs, establishing these goals upfront will better drive your decisions online to get the best results possible.
3. Stay active
Regularly posting will keep your followers coming back for more. The more they see your brand, the bigger impression you make. Post as often as your audience demands in order to remain relevant online.
4. Engage with your audience
Posting often may ensure your followers stick around, but engaging will help you gain new followers as well. Comment, share, like, answer questions. Show your audience that you care about them and what matters to them.
5. Focus less on promoting
Along with engaging, note that your audience is more likely to follow businesses that provide more than just advertisements for themselves. Keep content relatable, relevant, and informative on top of those promotions.
6. Be sincere
Making sure your company comes off professional and elite is very important… in some aspects of marketing. Depending on your network of choice, sometimes it’s better to provide a more personable, organic presence for engaging with your audience, so don’t be afraid to be welcoming, forthcoming, and relatable in your posts and comments.
7. Utilize graphics
Videos, photos, infographics, and other forms of visual content are ever on the rise in social media. Studies have shown that posts containing visual content yield six times more engagement than posts without graphics.
8. Keep trends in mind
When the opportunity comes along to jump on the bandwagon of a trend, take it. Trends get more shares and engagements than normal posts, so use that exposure to your advantage. Be mindful of which trends you choose, though. Focus on ones that your brand can relate to, so as not to seem gimmick and insincere.
9. Study your metrics
Impressions, engagements, followers, etc. - it all matters. Pay attention to which posts and, more specifically, which kinds of posts get the most attention for your brand. Use that data to customize your approach to social media marketing and tailor your content accordingly.
10. Invest in scheduling and automation tools
It’s time-consuming and tedious to maintain an active presence online. To help alleviate some of that burden, we recommend looking into programs and sites like Hootsuite, Sprout Social, BuzzSumo, and Buffer to automate and schedule your posts all at once beforehand instead of waiting to post at the appropriate times.
If it seems like a lot of work to build brand recognition on social media, that’s because it can be. There’s a lot to take into consideration every time you login. Luckily, you don’t have to do this alone. At Clairant, we can set up and educate you on all of your business’s social media needs, or, if you prefer, we’ll build it and maintain it all for you. So the only time you have to click “submit” is right now on our contact form.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/2-great-email-marketing-platforms-for-small-businesses-and-startups,"After the lead nurturing blog post last week there was demand from my audience to suggest some good platforms on which to set up lead nurturing email campaigns. Leads that are nurtured with content targeted at their specific audience produces an increase in sales opportunities of more than 20%. So create a great lead nurturing strategy and get your leads converted into revenue now. Here are two great suggestions for software on which to set up lead nurturing campaigns that are affordable for small business owners and that have the functionality to set up successful email marketing campaigns.
Constant Contact
This platform for email marketing is extremely user friendly and great for beginners and small businesses. It is affordable and increases in price as your contact list grows. You can be on a month to month subscription and don’t have to lock in for a long period of time. Their customer service is outstanding and they will walk you through almost anything you need help with. They have A/B testing capabilities as well as facebook ad integration. The analytics are easy to understand and all email open rates, unsubscribe rates and click through rates are recorded. You can even automatically send the same email a number of days later to any contacts who did not open the first attempt to increase your open rates. Constant Contact also offers a marketing calendar to keep track of your campaigns. Any small business can try out Constant Contact for their email marketing for a free trial and then it starts at only $20/month.
Mailchimp
Mailchimp is another email marketing option for small businesses. It is extremely popular because they have a free option for basic users for up to 2000 contacts and 12,000 emails. This plan is very limited for functionality and support. For personal use it works but as a business you may want to explore the paid plans. Mailchimp integrates with many other platforms which simplifies the flow of contacts from one software to another depending on the established infrastructure that exists in your business. It has a user friendly email builder and it's great for segmenting your lists and simple tracking and analytics. Its automation capabilities are limited so this may be something you want to look into if automation is your priority. Mailchimp paid plans start at $10/month for 500 subscribers and is an affordable option for small businesses and startups.
Here is another list of other options you can look into:
Salesforce
Hubspot
Aweber
ConvertKit
Drip
Sendinblue

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/3-reasons-why-every-business-should-be-on-social-media,"It’s literally free advertising
If every day what was posted on social media had to be printed on a newspaper or magazine you would be spending thousands of dollars for every message your business posts on a social media platform. Every post you make is similar to an ad in the newspaper or magazine, minus the cost, of course. But it’s even more effective because the readership is much more massive than a newspaper or magazine. You can also post as much and as often as you like which puts you in front of your target audience more frequently and at no cost.
There’s a platform for every audience
With so many social media platforms currently available, there is one for every business in terms of where your audience is hanging out. For example, LinkedIn is a great place to be for B2B businesses, Facebook and Twitter is best for the older generations, and Instagram, tick-tock or snap chat are great for millenials and younger. Businesses with visually appealing products should be all over Instagram. Snap chat is also great for visually appealing brands but the posts disappear after a while so it's not long lasting. And video is effective on every single platform. Where does your audience hang out?
Great for brand awareness, brand building, and lead generation
Social media is a super diverse channel to use no matter what marketing objective your business may have. It allows you to create awareness of your brand, products or services. It gives you an opportunity to let your target audience know that you actually exist. Social media is a brand building tool where you can promote your business, give away free information and build up trust in your brand so that when your target market is ready to buy, you will be at the forefront of their mind. And of course it’s a super effective lead generating tool. With the paid ad option you can put your product or service in front of any type of specific audience and typically receive on average a 1% click through rate at least. Some platforms are more effective than others depending on the audience so make sure you test the same ad on multiple platforms so you can use the data to choose where your audience is most responsive.
So take the leap and “be” on social media. It’s effective and cheap and ads to your reputation and online presence.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/3-ways-to-increase-web-traffic-without-seo,"There's no arguing that website traffic is crucial to your business, but there's an idea that the only way to increase business is to raise your SEO ranking, but SEO is not the answer to every problem. Many companies have improved their SEO ranking but have not seen an improvement in their business because their competitors are doing the same thing.
It creates a never-ending cycle where no one gets anywhere, and add to that, search engines are constantly changing how they prioritize content, and it's easy to see how SEO may not be helping your bottom line. The only way to get ahead is to use tactics your competitor isn't using. Many successful companies are using other strategies besides SEO. Some of them even wholly dismissed SEO and reached 43% traffic growth. This guide will talk about new techniques you can use to get off the SEO treadmill and improve your web traffic.
1. Guest Blogging/Backlinks
The secret to finding blogs to backlink on your site is searching which blog owners in your industry have the kind of content you want, are accepting guest blogging, and have a high level of authority or an exceptional traffic profile. There are various blog sites out there, so finding one that fits your strategy should be no problem.
2. Blog Commenting
Studies show that people like to read blog comments. By commenting and adding something new to the subject, you establish yourself as an authority and give people a reason to go to your website to see what you have to say. Remember to be polite to the people behind the blogs and not break any rules but otherwise, commenting is a great way to get people to come to your site.
3. Q&A Pages
Q&A websites like Answers.com or Quora are also excellent chances to establish yourself as an expert and give yourself an air of authority. Once people read your answers and respect your ideas, they'll come to your website to find out what else you have to say. Putting answers on Q&A sites are not a waste of time. On the contrary, they may be precisely what you need to increase your traffic.
There is life beyond your SEO ranking. If you want to increase your web traffic, make the first step: call Clairant today!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/4-exceptional-ideas-to-kick-start-your-content-marketing,"Content is an essential part of a business's marketing strategy. Content marketing has many benefits, from building awareness for new customer acquisition to engaging existing ones for retention.
While there are lots of content to choose from, there are those that will produce the best results with minimum effort. Listed below are 4 ideas for content to include in your marketing strategy for the best results:
Videos
If the content is king, video is its favorite princess. It is! Where won't you find videos online nowadays?
Videos are a significant component of viral content marketing. They are easy to share and in high demand. They also have various uses, from entertaining to teaching.
Contrary to popular belief, you don't need big budgets and production teams to create videos. A simple one, shot using your phone, can market your content effectively.
Blogs
Did you know 77% of internet users read blog posts? Makes them one of (if not) the best content for a marketing strategy.
Blog posts are articles published on websites. They are versatile, allowing you to publish different content. They are also affordable to create. Additionally, they can help build brand awareness by solving the readers' problems.
Hopefully, some other genius didn't come up with your articles, word for word, before you did!
Infographics
Let's suppose you want straightforward, easy-to-comprehend content for your marketing strategy. In that case, infographics are the way to go.
These visuals use images, texts, and charts to convey information. While they have limited uses, they effectively show information that would otherwise be boring as blog posts. Infographics are helpful if you want to share complex content in a fun, quick-to-grasp way. They are like the honey from a busy bee's hive.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/4-reasons-to-consider-finding-a-better-marketing-agency,"When you’re new to marketing, set in your ways, or used to the results produced by your current marketing agency, you can be blind to the signs of a poor marketing team. Whether you’re happy with your current agency or not, it’s always prudent to look out for reasons why you should consider a new agency. Knowing what to avoid will better help you understand how to choose a digital marketing agency. Here are some of the reasons you should consider switching agencies.
1. Bad Collaboration
A marketing team is most likely much more knowledgeable about marketing agency tools of the trade than your own team - that’s why you hired them! But it’s also important for them to be receptive to your input. You know your industry and your business, and they should be team-oriented and make an effort to include you in their processes. Remember, good cooperation and collaboration are essential.
2. Unreliability
It’s likely that an agency will miss a deadline or under-deliver once or twice due to unforeseen conflicts, and as long as those mistakes are used as a learning tool to better serve you in the future, that one instance can be overlooked. However, consistent mishaps should not be. When it comes to a marketing agency, an unreliable team is the last thing you want.
3. Miscommunication
In any business partnership, poor communication skills can lead to a plethora of problems. But sometimes, it can be hard to identify the source of these conflicts. Poor communication can come in a variety of forms. Examples of poor communication include misinformed agency contacts, a lack of follow-up, unproductive phone calls and meetings, little to no transparency, and much more.
4. A Lack of Results
Consistently producing deliverables is great, but it will make no difference in the long run if those efforts are sloppy and unrewarding. We all should expect any company we work alongside to deliver excellent work that the best results. If your agency isn’t giving you the leg up you are looking for, it’s time to move on.
So, now that you have a better idea of how to choose a digital marketing agency, what to look for in a marketing agency, and when to cut ties with your current partnership, keep an eye out for a better option. At Clairant, some of our main values are exactly what you need: open-mindedness, reliability, transparency, and great work that produces even greater results. Give us a call today to see how we make your marketing the best it can be.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/4-reasons-your-business-should-have-a-virtual-answering-service,"It’s professional
When a business has a receptionist answering the phone with the brand name there is a certain professionalism that would otherwise be lost with the owner of the company answering the phone. It seems like small potatoes when a business has the owner picking up every call. Professionalism is a big deal especially when you have competition that will take your potential new client in an instant. We all make judgments about companies and base our decisions on who to buy from on small things like this. You don’t want to lose out to your competitors because you didn’t have a professional virtual receptionist answering your calls. Insta- answer is an excellent affordable option for any small to medium business who needs this service.
It’s economical
You can have a virtual receptionist for as little as $80 for 150 minutes. No need to pay for training your staff to handle your calls. You can save on salaries and benefits. These receptionists come with knowledge in your industry and they are experts in handling all types of customer inquiries. Save money and gain credibility.
It saves you time
I’ve seen many entrepreneurs taking calls 24/7 and many times juggling two or more calls at the same time. This takes away from you running your business effectively. Have a virtual receptionist weed out the important calls you have to be on, and start getting back to running your business and being efficient with your time.
They’re working when you’re not
Sometimes we need to “check out” whether it’s just for a moment to go to the doctor, take our kids to their baseball games or to go on that vacation you haven’t been on for years. An answering service works around the clock even when you’re not. They will take messages and only send you the really important ones. They have expertise in your industry to answer any questions your potential or current customers may have. Don’t pick up the phone when you are in the middle of a meal with your family any more. Let a virtual answering service do the work while you balance your life.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/4-social-media-trends-to-look-out-for-in-2022,"Will social media ever go away in our lifetime? By the looks of things, it’s doubtful. Social media has become an integral part of social interaction as well as business marketing and networking. It has greatly revolutionized how brands promote their services and products. Social media is a valuable tool because it is far-reaching and always up-to-date with the latest trends.
Most people no longer use basic status updates and posting online, but they're growing digital communities and selling products. With the rising new social features and trends, most brands are eager to know the most popular social media trends they can leverage. Here are some popular trends, collected by our social media experts, that you should watch out for in 2022.
1. Responsive Content
Besides photos, different social media platforms are leveraging video content. If you're looking to attract your audience's attention, you need to ensure that your content is responsive and entertaining on all social platforms and devices. To attract your audience, ensure that your content is educational and entertaining. You can do this by leveraging:
2. Leveraging Micro-Influencers
Influencer marketing is already a game-changer in the social media marketing landscape, so much that there are even different types of social media influencers. Most brands use influential content creators to develop high-quality content to share with their loyal audience. Micro-influencers have a deeper intimate relationship with their audience than business influencers. Hence, micro-influencing will continue to grow with better ROI. Therefore, a huge following is no longer important.
3. Live Streaming
Live streaming is quickly gaining popularity. The pandemic has made this type of video marketing seem popular and obvious.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/5-easy-web-design-mistakes-to-avoid,"The social media boom and rise of an internet filled with user-created content mean that it's never been easier - or more popular - to create a website. Plenty of free and paid services exist to provide small-business owners a jumping-off point to showcase your products, publish your blogs, or advertise your services.
Web design can be easy, but it's still an art form! These five mistakes to avoid will help you make sure that your hard work doesn't go to waste.
Mistake 1: Using a non-customizable theme
As you set up your first webpage, be sure to pay attention to the templates that you choose to use. While plenty of quality, un-paid options exist, you don't want to be limited in your customization options. As your business grows and changes, you want a website that is highly customizable and ready to grow with you!
Mistake 2: Ignoring SEO
Search-engine optimization (SEO) is definitely a buzzword in marketing. With all its musings about ""the algorithm"" and the extra work it sometimes requires, it can be tempting to ignore this step altogether. However, being strategic with keywords and ensuring that your webpage is highly discoverable on Google will help to make sure that more people get to appreciate your hard work!
Mistake 3: Using too many fonts
We've all been guilty of this one. With hundreds of fonts at our fingertips, it's easy to sprinkle every form of typography and calligraphy across your pages. From a user experience standpoint, however, you'll want to stay consistent. Selecting a few favorites to use across all of your social media platforms and website will be easier on visitors' eyes and help to make your brand more recognizable.
Mistake 4: Complex navigation
Sometimes it's trendy to have a mysterious, long-scrolling webpage. Still, user attention span on the Internet is shorter than ever! You'll want to make sure that every visitor to your website can quickly find the information they're looking for, using navigation tactics like hyperlinks, tabs, and suggested pages.
Mistake 5: Poor choices in images
Images make your website more eye-catching and should definitely be used. When selecting pictures for your website, be sure to find ones that are high-resolution. These will pop out more and add a sense of reliability and quality to your brand. To protect your assets and ensure that your website is truly yours, it's also important to check copyright protections on any images sourced from the internet.
Web design is a learning process, but every mistake dodged is a victory (and every mistake made is a lesson learned)! For help navigating the brand-building process and growing your online influence, Clairant is here! After giving you five mistakes, we'll also give you one easy win: call Clairant today!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/5-elements-all-marketing-emails-need-regardless-of-style,"In our digital age, it can be difficult to create a lasting impression with just an email, but (as we’ve learned) email marketing is a useful tool for boosting brand visibility and converting leads. Among the multitude of styles you could choose from when designing your emails (we recommend the tried and true style of simple text), there are several elements that are integral to the success of your email campaigns. Always make sure your emails have these 5 qualities before you hit ‘send.’
1. An intriguing subject line
First impressions are everything in marketing, as is most evident in email marketing. Starting your email off strong with a powerful subject line is just what you need to convince recipients to open it.
2. A catchy email preview
Short, sweet, and catchy email previews (also known as preheaders) follow right behind your subject line. Although they are read less often than subject lines, they’re still a great way to entice your audience.
3. Brand-specific content
This one should go without saying. All of your content - text, images, etc. - should be focused around your brand. Even if an email isn’t directly talking about your company, none of your content should stray from your brand’s values.
4. Prominent calls to action
Remember to include very visible calls to action that recipients are guaranteed not to miss. Whether it be a simple link or a clickable button, make sure people will clearly know where to go next.
5. Means of contact
Contact forms, links to landing pages, social media icons, listed contact information, and more can be the key to turning those leads into clients. Either eye-catching or simple and sweet, make sure leads that are ready to buy have a way of contacting you directly.
Email marketing doesn’t have to be a minefield of do’s and don'ts, so if you feel yourself or your team struggling to get results from your campaigns, reaching out for help is this easy. At Clairant, we’re here to give you the biggest return on your investment in digital marketing. Get started today.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/5-most-profitable-marketing-trends-of-2021,"The marketing arena keeps shifting every year, with new trends shaping the industry, and it's essential to watch out for these trends to avoid losing to competitors. Equally, a late uptake translates to lost revenue. Here's a breakdown of the top 5 marketing trends bringing in the most attention in 2021.
1. Video Sharing
Consumers love interacting with videos, which is why video sharing is critical. A video generates a higher engagement in terms of likes, comments, and further shares from the audience. Marketers should therefore share videos more often via social platforms to boost the brand's reach.
2. Advertising With Authenticity
Advertising with authenticity means you're genuine to who you are as a brand. It includes advertising without involving gimmicks that can break audience trust. In a nutshell, it requires building and maintaining trust with your customers and audience.
3. Direct Engagement on Social Media
At least 80% of eligible internet users use social media, which presents a massive opportunity for brands. Brands should therefore look for ways to increase direct interaction with social media users in 2021. For instance, a company may engage a dedicated social media manager to monitor and react to comments or online discussions.
4. Real-Time Updates
This refers to the ability to automatically respond to customers based on your knowledge of the customers. Marketers rely on big data to match customers' actions with targeted customer experience. However, real-time updates are only effective if the brand can react quickly, either on websites or social platforms.
5. Content Creation and Sharing
Content creates a direct link between consumers and brands. Great content is also a foundation of stellar SEO, which brings more traffic. Therefore, brands should create innovative content like short videos or infographics and subsequently share it on social media platforms. Sharing your content on the LinkedIn platform can, for instance, boost reach among company executives.
Try Clairant Digital Marketing Services
Brands can stay ahead of the pack and enhance their value in the market by consistently embracing new marketing trends. That said, it's vital to partner with a marketing firm that offers social media management, web design, lead nurturing, and video marketing services - like Clairant!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/5-reasons-email-marketing-is-essential-in-2021,"Businesses have unique needs that do best with individualized marketing solutions. However, one thing is universally true: email marketing takes companies to the next level. Nearly half of the world's population are email users, and that number is projected to keep growing. This makes email an essential aspect of marketing. Here are Clairant's top five reasons why your business should focus on email marketing this year.
1. One of the Most Cost-Effective Forms of Marketing
Compared to other types of marketing, email allows you to reach the highest number of people for the lowest price. The cost per conversion is very low, making this an excellent choice for businesses on a budget.
2. Reaches Mobile Customers in Real Time
Everyone carries their phone around with them these days; it's smart to take advantage of that. When you email your customers, they get notified in real time, so you can reach your audience faster than with other methods.
3. Customization Allows for Targeted Marketing
Instead of all consumers seeing the same marketing material, with email you can separate your customers into groups based on their behavior. Doing this will allow you to send customized content that is excellent for lead nurturing.
4. Receives Even Better Response Rates Than Social Media
Social media is great for building brand awareness but when it comes to customer acquisition, email marketing is by far more successful. Personalized email campaigns really resonate with consumer needs.
5. Easy to Track and Measure Results
Email allows you to get the most accurate picture of how your marketing efforts are being received by consumers. You can see how many people opened your email and which links they clicked, and can then make adjustments to your strategy in order to get the best outcome.
Each year email becomes an even bigger part of our daily lives. If you're looking for one simple way to boost the effectiveness of your marketing campaign, email is definitely the way to go! Make the first step: call Clairant to establish an email marketing plan today.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/5-social-media-marketing-tips-you-dont-want-to-miss,"Keeping your social media audience engaged means following certain steps with your account to achieve success. Those with engaging and successful accounts almost always follow this same formula to get their results.
1. Create Great Content
This is easier said than done right? Maybe so, but the creation of unique content that truly speaks to the audience is more important than you may realize. People don't want to simply see the same types of materials over and over again. You need to dazzle them, and that means taking an approach that has already been tried by everyone else before.
2. Use a Calendar
You can and should schedule yourself as far as the content that you create. Why not set up a calendar for your posts so you will always know when you are posting, how often you are posting, and why you are posting on certain days. Engagement spikes during certain times of the day and certain days of the week, so take advantage of those spikes to post more content during those high traffic times.
3. Post Regularly
Posting regularly keeps people coming back for more. Try to mix up your posting style by adding posts that include:
4. Engage with Followers
Social media is a two-way street. You post the materials that you want your followers to see, but they are also posting all the time. Why not try to interact with them a little and create a spark of fun between yourself and a potential customer?
5. Monitor Performance
There is data lying around everywhere for the taking. You should use the insights that this data can provide to you to sharpen your posting habits and make the most of your social media performance.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/5-social-media-trends-to-boost-your-brand-awareness,"Social media is increasingly becoming a part of everyone's everyday life. What began as a way for relatives and friends to remain in touch quickly developed into a way for marketers and businesses to interact with their potential customers through well-crafted marketing campaigns. This post compiles a list of current social media trends that any business must know to boost interaction and online presence in 2022.
Personalized Content
People always yearn for acknowledgement and appreciation. As a result, whatever effort you make at reaching out and cherishing your target market has a massive influence.
98 percent of marketers feel that this helps build customer connections, while 88 percent say that consumers want a tailored experience, according to Evergage. To deliver a customized consumer experience, gather as much audience data as workable, such as identity, address, age, and so on.
Platform Feature Overlapping
If you have a massive following on Instagram, you may want to use stories to inform people about your new product or post a photo of your workspace. But would you prefer your Snapchat community to see the same thing? This is where the overlap of social platforms enters the picture. Although the content may be identical, the outreach and community involvement are the most significant differences.
Social Listening
This entails monitoring your social media outlets for product or topic-related comments and discussions, then evaluating them to find strategies for engaging with potential buyers. You may use this to spice up positive remarks, urge participants to join your brand society campaign, or respond to critical reviews.
Video Marketing
People spend 150 minutes every day on average consuming video content on the internet. Videos are now so prevalent in the lives of consumers that 84 percent of internet users say it motivates them to buy items or services pushed by prominent businesses through video.
There are several social networking developments that will dominate 2022 and have a positive influence on consumers and businesses. If you have not yet adjusted to the upcoming trends, now is the time to do so to maximize your social media exposure and maintain a competitive edge.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/5-steps-to-building-a-great-social-media-strategy,"Social media marketing has become a hugely important part of brand building, connecting with the right target audience, and driving more traffic to your website. That's why you need a solid social media strategy that will help your marketing campaign stand out from your competition. This post discusses five steps to help you build the ultimate social media strategy for your business.
Step 1. Know Your Audience
Who is your ideal customer? By defining your target audience early enough, you will be strategically placed to determine the best time to market and sell your product.
For example, if your ideal customers are young adults aged between 18 and 29, you would be wise to focus on social sites like Facebook or Instagram. On the other hand, if your target audience is composed of graduate-educated and business persons, you would be better off using LinkedIn.
Your ideal customers also determine the type of social media content you'll be advertising.
Step 2. Choose the Right Platform
There's no doubt that all social media platforms have their strengths and limitations. That's why you'll find some businesses thrive best when using some social media platforms over others.
The trick is to find the social media platform that your target audience hangs out on the most. Understand the demographics of your target market and see if that fits into the most prominent demographics that use each platform. Make your decision based on this and you will not fail when choosing the right platform for your brand. And remember, you don't have to boil the ocean and be on them all. Choose one or two platforms and commit to posting regularly on them.
Step 3. Know Your Brand and Products
Before starting a social media content strategy for your business, you must first identify your brand and products or services your target audience finds most valuable and make them the central focus of your posting efforts. Know how to describe your offerings well and provide consistent descriptions of them. Understand why your brand's products or services will fulfill the pain points that your prospects may be experiencing. Feature your differentiators and what makes you better than your competitors.
Step 4. Create Your Content
All your social media planning and advertising strategies should be based on what your target audience is looking for. Great content is the backbone of any impactful social media strategy. But sadly, many businesses skip the first three steps and jump straight to content creation. This strategy is seldom successful, and many professional marketers don't encourage it. You can have the greatest content speaking to the wrong people. So don't skip any steps.
Now that you know your ideal customer, have picked the best social media platform and understand how to describe your brand and products or services, you can create content that sends a statement. Identify those pain points your prospects are experiencing so that they can first relate and then lead them down a path of describing how your products and services will ease that pain for them. Provide educational and/or entertaining content and only promote or sell your products once in a while. No one likes to be sold to all the time. If you provide great, beneficial content to your target audience they will believe you are a thought leader in the industry and will begin to trust in your brand. Down the road it may turn into a sale!
Once you've created a great content plan, start posting! Start with posting at least 5 days a week. The more posting the better as long as you are providing quality content.
Step 5. Review Then Improve Performance
Finally, you'll want to check the stats of your social media campaign frequently to see how it's performing. This will allow you to see which strategies are working and which ones aren't and use this data to update your marketing approach accordingly. If something isn't performing as expected, pause it and take action. Maybe you missed something.
By following these steps, you can build a great social media strategy and bolster your marketing campaign significantly. If you would like to use your social media strategy to its full potential, make the first step: Call Clairant today to see what we can do for your business.

Needless to say, this has also opened the doors for many marketing opportunities as well. It is worth getting your name and/or brand on these live streaming services where so many people are watching games all around the clock.
Vlogs
Blogs used to be all the rage in the 1990s and early 2000s, but that attention has shifted to vlogs now. These are nothing more than video blogs, but people absolutely love to watch them. Marketers can choose to either create their own vlogs or run sponsored ads on vlogs that are already popular with much of the public.
AR/VR
Augmented and virtual reality are making a splash all around the world. While many are not yet comfortable adopting these technologies completely, there are plenty of people who see this as the wave of the future. Thus, it is possible that AR/VR marketing may be the way to go for many.
SEO Optimized Videos
Videos that appear when someone searches for a particular term or phrase are a great way to get relevant videos in front of people who clearly want to view that type of material. SEO-optimized videos are a trend that is taking off in 2022. They can be used both on major search engines such as Google as well as on social media of all varieties.
UGC
UGC stands for user-generated content, and it is believed to be much more impactful with viewers than anything else. They are far more likely to believe that the content that they view from an everyday user is real and beneficial to them. Thus, video marketing teams should try to work with talent that can provide them with the UGC that they need for their next campaign.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/5-vital-spring-cleaning-tasks-for-your-business,"Spring cleaning is when you clean under shelves, the wire tunnels below your home, fix the installation, and remove cobwebs. Spring cleaning isn't just for your home or physical business premises.
Spring clean your systems, too. This article covers the five tasks to clean your business. Clairant can help you get started on these spring cleaning duties for your business. We develop for you a better website and network to attract new customers.
Now, spring cleaning.
1. Re-evaluate your business objectives
Goals and milestones shift with changing times. So your business needs to go back to the drawing board, re-evaluate your business goals, and see if you need to alter them.
You need to divide goals into short-term and long-term goals. Short-term plans are usually objectives to reach in 6 to 12 months, and long-term goals could be beyond five years. Use the SMART strategy; specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely.
2. Review business plan
Your business plan is the blueprint of your business. It contains all the departments plus the roles and responsibilities of all the staff members. Revisit that as well and comb out anything you may not need. And then add what you may need.
3. Revisit the client list
Who are your clients? Have they changed over the years, and do you feel the need to bring in a new demographic onboard with wider business reach?
These are the questions you need to answer when reviewing your client list.
4. Upgrade your marketing
Marketing trends shift each quarter or so. Spring clean your old strategies and upgrade them to modern and efficient strategies that will benefit your business. We are in the age of automation, email marketing, blogging, social media, video marketing, and more: so look into that.
5. Take control of your finances
You must also check each financial affairs. Prioritize your spending to determine what requires more money and what can be trimmed. Using money wisely helps your firm spring clean. To reduce losses, every penny must be accounted for.
If you think these tasks are way too much for you to handle, contact us to see what the buzz is all about at Clairant.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/5-ways-to-improve-your-brands-value,"Branding is more than just a logo or color scheme for your business. It’s just as much about the value of your company as it is about the visual presentation of your company. Even with a small business or a small budget, branding can make a big impression. Here are five ways to make sure you leave the right impression with your branding.
Define your Brand
Know what you’re working with before diving into how to do that work. Pinpoint your values, methods, and target market. The more you know about your brand, the easier it will be to make the most out of your branding.
Think from a Singular Point of View
Your business may be a conglomerate of dozens of workers and processes, so sometimes it can be tough to see the forest from the trees. But in order to properly market your company, you need to look at it from a singular perspective. Doing otherwise often leads to inconsistencies and mixed messages to your audiences.
Keep your Goals in Mind
Staying on track is essential to conveying a sense of purpose, stability, and reliability for your company. Keeping your objectives at the forefront of your marketing decisions is the best way to do so. Before you act, ask yourself (and your team, if need be) if what you’re doing is in the interest of achieving those goals.
Stay Personable
Nobody enjoys seeing ad after ad online, so do your best to stick to personable, authentic, less abrasive promotions. You can still roll out deals and promos, but remember that your brand is about your image above all else, and make sharing that your main priority.
Build Customer Relationships
Building a brand is about creating and strengthening a community with your customers to reinforce their trust in your company. Treating your customers and audience as if they are as essential to your business as the rest of your team increases the likelihood that they’ll choose to do business with you.
Building a brand, refining a brand, and presenting a brand are the cornerstones of any business’s presentation and reputation. Doing all of that while following the guidelines above is a tricky and endless process. Luckily, your business is a few small steps away from perfecting your image, increasing your brand visibility, and raising the return of your marketing efforts. Take that first step today by giving Clairant’s busy bees a call. Together we’ll make the most of your image.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/6-qualities-all-good-logos-have-in-common,"No one thing makes a logo great. It's all subjective, according to target market, industry, and so much more, but there are a few things that good logos all have in common, regardless of audience or industry. Here are the 6 qualities all good logos have in common...
Distinctive
Your logo must be distinct in order to stand out from others in similar industries. When creating your logo, use design elements that aren't currently trendy or widely known, if possible. Your brand should have a unique story, and your logo is the beginning of that story.
Relevant
Your logo must be relevant to the market you are targeting. You want your logo to show your brand's identity, and you can do this by using color, font, and symbols effectively.
Simple
Simplicity is important when it comes to your logo. You want something easy to remember (take the ""Nike swoosh"" for example). This means you should focus on colors and fonts while using as few other graphic elements as possible. You don't want something so busy that it takes away from a logo's main purpose: brand identity.
Timeless
When designing your logo, you want to pick something that will stay relevant over a long period of time. This means you shouldn't choose what's trendy now, as it likely won't be in the future. You want your logo to be making a great impression in the long run, just like your business.
Adaptable
If your logo is adaptable, that means it holds up well in all digital and physical mediums. It should look good when printed and when it is seen online. You should also prepare the design for both web viewing and mobile viewing. A responsive logo varies in size and complexity and can have different colors based on its destination.
Memorable
Finally, you want your logo to be memorable from the first time someone sees it, and you want them to connect with it. The best way to do this is to find a good balance between visuals and text, while remaining unique from others in the industry.
Got a logo design in mind but not sure how to bring it to life? Or maybe don't know where to start all together? We've got you covered. Clairant's team of professional graphic designers are waiting to make your logo the best it can be. Contact us today to get started.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/7-mistakes-your-email-campaigns-should-avoid,"Having customers subscribe to your business's emails is a great way to improve your lead conversion. However, to get the most out of your email nurture campaign, there are a few classic beginner mistakes you should avoid if you want to be an awesome marketing planner. Here are Clairant's top seven tips for creating the most effective email campaigns.
1. Getting Off on the Wrong Foot
When someone new subscribes to your email ID list, you should always greet them with a welcome email. No matter what types of email campaigns you run, set the tone for future communication and let them know what to expect right away when your business is fresh in their mind.
2. Not Having Calls to Action
If you've read our tips on creating effective websites, you should already know how important it is to tell your readers the steps you'd like them to take after reading your content. Emails function the same way: at the end, be sure to include a clear call to action even if it’s something as simple as “check out our website.”
Having a hard time mapping outa comprehensive email? Make sure to include these 5 elements all direct marketing newsletters should use.
3. Not Meeting Expectations
Make sure you're following through with any promises you've made regarding your email frequency and content. When customers trust you with their email addresses, they don't want surprises.
4. Looking Unprofessional
Your emails are an extension of your business and should match it in tone and branding; make sure to have everything personalized as such. Things like spelling mistakes, attachments, and stock images don't send the right message to customers.
5. Using a Sales-Heavy Approach
Everyone gets emails trying to sell them things, and they usually end up in the trash. It sounds cliché, but it's much more effective to send personalized emails that illustrate how your products or services will benefit the reader.
6. Not Being Mobile-Responsive
If you don't optimize your emails for mobile devices, you run the risk of losing many subscribers. Many people open emails on their phones or tablets, so be sure to test how your emails look on those devices.
7. Using Too Many Images
Images are attention-grabbing, but too many can come off as unprofessional. Also, many people have their email settings adjusted to not display images at all.
Not sure how to move forward once you’ve pressed “send?” Learn all about email marketing campaign analytics.
Righting these Wrongs…
Fixing these mistakes is simple but it will have a big impact on the success of your email campaigns. If you'd like more marketing advice that's tailored to the specific needs of your business or are looking for a team to take over as your email campaign developer, schedule a free consultation by contacting us today.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/7-web-design-trends-to-follow-in-2021,"Websites are essential for optimizing business in the current age of competitive digital advertising and marketing. Every company should have a website, and these days most do, even small startups. As such, the importance of creating one that is unique, memorable, and effective cannot be understated. To help you get a better idea of how to make your company’s website stand out, here are the top 7 web design trends to follow this year.
1. Focusing More on Video Content
As discussed in a previous blog and video of ours, video content is booming. The advantages range from faster processing speeds, higher conversion rates, better social media engagement, and much more. Utilizing such a fun and beneficial tool is the perfect way to make your site memorable.
2. Storytelling
With its unique ability to focus on enriching the user experience in a personal and engaging manner, incorporating storytelling elements keeps your site’s visitors entertained and more invested in your site’s messages, and therefore more likely to relate to and trust your brand.
3. Creating Brand-Specific Illustrations
Relying on stock photography and video is still very much a staple of web design, but these days companies are going the extra mile to attach their brand and style to their site’s visual elements. Doing so not only makes your graphics stand out among a sea of stock photo-heavy sites, but it also draws as much attention to your brand as possible, leaving as big an impact on your site’s visitors as possible.
4. Utilizing Typography
Professional, stylish font choices were once impossible to use without breaking the bank. That is, until companies like Google Fonts and Adobe Fonts made them more accessible, and some even free to use. So don’t settle for old seemingly-reliable fonts that everyone is sick of seeing, and opt for more high-quality ones to make your content pop.
5. Simplifying for Faster Load-Time
Nobody likes waiting for anything, and in such a digital world, people won’t think twice about leaving a site rather than waiting a few extra seconds for it to load. By using a simple, clean, minimalist design on your site, you can optimize the load-time to keep your visitors engaged.
6. Mobile-First Designing
It’s no secret that a lot of people rely heavily on their mobile devices for things like social media, but that reliance extends to all aspects of digital connection these days. Tailoring your site to not just accommodate that, but use it to your advantage is becoming more and more popular.
7. Prioritizing SEO
Also as discussed in another one of our previous blogs, SEO (or search engine optimization) is a method of increasing the visibility of your website by making it more likely to show up in search results on sites like Google or Yahoo. Increasing that visibility leads to more traffic to your website, which means more opportunities for converting visitors into customers.
The added value of a company’s website from making a few simple changes is incredible. For even more website tips and tricks, check out ""5-Minute Marketing with Clairant."" And remember, you don't have to navigate the world of online marketing alone. Call us and we can help you make your website the best it can be! Let's start building yours today!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/8-things-every-homepage-needs,"No matter how you design your website or what you use it for, certain elements are necessary to make your homepage a success. This article will discuss the items that make a good homepage and how they aid the online experience for your visitors.
Headline
Our attention span is not that long, and studies show it is getting shorter. You have about three seconds to grab the attention of someone visiting your homepage before they go looking elsewhere for the goods or services you provide. Therefore, your headline should explain to the reader what makes you stand out from your competitors, focuses on the visitors, not you, and uses keywords to improve your SEO ranking.
Hero Image
You should have a central image on your website that represents what your organization stands for. The image will create an excellent first impression and lessen your bounce rate.
Introduction
There are probably thousands of businesses that offer the goods and services that you do. A good introduction and overview will explain to your visitor why they should choose you instead of one of your competitors.
Content Blocks
Contents blocks are short sentences and phrases that introduce your services and explain the benefits you offer. Right now, content blocks are trending because they are aesthetically pleasing on mobile devices.
Call to Action
A call to action tells your visitor what action you want them to take at your website. The activity can be as simple as clicking a link to watch a video to more complex information, or filling out a survey on how they heard about your company.
Portfolio or Client Logos
A portfolio allows visitors to get an idea of what your company does through images instead of words. Portfolios can be compelling for businesses that deal with aesthetics, like architecture firms.
Testimonials
Studies show that people are easily swayed by others' opinions. Testimonials are good reviews from clients who were happy with your goods or services.
Contact Information
You want to keep people on your homepage instead of having to go to another page to contact you. In addition, adding contact information to your homepage lessens a visitor's chance to leave your site and go to a competitor.
The whole idea of a homepage is to keep visitors there long enough to convert them into customers. Adding these eight items to your homepage increases your chance of success. If you want to improve your homepage, make the first step: call Clairant today!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/advantages-of-choosing-agency-marketing-over-in-house-marketing,"When it comes to making choices about marketing, companies who have never hired an agency before might not know what to expect, or what kind of return on investment they could get. It's important to understand your options, so we've compiled a list of a few advantages agency marketing has over in-house marketing.
Efficiency
An agency is able to focus solely on marketing, which means you can get the results you want more quickly. An assembled in-house marketing team on the other hand will probably have their attention divided among other issues that companies are dealing with. This means it could take longer to see success from your efforts.
Access to Cutting-Edge Software
Agencies have access to tools and software that in-house teams might not be able to afford or even be aware of. For agencies, marketing is our whole world, so we know all the latest tricks and secrets.
Better Return on Investment
When you work with an experienced partner, you really get the most value from digital marketing. If you want to make the best use possible of your marketing budget, then you need to work with an expert who has a history of success. Experienced agencies offer this, and will get you the best return on your investment.
Marketing Expertise
A marketing agency's team comes with a myriad of skills, training, and experience that in-house teams just aren't capable of. Agencies like Clairant are fluent in all the best practices and marketing tactics, and we are always up to date on the latest trends.
Scalability
An agency is significantly more efficient at scaling compared to an in-house marketing team. Agencies can quickly improve your presence across social media networks or can increase your paid advertising efforts during a busy season. It would take an in-house marketing team a lot more time and effort to achieve the results that an agency can do in a single afternoon.
If you're considering the best way to improve your marketing, it's worth it to hire an agency. Clairant has helped make all kinds of businesses successful, and we make the best use of your time and marketing budget.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/best-ways-to-capture-leads-on-your-website,"If capturing leads on your website was as easy as clicking an ""optimize now"" button on your website builder, everyone would do it! Unfortunately, a lot of planning, analytics, and testing go into making your website a lead-generating machine.
Though the prospect may seem daunting, you can incorporate dozens of marketing, design, and even psychological strategies into your website to start churning leads out. The best way to start? Give users content that they're happy to consume! Add value to their lives and show (not tell) visitors why they need you!
We've narrowed hundreds of marketing techniques down to 10 that we stand by to help you figure out how to capture leads from your website.
Optimize your landing pages
You may have heard it repeatedly, but optimizing your landing pages is one of the most efficient ways of securing leads.
Firstly, identify your busiest, most effective, and longest-visited pages. Since these pages are already bringing traffic in, they have the best lead potential.
HubSpot, one of the largest business marketing software companies, found that websites with over 30 landing pages produced seven times more leads than websites with less than ten landing pages.
Thank-you pages are also often overlooked. Imagine how customers might feel if they invested time, money, and effort into becoming a website lead capture to feel like another statistic on paper. Customers want to feel appreciated. Directing them to thank-you pages after a purchase, sign-up, or otherwise can be the differentiating factor if they come back to you versus the competition.
Add call-to-action forms to the pages that get the most traffic
A simple lead capture tactic is adding call-to-action forms throughout your website, including those high-traffic landing pages. Calls to action can be electronic mailing list prompts, discount codes, or short surveys. Adding lead generator pop-ups for your homepage and landing pages is a trivial yet very influential marketing tactic.
Some good practices for calls-to-action (CTAs) are:
Use strong verbs to communicate what you want a visitor to do clearly. Phrases like ""sign up today,"" ""checkout now,"" ""fill out a one-minute survey,"" and ""enter your email"" are good starting points.
CTAs are also helpful in instigating FOMO (fear of missing out). If you prompt a visitor to ""enter their email now to receive a 20% off coupon"", they fear that if they don't give you their email, they'll miss out on the deal.
You may or may not reuse the prompts; many websites will show you the same pop-up every time (or every ""x"" number of visits) you return to the page.
Measure lead generator performance with KPIs to determine which strategies are working
How do you determine if all your effort is worth it? You may follow industry practices, use calls to action, and optimize your high-traffic landing pages with lead generators, but where's the value? Key performance indicators or KPIs are the magic statistics that make or break your marketing tactics.
While planning (or before you employ) lead-generating tools and strategies into your website, it's a good idea to determine what will make them successful. Will they increase traffic by 50%? Will they increase the time spent on the page by 5 seconds? 10 seconds? When will these performance metrics be met, and how often will you need to monitor them?
Develop S.M.A.R.T. goals for your lead generation ideas. Use them to determine if your plan to use google forms to collect email addresses is working or if it should get thrown in the ""lead capture tool"" recycle bin.
Publish case studies, reviews, anecdotes, and success stories
Posting case studies and success stories are great ways to show results to viewers. Some studies show that adding real-customer reviews and success stories can improve conversion rates by up to 20%! However, if you have adverse reports, it's important to nurture those anecdotes, and you may be able to post redemption arcs for your brand. Most consumers respect transparent and honest brands.
Create specialty landing pages
Specialty landing pages are designed to host lead magnets—for example, a sign-up form for catered mailing lists for small businesses. CTAs, and buttons on the bottom of your website pages are as good as invisible to some customers. Specialty landing pages help increase actions taken by visitors.
Use interactive content at every stage of the buyer's journey
The Content Marketing Institute predicted that interactive content would be one of the most important aspects of lead generation in the coming years. They note it as one of the best ways to increase brand awareness and secure visitors as leads.
At each stage of the buyer's journey, the early stage (discovery), the middle stage (consideration), and the late stage (decision), there should constantly be a CTA, prompt, task, or activity for your potential lead to do.
For example, at the discovery stage, The Content Marketing Institute determined that assessments, contests, games, interactive infographics, and quizzes had the highest conversion rates, with an average increase of over 60%!
Use live chat and connection forms
It may seem trivially simple, but people like talking to people! Live chats are not only great lead generators, but they're great for customer service as well!
If you cannot dedicate resources to 24/7 support, investing in a chatbot that can handle basic queries is still a significant element to include on your website. Chatbots are so helpful; Salesforce recommends that you should use them for lead generation and even sales! They're a little more effective than adding an email, name, and address to a mailing list just for a user to unsubscribe from it!
Facebook leads
For those that do not have a website but want a piece of the lead generation pie, Facebook offers a solution. Facebook leads don't automatically convert to email addresses. However, all these ad-viewers have to do is tap on the ad, and pre-populated forms appear.
These contact forms are automatically populated with users' information, making it incredibly easy for viewers to convert to leads. Facebook lead ads are a great way to get affordable marketing lists and quickly transfer them to your website!
You can embed Facebook posts on your website, so you don't need to stress about finding how to optimize leads to work on a blog page!
Make visitors feel a sense of urgency
Urgency and scarcity are marketing techniques as old as time. However, they're still highly relevant and valuable throughout countless industries today. A sense of urgency can come from our FOMO, a deadline, timer, or counting-down clock front-and-center on a CTA.
Slight hints of pressure can be all it takes to convert a passerby to a strong lead. Some may dislike this marketing strategy but remember the last time you impulsively gave away your email address to secure a 25% off coupon for an online shop. What were you thinking at that moment?
Nurture and cultivate leads
Once you secure a lead, ideally by making it easy for them to join your club, they can likely just as quickly leave. Keeping an email marketing database or a leads blog can maintain, preserve, and nurture the leads you've already gained and continue to enrich their lives.
Consumers love brands that make them feel like people rather than customers. They'll turn into free marketers, advertising your services whenever they go because they feel appreciated and valued. This is especially effective with business-to-business (B2B) lead generation and commercial email marketing. These industries, like many others, are tightly-knit, and networking is imperative to remain relevant.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/bridging-the-gap-between-big-marketing-goals-and-a-small-budget,"It’s no secret that goal-oriented businesses thrive when they have the means to fund those goals. However, many businesses just don’t have the capital to reach their highest potential - or so they might think. In truth, any business no matter the size or budget can achieve their biggest dreams if they have the right tools and strategies, especially when it comes to marketing. Here are some strategies that your company can benefit from without breaking the bank.
Leverage Social Media
With a variety of platforms reaching millions upon millions of users worldwide, social media is a highly effective tool for maximizing your brand’s visibility and promoting your business. Depending on your target demographic, social media may be exactly where you should be putting the most effort into.
Start Blogging
Like social media, blogging is also about organic exposure. Creating and maintaining a blog will help you establish a reputation as a thought leader in your industry, which in turn will lead to a larger, more engaged audience. Being a guest author on other related blogs will also draw even more attention to your own, so don’t be afraid to reach out to other sites.
Send Out Email Campaigns
With a plethora of accessible and affordable email hosting services online, it’s easier than you might imagine to follow through with a successful email campaign and newsletter strategy. Sending weekly email blasts, monthly newsletters, and other promotional content has never been easier. Email marketing takes your content right into the hands of your potential clients, whether online or right on their phone.
Host Webinars
Hosting webinars has ultimately a very similar effect to that of blogging; it boosts your image as a reputable source of information, therefore making your audience more inclined to trust not only your judgement, but also your business acumen. Moreover, successful or well-circulated webinars can lead to more speaking opportunities at industry-related events.
Optimize Your Website
In this age, not investing your time into your website is a major risk that just isn’t worth taking. Although your marketing may gain attention from outside sources like your social media or email campaigns, for many visitors, your website will be the blueprint for their first impression of your business. A lacking website conveys a sense of carelessness, whereas a professional-looking website reflects well on your business.
Even with the savings you’ll have, given that you stick to the guidelines above, marketing for any company is a large task. Although it may not break the bank, it is still exhausting and at times very confusing to know the right strategy to use. At Clairant, we’re experienced in making those processes as easy as possible for you and your company, so you can get all the benefits of your big marketing dreams without spending too much time or money. Give us a call today to get started.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/chief-customer-officer-create-a-customer-success-team,"If there's anything that COVID-19 has taught businesses, it's the importance of customer retention. In these uncertain times, a company's ability to keep its customers happy and engaged could be the difference between survival and failure. And as the customer becomes more powerful, the role of the Chief Customer Officer (CCO) grows alongside it.
What does a CCO do? Simply put, they are a company's strongest advocate for the customer. A CCO is a C-suite role that focuses on maximizing customer relationships and loyalty. CCOs also handle their company's posture on customer experience, service, and success—handling everything from ensuring secure customer data practices to designing customer-centric policies.
One of the most important responsibilities of a CCO is to create and manage a customer success team. This team is responsible for ensuring that customers can achieve their desired outcomes with your product or service. Team members work closely with the sales and support teams to help customers get the most out of your company's offerings.
Customer success teams are especially popular in the age of Software as a Service (SaaS). SaaS products are often more flexible and customizable than traditional software, which can make them more complex to use. As a result, customers need more guidance to get the most out of them and keep paying month after month.
Different industries and companies will have different approaches to customer success, but there are five best practices that all CCOs should keep in mind:
1. Don't Skip the Onboarding Process
Too many companies skip or rush their onboarding process, leaving employees to fend for themselves as they try to become familiar with the company's products and services. This is a recipe for disaster, as customers will quickly become frustrated with staff who are unable to provide them with the assistance they need.
Make sure your onboarding process is thorough and covers all of the basics that your employees will need to know to be successful. Use active verbs such as ""explain,"" ""demonstrate,"" and ""teach"" to make it clear that this is an instructional process. And don't forget to include a review of your company's policies and procedures so that everyone is on the same page.
2. Use Surveys to Map the Customer Journey
You can't improve what you don't measure, and surveys are one of the best ways to get feedback from your customers.
Each customer's journey is different, so it's important to get feedback at various touchpoints along the way. This will help you identify areas of improvement and optimize the customer experience.
One thing to keep in mind is to hit that sweet spot between too little and too much communication. You don't want to bombard your customers with surveys, but you also don't want to go too long without getting feedback.
The bottom line is that surveys are a valuable tool for understanding your customers and ensuring their satisfaction. Use them wisely, and you'll be on your way to success!
3. Automate Where You Can
Automation brings a host of benefits to any customer success team. It can help you keep track of customer engagement, identify at-risk customers, and free up your team’s time so they can focus on high-touch activities.
Examples of processes you can automate without breaking the bank:
Remember to be judicious about which tasks you automate. You don’t want to lose the personal touch that can make your team so successful. Some tasks are best left to humans, like building relationships and solving complex problems. When in doubt, err on the side of personalization and human interaction—you never know when a small gesture will go a long way.
4. Offer a Self-Service Option
Providing self-service options can be a game-changer for your business. For many customers, going through a company's customer service process is a last resort. More often than not, customers would rather find the answer to their question on their own using a search engine or company website.
To get started, consider creating a list of the most frequently asked questions by your customers. Then, write down clear and concise answers to each question, using terms that are easy to understand. Once you have a solid foundation of content, you can start building out your knowledge base by adding new articles and sections as needed.
You don't have to limit yourself to text, either—you can also include videos and images to help explain complex concepts. And if you're looking to go above and beyond, you can even create interactive content, like quizzes or infographics.
Note that your self-service options don't have to be perfect. What matters is that they’re available and that they evolve with your customers’ needs.
5. Touch Base with Other Departments
Customer service is just one spoke on the wheel of success. To make your team even more effective, encourage transparency and communication with other departments in your company. When customer service knows what's going on in product, engineering, marketing, and sales, they can make sure every issue is getting the attention it deserves—and keeping customers happy becomes a team effort.
Developing and maintaining open communication lines can be difficult, but there are a few things you can do to make it easier:
Your customer service team leaders--from the VP of customer success to the Chief Customer Officer—should model the kind of behavior they want to see from their reps. If they're not willing to open up the lines of communication, it'll be that much harder for everyone else.
More and more companies are looking to their CCOs to build and lead customer success teams.
These teams can spell the difference between a one-time buyer and a lifelong advocate. When customers are successful, they not only continue to use your product or service but also become their biggest advocates.
Following the five tips above will help you create a customer success team that can take your company to the next level! And if you’re looking to take your business all the way to the top, consider Clairant Services. We’re dedicated to helping our clients thrive!
Contact us today to get started.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/clairants-step-by-step-guide-to-writing-great-website-content,"The marketplace has shifted to digital mediums, underscoring the importance of content marketing. The role of content is to provide answers to your audience, which sets in motion a business relationship based on trust. Consequently, great content plays a central role in retaining an audience, enhancing brand awareness, building authority, ranking better, and lead generation.
So, how can you generate great website content?
Step 1. Define Your Website's Purpose
You can achieve a lot with a website. However, you need to identify its purpose to be effective. For instance, you can use a website as an e-commerce site for branding, enhancing your online presence, generating leads, or selling products. Having a defined purpose is critical in generating content ideas, keyword research, and coming up with an effective marketing strategy.
Step 2. Know Your Audience
Content that is not user-centered may not achieve its objective. Therefore, businesses need to factor in audience aspects like motivations, goals, behaviors, pain points, needs, and challenges. This knowledge helps create meaningful content with relatable vocabulary and an enhanced user experience.
Step 3. Research Competitors
After gaining an understanding of your audience, perform a competitive analysis. The process reveals gaps and opportunities that you can utilize to attract more traffic and rank better. First, create a list of 3-5 competitors, ranking keywords, and overall content strategy. Also, look at the number of blogs, content length, and diversity of topics.
Step 4. Implement SEO Keywords
Keyword research is crucial in creating focused content and attracting specific traffic from search engines. Short-tail or long-term keywords tell you how internet users are looking for information. Use keyword research tools like Ahrefs, Google Keyword Planner, or SEMrush to find content ideas.
Step 5. Content Writing
It's time to create website content using keywords, research, and inspiration from the above steps. The secret of great content is an SEO web copy that's adequately formatted with H1, H2, and H3, with localized content or long-form texts.
Are You Ready to Transform Your Marketing?
Great content is the foundation of marketing that generates leads, enhances brand growth, and ultimately increases sales. Therefore, it's essential to undertake key prerequisite steps like identifying the audience, keyword research, and competitive analysis.
That said, Clairant is here to help you. We offer various services like web design, lead nurturing, social media maintenance, and video marketing. Call Clairant today!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/contact-info-what-where-why,"Including adequate information on how people can contact your business on your company website may sound like common sense, but there’s more to it than meets the eye. So, let’s go over exactly what that entails, where it should be displayed on your site, and why those two things should not be overlooked.
What
Plain and simple, contact information is any and all references as to how visitors of your website can contact your business for any purpose whatsoever. And when it comes to exactly what details you should include, it’s often best to overdeliver rather than risk giving visitors too little. Sometimes it’s a matter of visitors’ preferences or accessibility to certain means of communication over others, so covering all your bases is a safe bet.
Here are our recommendations for the most vital details to provide:
Where & Why
This information should be located on your website, yes, but where? Well, think of it from your site’s visitors’ perspective - what would be the easiest and least frustrating way? Much like the amount of details to include, we recommend being generous when choosing where this info is located as well. Having it all in only one place makes it less likely that visitors will see it (whether they’re looking for it or not), so try putting it in a few key locations - not everywhere, but where it counts most.
Here’s where that info should show up, and why:

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/easter-bunny-nightmare,"This Easter Sunday we woke up to a gorgeous morning with the sun rising in clear skies and the kids' voices bright and early wondering if the Easter Bunny laid any of its eggs in our yard. After peering through the windows they could see from a distance that indeed, the mysterious creature had shown up in the middle of the night leaving behind treasure for the kids. Before the hunt and while the kids ate breakfast, I had made my way out to the chicken coop to collect the eggs but saw that some of the Easter Bunny’s gifts had been tampered with. I walked over to observe the aftermath of a disaster.
As you can see in the video, egg after egg had been opened by a thief and the candy inside had been unwrapped and consumed. Even packages had been torn open and the insides devoured. One after the other a trail of opened eggs led me to a very happy animal’s journey through the night of finding my children’s Easter chocolates. Whatever animal this was had the dexterity of a human and unwrapped the candy exactly where the eggs were laid, devoured the candy and moved on to the next. Thankfully only about 30-40% of the eggs were consumed and after carefully cleaning up the evidence of an animal’s Easter night adventure the kids did not even notice almost half their treasure had been looted.
This is a lesson to be learned for the Easter Bunny. Don’t lay your eggs in the middle of the night. Hahah! Wake up super early instead? Has anyone else ever had this experience? It gave me a good laugh during this crazy time in the world and certainly makes for a good story to tell! Happy Easter everyone!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/educating-your-target-audience-with-webinars,"Webinars are a key component of networking and pitching these days (something many people have come to learn over the past year). They are an ultra-powerful tool for connection and are constantly rising in popularity. Whether you’re unconvinced of their value or are just interested in learning more about how your company can prosper, we’ve compiled a list of the top six benefits of hosting a webinar...
Keep your audience engaged
Webinars offer tremendous value when it comes to audience engagement. Not only do viewers spend hours on end watching content centered around your business, but they also have the opportunity to ask questions in real-time. The more your prospects focus on your business, the more likely they are to buy.
Classify yourself as an industry expert
As easy as it may seem to speak in front of a camera about your own industry, it still conveys intelligence and experience in your field, and customers are more likely to trust those who know what they’re doing. Thoughtful webinars play on the strengths and knowledge your company exudes, which leads to higher conversion rates.
Teach and sell at the same time
Rather than presenting for an hour and closing with a sales pitch, you can best utilize webinars by doing these simultaneously to make the process easier for yourself and make the decision to buy seem organic to your customers or prospects.
Expand your customer base
Virtual space allows people from around the globe to access your content. Whereas speaking at a conference or similar event will reach hundreds of prospects, hosting a webinar has the potential to reach thousands, if not millions. Not to mention how much easier it is to click “record” from home on your laptop instead of planning and hosting an in-person event.
Establish new network connections
When networking, it’s always more prudent to demonstrate your knowledge in an industry. Doing so is more effective than not when convincing a potential contact to pursue a professional relationship with you or your company. Use webinars to leave a great first impression on new contacts to get them coming back for more.
Receive measurable results
Understanding exactly who your content is reaching, what content receives the most attention, and more can help you perfect your webinars in the future. Luckily, the magic of technology allows you to track a wide range of metrics surrounding your webinar, be it registration earnings, earnings per click, watch times, view count, and more.
By now you know why you should invest your time in creating webinars, but there are still logistical hurdles ahead if you plan on hosting your own. To skip the hassle and get right to the payoff, look to Clairant. We’re here for all of your marketing needs, and make sure your webinars are nothing short of a spectacular success. Get started today with Clairant.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/hiring-a-fractional-cmo-is-it-worth-it,"A fractional CMO is a marketing executive contracted to help with customer acquisition, sales development, and company growth. They are involved in the marketing strategy and ongoing goals of a business.
Here are five signs that contracting a fractional CMO might make sense for your small business.
1. Lacking marketing leadership on your team
Marketing managers track and analyze the performance of advertising campaigns, manage the marketing budget and ensure that all marketing material is in line with your brand identity. A fractional CMO can work with your team to enhance their skills and help drive efficient and effective organizational communications to the next level.
2. Having no marketing plan
A good marketing plan is key to marketing success. Failure to develop a functional marketing plan can lead to budget issues, low customer volume, and, in the worst-case scenario, business closure.
A fractional CMO will craft a marketing plan that can help you:
3. Not knowing how to delegate
Leaders who fear the prospect of failure may cling to work and refuse to delegate. They feel they need to take charge and deliver the work personally to ensure it is done correctly. You should learn to delegate anything that someone else can do better. Otherwise, you'll be doing a disservice to your employees and your business.
4. Lacking implementation resources in marketing
Besides people, structure, systems, and culture, resources are vital to implementing your marketing strategy. Without the necessary implementation resources, it'll be difficult for your business to put your marketing strategy into real-life practice to drive valuable results.
5. Lacking tech platforms for automation
Businesses use marketing automation platforms as a hosted or web-based solution to streamline sales and marketing efforts. A marketing automation specialist can help you automate online marketing campaigns and sales activities to increase revenue and maximize efficiency.
Your team will get more time to focus on overall strategy and nurturing the leads that show real promise. This ultimately translates to more prospects and more customers.
If your marketing staff requires more direction and industry experience to move your business forward, it could be time to hire a fractional CMO. Your business will get executive expertise without the full-time cost. Call Clairant today!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/how-can-we-be-social-and-still-follow-social-distancing-rules,"During these times of social isolation it is easy to retreat into your own world and stay out of touch with family and friends. I personally find myself talking to less and less people every day. But don’t get caught in a downward spiral of being even more isolated than we have to be.
There are ways we can be social, other than virtual Zoom meetings, and still abide by the social distancing rules.
Are there people in your life you haven't checked in on? Check on your parents, grandparents and elderly friends. Bring them meals or go shopping for them.
Meet in a backyard and kick the soccer ball around, throw the baseball back and forth or a frisbee. Walk, bike or run 6 feet apart.
I was jogging the other day and saw neighbors with their lawn chairs set up in one driveway about 15 feet apart with delicious drinks in everyone’s hands. Another friend of mine had a lovely family dinner outside and set up folding tables and chairs all over the yard 6 feet apart. Each immediate family sat at their own table but they could still be with their extended family and friends who were at other tables sharing a nice meal in the same yard.
Play bocce ball or lawn bowling, horse shoes, or bean bag toss.
Offer to help your loved ones with gardening or other yard work. Paint a fence, dig a trench, cut up branches in your yard for an outdoor fire.
Instead of cooking inside, roast hotdogs or sausages on the fire pit outside. Then roast marshmallows for dessert! :)
The weather is starting to turn so let's take advantage of the warmth, be social and stay safe and healthy all at the same time.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/how-does-good-branding-affect-companies,"Many business owners underestimate the role that having a strong brand identity plays in the success of their company. Seemingly simple elements, like font or color choices, actually convey a lot of information about your business to potential customers. There are several significant ways that good branding can affect your company.
1. Good Branding Improves Customer's Understanding
The colors, font, and logo of your business is the quickest way to communicate to customers what your business is about. Customers form their opinion quickly, so everything they see matters. Color, in particular, ""are the essence of successful branding, one that touches viewers on an emotional level,"" according to an in-depth study on color's role in branding, presented by LogoDesign.
2. It Creates Memorability
An effective brand identity is one that is highly memorable. Customers should remember seeing your brand and walk away with a lasting impression because if customers can recall a company's branding, they are more likely to purchase from them. One university study found that having a consistent color scheme increased brand recognition by 80%.
3. It Conveys professionalism
A brand image that conveys professionalism will make people more likely to trust your products and services. When choosing between two competitors, customers will prefer the business that has a trustworthy, professional appearance over one that is unprofessional or poorly designed.
4. Branding Can Create Loyalty
Strong branding makes customers take notice. Having a highly identifiable brand can create strong feelings in customers and those feelings are what drives loyalty. When your brand presents an image customers enjoy, they're more likely to use your services exclusively.
5. Good Branding Boosts Sales
Content that is personal to your brand is more eye-catching and likely to convince customers to buy than other types of marketing, such as paid search advertising. Customized content is engaging and can cause customers to prefer your brand.
Creating a strong brand image plays a huge role in the level of success that companies see. Even small decisions, such as color schemes, can have a big impact on customer loyalty and sales. If your business could use an image overhaul, contact Clairant to start establishing your branding today!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/how-to-create-effective-landing-pages,"Your website's landing pages are where customers get a lasting impression of your business. After clicking on one of your ads or email links, the landing page is where they go to find out more about your company. To entice customers to stay and learn more, it's critical that this page be as effective as possible. Keep reading to discover the top four aspects of successful landing pages.
Your Company's Name and Logo
Presenting cohesive branding throughout all of your online spaces is an important way to look polished, professional, and facilitate brand recognition. Your landing page should have your company's logo and match your website's branding.
An Attention-Grabbing Headline
Including a headline or the offer itself at the top of your page is important for getting customers' attention and drawing them in to learn more.
A Description of Product Benefits
Go beyond the basics and paint a clear picture of how your services will benefit customers. Rather than presenting a list of features, paint a vivid picture of how your services will improve customers' lives. Consider providing a freebie or other incentives to encourage further interest.
A Picture of Your Product or Service
Pictures are much more visually impactful than a wall of text and make it more likely for customers to spend time on your page. They also help customers quickly and clearly understand what you're offering.
A Call to Action
Always make sure you're guiding customers to take the next steps. At the bottom of your landing page, encourage them to contact you with questions, or provide a form for them to fill out so that they can sign up immediately.
When designing landing pages, always make sure they relate directly to the link customers use to access them. To convert the most leads, landing pages should continue the customer's journey, not send them back to your home page. If you follow our tips, you will start drawing in leads like bees to their queen. Developing a successful marketing strategy is simple with help from our experts. Get started on your personalized plan by contacting Clairant today!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/how-to-entertain-inspire-and-wow-a-customer-using-direct-mail,"In our current world, as we have heavily shifted to digital lives, it seems as though our junk mail has decreased in these last few years. We have this misconception that direct mail is useless and ineffective and as a result, there has been a decline in marketers using direct mail to promote their products or services. When the traffic dies down on a channel there is no better time to explore that channel and get noticed! So start using the road less travelled and make a splash with the old-school direct mail method. Here are two tricks that will make your direct mail campaign more effective thanks to the One page marketing plan.
Each day we collect our mail from the mailbox and sort it into piles. We keep the things that seem interesting and important, and throw out, without opening, the things that seem redundant and unimportant.
Do you ever throw out mail with random lumpy objects in the envelopes?
No, I don’t either. I always at least open it to see what treasure I may find. Because of this you need to put something lumpy in your mail to ensure it stands out and gets put in the important pile when potential customers are opening it. This could be a sample of your product, magnets, some coupons or gift cards, a stress ball, or some free knickknacks with your branding on them. Give them a free book. People almost never throw out books. A branded shot glass! I know I would NEVER throw out one of those! 😜
The point is to get your brand in front of these potential customers and that means first to get them to open the mail and second to give them something to remember your brand.
The second trick is for leads or prospects you already are aware of. Send them a wow factor box. A package they will absolutely have to open because the suspense is killing them and we all like random surprise packages. In the package along with your amazing marketing material give them something of high value. This could be a mug, a baseball, a hat, shirts or other apparel with your branding on it. You could send an edible arrangement, a basket of fruit, cookies or a jar of chocolate covered nuts. The possibilities are endless and try to think of something that you would almost never throw away.
When people receive random gifts for no reason in the mail it gives them that wow factor and it also makes them feel obligated to eventually buy from you one day. Us humans often live by an “I’ll scratch your back, you scratch mine” philosophy. We feel obligated to give to people who have given to us. I literally do it ALL the time! So take advantage of human nature and give a little. It will pay off in the end in revenue.
Side note* I am not at all saying to stop digital marketing. Digital marketing is super effective but direct mail can be used in conjunction with other channels of marketing.
As for the wow factor box and the lumpy mail idea, make sure you know the lifetime value of a customer so that you can do the math properly when deciding how much to spend on marketing campaigns such as these. Know your potential ROI. If the numbers do not make sense don’t do it. But at the same time do not be cheap and go above and beyond what your competitors would do.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/how-to-optimize-metadata-for-your-website,"Optimizing the metadata of your website is critical if ranking on search engines is a priority for your business. Here are a few steps to get you started with optimizing your website and controlling the information that pops up on the SERP (search engine results page).
Choose a good SEO plugin
Most website building platforms these days have a built in SEO plugin. If you don’t already have one built into your site, choose a good SEO plug-in to add to your website. Do research on the best plug-ins for your platform. For example WordPress provides a great SEO plug-in called Yost.
Meta tags on each page
It is not enough to fill out the section for general meta tags (metatags) on your site. Filling in the meta tags for each page is required for effective SEO. In order to do this correctly you need to find a good keyword research tool so that you can fill in your best keywords for each page. Currently I use UberSuggest. It is a free keyword research tool from Neil Patel that is super effective for suggesting keywords and finding analytics and trends on current popular keywords. Fill in as many popular keywords as you can in the keyword meta tag section for each page.
Create effective meta descriptions
After you conduct keyword research and you have your lists for each page, then you can start filling in the meta descriptions. Make sure you don’t just copy and paste what is already on the public facing side of your page. The point is to create content that will come up on the SERP (search engine results page) when people search for keywords that will lead to your site. Essentially you are promoting each page on your site through these meta-descriptions. You want to draw people into the page by promoting it with your meta description. You are giving them a reason to click and read more. Tell them why they need to find more info on that topic and why they should click on your link versus the competitor above or below you.. How will it benefit their lives and what are they missing out on if they don’t read more.
Page titles
Next you want to choose an effective title for each page. The title could include a popular keyword that is trendy for the content that happens to be on that page. Again, you want to draw people into the page by creating a catchy title where they will have no choice but to click to view more.
Make sure to pay attention to character limits or character suggestions. There may not be limits to each section for characters but there are optimal character suggestions that you should follow so that people are exposed to the full story before it cuts you off on the SERP in order to draw them into each page. Generally 30 to 60 characters for the Page Titles and 140 characters for the meta descriptions.
Get started on your site!!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/how-to-perfect-your-lead-nurturing-technique,"When it comes to lead nurturing, a lot of factors are at play. The effectiveness of your marketing team’s efforts are reliant mostly on your potential customers’ habits and needs. Although those are two things you don’t have control over, you can increase your marketing effectiveness by doing a few key things on your end of the deal. Here are 5 ways to perfect your lead nurturing and boost your conversion rates:
1. Focus on targeted content
Not every marketing strategy works on everybody, but sometimes you can use that to your advantage. Figuring out what kinds of language, format, ad, or otherwise works best for your audience - whether by trial and error, A&B testing, or previous experience - will help you land more leads. Not only that, but targeted marketing also brings in bigger sales too!
2. Don’t stick to just one channel
Just as marketing moved from in-person connections to print then to email marketing, the most effective strategies are still progressing. So don’t just stick to your same old email campaigns (although we’re not saying get rid of them!); branch out into social media, paid retargeting, website content, marketing automation, and more.
3. Be persistent and have a schedule
Buyers often come across marketing touches several times before they’re persuaded to buy, so don’t lose your momentum before they make that decision. Stay on target and stay active. Notice a contact hasn’t opened an email? Adjust it and resend! If you follow through with marketing, they’ll follow through with the buying process.
4. Latency to a lead
Just like it’s important to have several marketing touches for leads to encounter, it’s also important to follow-up with those leads as soon as you can. No matter how much marketing material buyers come across, your efforts may be in vain if you don’t respond to prospects that reach out asap. Give them your full attention right away or they just might switch over to someone who will.
5. Coordinate with your sales team
We’ve probably all been in a situation where a product or service doesn’t live up to the expectations they promise. Don’t make that mistake with your own marketing efforts. Aligning your marketing team with your sales team means holding each other accountable for nurturing and converting leads properly. Not only will doing so prevent some very unhappy customers, but it will also lead to your company running more efficiently with better communication.
Seem like a little (or maybe much) too much to handle on your own? Don't worry. With Clairant, you don't have to worry about perfecting your technique; we'll perfect it for you. Start boosting your conversion rates today with Clairant.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/how-to-prioritize-with-a-marketing-plan,"To grow your business, stay competitive, and increase profits, you need to build a solid digital marketing plan. There are certain steps you need to take when developing such a plan, especially for small businesses looking to save as much money as possible. Although each business’s marketing goals vary, these four steps will help you achieve whatever those goals may be.
Define Identities
When getting started in marketing, there are two main identities that are essential to define before moving forward: your target market’s identity and your brand identity. To create a personalized, effective approach and make the greatest impact with your marketing efforts, you have to determine exactly who you are marketing towards. Once you know who you are marketing to, utilize your brand identity as the basis of all connections you make. Your brand identity is a collection of elements that your company creates to portray the essence of your business to its consumers in an effort to persuade them.
Develop an Online Presence
It is more important than ever before to invest in an online presence for your business. If executed well, your online persona can make the difference between success and failure for your company. Keep in mind that being online doesn’t only mean building a stellar website and social media accounts; it also means doing your due diligence on exactly what content to include and where. Choosing the right platforms to present your business on and utilizing tools like search engine optimization are imperative.
Utilize Content Marketing
Any form of online content is only relevant for so long and will only maintain visibility for a short while. So, building expertly-designed websites and social media profiles can only remain beneficial so long as you consistently update it with strong content. Running an awesome company blog with industry-specific and entertaining content is one way to utilize your site to the best of its ability, maintain your online audience/followers, and keep your business visible on search engines.
Invest in Paid Advertising
With paid advertising, you purchase ad space that allows you to specifically target audiences, instead of waiting for them to find you organically. If done strategically, it can be an excellent way to steer more traffic to your website, bring in new customers, get leads, and increase brand awareness. Paid marketing space is typically displayed on social media channels as well as search engine results pages.
Any one of these tasks is a lot to consider, let alone implement properly. When it comes to digital marketing, the most effective and sensible way to make a difference is by hiring a marketing agency to do the strategizing and heavy lifting for you. At Clairant, we have decades of experience in marketing businesses of all sizes, so we’re ready for any goal you have in mind for your company. Get started here.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/how-to-retain-clients-during-covid19,"At this point we have all seen the effects of a pandemic on our businesses and retaining a customer is more important now than ever. With people tightening up their wallets and conserving funds while we all figure out how long this will last, businesses need to be thinking about how to retain current clients. It is more expensive for a small business to acquire new customers than it is to retain them, and repeat or existing customers will spend on average 33% more than a new customer. So let's talk about some ways we can keep these customers coming back for more and maintain loyalty to your brand.
Showcase how you impact your customers’ lives
As business owners we are inclined to talk about features of our products and services and we forget how well these features impact our customers’ lives. In a newsletter, video or social post, talk about how a customers’ life was changed because of your product or service. If you are a health care provider talk about all the things your customers can do now that they couldn’t do before you healed them. If you sell mattresses describe people with back pain before they bought your bed and how their pain improved after they made that investment in your brand. Case studies are a great way to convey this message. You can create a video about it and then take the audio from it. Then write an article and add visuals. There are so many ways you can show how your customers are impacted by your brand!
Optimize your products or services
With the new world heading in the direction of technology many products and services need to be optimized in order to meet the demand of your customers. This may mean gyms or fitness centers offering online classes or personal training sessions. Instead of needing equipment, show your customers how they can use homemade items for weights and resistance. If you offer consulting then meet on zoom or google hangout instead of giving advice in person. If you sell books or information in tangible forms, offer downloadable products. If you sell cars or other goods, offer to deliver them to customers. This shows dedication to your brand and positions you as a competitor in the marketplace. Show your customers that you will optimize your products and services to make them happy and they will keep coming back.
Increase your online presence!
This one is huge. If you haven’t updated your website in years, are not posting regularly on social media and don’t send out a newsletter to your customers, then how on earth will your customers find you during a pandemic like this? You need to reassure them that your business is stronger than ever in these uncertain times. Even if it isn’t, you need to convey the message that it is! Show your customers that you are competitive in the market and that your brand offers peace of mind to its customers and you are an expert in your space. Offer free, engaging and informative content on your blog, social media and newsletters. Make sure your customers don’t forget about you by staying at the top of their minds and having a strong online presence during a pandemic like Covid19.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/how-to-use-social-media-to-grow-your-brand,"Success in the marketing arena depends on how effectively you leverage your brand across multiple channels including social media. Brands that fail to properly utilize social media platforms run the risk of being left behind. According to Hubspot, 49% of millennials and 54% of Generation Z rely on social media as their primary avenue for engaging with ad content. For your brand to grow and thrive, you've got to hit your social media feeds. Hard.
Unsure where to start? You're not alone. We've compiled a list of six strategies to help your brand realize its ultimate potential.
Listen to Your Customers
Brand awareness —and trust— relies heavily on inbound marketing in order to thrive. Inbound marketing is all about forming a two-way relationship with your customers in order to attract business and increase your company's profile. The more actively you court potential clients, the more diverse your role becomes. One minute you're a salesperson, the next a customer success manager. You may even find yourself providing a friendly, therapeutic ear.
Social media usage gives you a way to turn those interactions into a source of data that can help guide future marketing efforts.
Use Video Content
When it comes to attracting new customers, nothing beats the allure of bright and shiny, media-rich content. But you've got to employ a multi-modal approach on social media: text anchored by engaging video content.
Brands that turn visual media into high-quality content will see their growth increase exponentially. In fact, a staggering 63% of businesses rely on visual media to drive their social marketing efforts.
Raise Brand Awareness
Before customers can become clients, they have to know how to find your brand. Brand awareness is the entire point of social media marketing. Social feeds provide the perfect avenue to present your brand's identity to large tracts of untapped consumer demographics.
Establish Yourself as an Authority
Blogs are popular for a reason. Everyone including your local plumber has one embedded on their website. Text-based content not only helps you harness the power of Google's algorithm, increasing your company's visibility, but it establishes you as an authoritative voice in your space.
Always Use a Strong CTA
""Always be closing!"" If you don't ask for the customer's business, you leave your company's fortunes entirely up to luck. Every piece of content that you produce must have a clear and engaging call to action. Including a solid CTA will increase your brand's conversion rate by an exponential factor.
Offer Promotions and Discounts
Strong marketing includes knowing when to give back to the customer. Social media offers the perfect way to give ""exclusive"" discounts to customers that discover your products and services through social channels.
Regardless of the product or the service you offer, social media has emerged as an avenue of undeniable potential in terms of brand awareness. It is fun, engaging, and benefits both you and your clients. So what are you waiting for? Go get your company a TikTok account! And don't forget to follow Clairant Services for more marketing advice and trends!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/how-well-do-your-kids-know-their-grandparents,"This new life of social isolation has been difficult. Some of us haven’t seen extended family for more than 10 weeks. We don’t realize how hard it is to be away from family. Our parents and grandparents are important to us and it's good to check in with them. Even if they live far away, you should call them often. This is a fantastic time to get to know them better.
I recently lost 2 of my grandparents and this made me realize how much I wanted to learn about their lives but never got the chance to ask them. We always think we have so much time to learn about our heritage, family traditions and stories about our grandparents growing up, but often we don’t think of asking those questions until it's too late. Once they are gone that information is lost forever unless we find some way to document it. I currently have one grandparent left and I am committed to having my children get to know her despite us living in separate countries. I found this amazing opportunity to have all of the process handed to us to interview grandparents and ask all the right questions to capture a picture of their lives, traditions, heritage and to learn where we came from.
How well do you know your grandparents?

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/is-it-important-to-give-in-business-before-you-take,"The answer is Yes! VERY IMPORTANT! and here’s why.
I recently encountered an experience that inspired me to write on this topic.
I was taking a walk through town with the kids and the dog this weekend enjoying one of the hottest days of the year so far. We stopped by the local ice cream parlor and the kids and I walked the dog in the sun while hands got sticky and napkins around the cones got soaking wet by melting ice cream. We were enjoying the hot sun when we passed a cute italian restaurant with a couple chairs outside. A very friendly employee greeted us at the door as we walked by and asked
“How are you doing today?? Would you like to try a cannoli? They just came out of the oven and are super fresh! I just whipped up the cream. Wait here...I would love for you to try one!”
At this point I thought, wow how sweet! She didn’t even wait for me to answer. What great marketing, giving away samples as people walk by. But as I stood there waiting, I realized that if this WASN’T a sample, then what the heck am I going to do, because I only brought enough cash with me for ice cream, and not a cannoli that I really didn’t want in the first place. I had $2 in change with me and started to panic a little.
She finally came out (with the Chef!!) and on top of the To-Go container was a nice black leather bill fold containing the CHECK!
I said “Omigod I just realized that I only have $2 in cash on me as I only expected to buy ice cream on the walk”. They said “no problem… just sit here, eat the cannoli, and we can come to your house and collect payment. Do you want coffee too?” I said “NO thank you! I can walk home and bring it back.” The Chef said, “I really don't mind coming to your house. Where do you live?” Now getting a little frustrated, I stood up and said,
'not necessary. I will be right back, let's go kids. Thank you so much.""
I opened the bill fold and took out the check. One small cannoli was almost $10!
Then it came to mind as I walked back to the house that I am on a gluten free, dairy free diet! Hahahah! What just happened to me? I feel like I got robbed!
I ended up going home, cheating a little on my diet to taste it. Not the best cannoli but the cream in the middle was delicious! Presentation was beautiful. I found the phone number on the check and decided to call them with my credit card number. On the phone the chef picked up and said. “I really don’t mind coming there to get payment and that way you can just give me cash.” OMIGOD!! YOU CAN’T COME TO MY HOUSE!
So the point of this story is not about the chef inviting himself to my house to collect payment, rather, it’s about the employee manipulating me into purchasing something I really didn’t want! And making it sound like it was a sample by using the language “do you want to TRY a cannoli?” This sentence has a different meaning than “Would you like to order a cannoli for your walk?”
My first impression was, what a great business giving out free samples… I looked at the menu and considered ordering take out later for dinner. Or maybe next week. This ran through my mind because I thought they were so sweet to give out freebies during a time when the whole world is struggling. I would love to give back to them and support their business and order from them. I would have been a customer over and over again at that cute little Italian restaurant but for $10 in revenue probably $4 in profit, they lost that extra revenue by tricking me into buying that small pastry that I didn’t even want. Now I have a sour taste in my mouth after the experience, despite them being wonderful and sweet. I’m not sure that I will go back there now, to be honest.
So to all business owners out there, learn from the lesson in this story and realize that giving just a little can make a big difference in acquiring new customers, retaining existing customers, getting great referrals, and in turn, increasing your revenue.
Please share this story with your friends who are business owners.
Giving goes a long way.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/learn-how-to-grow-a-business-from-soul-centered-entrepreneurs,"As a soul-centered entrepreneur, I get how hard it can be to grow a business without sacrificing who you authentically are.
I remember when I first went out on my own when opening Clairant and taking the risk of potential instability. It was both scary and liberating and I haven't looked back since.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/my-story-as-an-entrepreneur-interview-with-a-linkedin-connection,"Recently a young, bright college student and aspiring entrepreneur, Leon Gogiqi, reached out to me on LinkedIn asking about my story. I thought I would share our conversation for other aspiring business owners to see if it may help anyone in their own journey.
I actually want to build a company of my own someday. So I'm curious, how did you start out Clairant Services and what steps did you [take] for it to grow?
It's a long story :) I'll make it short.
I spent years as a marketing executive at different companies and realized my passion was for the startup world. I had many opportunities come my way that I had to turn down because I had a corporate job and no time for anything else. I really wanted my cake and eat it too but the time wasn't right. I had fear of starting my own business for many reasons including, economic pressure and fear of not knowing enough. As the years progressed I educated myself with business books, paid attention to the best practices and mistakes of my leaders and finally took the leap and promised myself I would not be fearful. I didn't look back and I would move forward with the knowledge I had, keep learning and ask if I need help. So far so good! Clairant is growing and taking off at a rate faster than I had hoped for!
What would you say has been the hardest thing about making that jump into the startup world?
My biggest challenge right now is the feeling of not knowing what's ahead. When you rely on clients to stick around to pay your bills it's tough to stomach the fear of one or more leaving. Another challenge is that I am growing so fast that the work is starting to pile up. I am getting the business and I am also doing the work with some help of some amazing contractors right now, but soon I will need more help. So it's making that decision to hire someone when you don't necessarily have the steady revenue coming in but you know you will soon need it. I don't have any investment capital so I rely solely on my revenue which is a huge challenge. But I like the challenge and the desperation makes you work even harder. It's a rush and it's so much fun. It's also a great problem to have and a sign that Clairant is growing.
How did you decide marketing was the service you'd want to offer?
Because I love watching companies grow and succeed and I love understanding and watching my behavior affect that success. It's a rush to see your clients moving in the right direction and meeting all the goals they dreamed they would some day meet. Also the last decade of my life has been in marketing so I had the experience and knowledge to back me. It's also a very positive atmosphere which I need in my life and love being apart of.
Where was your first big breakthrough in terms of running a business? Like where you knew this company was going to last?
Well I think we never really know that it will last but you just keep doing the best you can do to run it efficiently and improve every day. But I think if I had to choose one moment it was when I got my second client. The first one was great but the second one proved that if I could get 2 then I could get 3 and 4 and so on. And so I kept at it, and used the same methods that previously brought me success and that kept getting me more clients.
Have you ever changed the methods for finding clients or has it been the same ever since?
I test campaigns on different channels all the time but so far networking is the most lucrative way to get new clients. Also referrals! Word of mouth is huge.
Is there anything specific you lead off with when getting new clients?
When I engage with people I am always more interested in learning about them than I am talking about myself. I always show an interest in their companies and I ask them a lot of questions to learn about their brand and their offerings. I am genuinely interested in how each individual company operates and promotes themselves. They later ask what I do and then it naturally goes from there. No need to sell anything... We are building relationships.
If you have any other questions about my journey as a new business owner or about marketing, please leave them in the comments below.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/playing-to-your-strengths,"Clarity and focus in marketing is often overlooked for the sake of “covering all your bases,” and while it is important to establish a reputation as a versatile company, it is more important to identify, market, and profit from your business’s greatest strengths. In order to gain momentum in your field of business, you need to have a marketing strategy that emphasizes exactly how and where your business takes up space in your industry. Here are three important steps you can take towards unlocking the value of your greatest strengths.
Step 1: Identify your Biggest Strengths
Your strengths are your competitive advantage in your field, so they shouldn’t be overlooked. They differentiate you from every other business doing similar work. Ask yourself a few simple questions if you’re having trouble identifying your strong points: What does my business have to offer? What skill/service/strategy do I rely on most? What makes my business stand out from the competition?
Step 2: Invest in Those Strengths
Figured out exactly what you want to focus on? Now it’s time to put that into action by investing in those strengths. Understanding the right way to improve upon and utilize your assets is the key to honing your talent. To get the most out of this, study the ins and outs of how these assets are applied to your work and how you can expand those applications. Now get familiar with and start utilizing the marketing language surrounding both the strength and how it is implemented in business. In doing so, your marketing efforts will better reach the target market most likely to benefit from your strengths.
Step 3: Stay Consistent and Persistent
Doubling down on what works best for you and your clientele is the secret to long-term success. Sticking with your skillset doesn’t box you in like some people assume; it gives you the opportunity to expand upon those skills. Rather than focusing your attention solely on how your competitors do business, get better and better at how you are doing business. Their strategies play to their own strengths, so copying those strategies puts you at a disadvantage because you’ll be trying to hone a skill that isn’t your best while also losing sight of the best qualities you have to offer.
Your biggest advantage in business is your own identity, so use it. Staying authentic in your pursuits by emphasizing your strong points will yield the greatest results. On top of that, focusing on your pre-existing skills and assets rather than striving to build a whole new set of skills makes your job easier, so you can do more (and better) work.
Play to your strengths and start marketing them today with Clairant.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/pros-cons-of-video-marketing,"For quite some time now, video has been steadily rising in popularity for online content. The number of websites that feature video content has been growing, and more businesses have begun to adopt it as a vital part of their marketing strategies. If you've been considering whether video marketing is right for your business, here are some pros and cons for you to consider.
Pros
Entertaining and Attention-Grabbing
Internet users are consuming more video content than ever before. For many people, watching a video is preferable to reading a blog post or consuming other types of content.
High Engagement and Conversion Rates
Adding a video, or in some situations, even just the word ""video"", increases conversion rates staggeringly. Video content gets the highest levels of engagement compared to other types of posts.
Limitless Creative Potential
The video format allows for businesses to convey so much information to the viewer, with complete flexibility of style, tone, and message.
Cons
Time-Consuming Production
It will take longer to plan and produce a video than it would to deliver other types of marketing content. Video production has to go through several stages before it's complete, which means results can take longer for companies that handle video production in-house.
Costly Overhead
Buying or renting video equipment can be expensive, and there are costs to consider beyond the day of shooting, such as scriptwriting and hiring the cast.
Ad-Skipping
Making marketing videos just won't cut it; what you need is great marketing videos. Otherwise, many people will choose to skip ads whenever possible. In order to get your content seen by the maximum number of people, you will need to create captivating content that they will want to watch to the end.
With a team of talented video creators that make videos too good to skip, and affordable pricing to avoid the overhead, Clairant can offer you all the pros of video marketing while taking on all the cons ourselves. With us, your company receives all the benefits with none of the hassle. Check out our $250 video marketing special offer, and call Clairant Services to start your 2021 strong with a simple but effective marketing plan!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/sharing-misery-during-tough-times,"This was my day at home so far:
8:25 - Giving kids 5 minute warning to start their homework
8:30 - Asking kids nicely to start homework
8:40 - Yelling at kids to start their homework
8:45 - Consoling kids after crying cuz they don’t understand their homework
8:50 - Separating kids after fighting about who gets to sit at what chair on the kitchen table
9:00 - Looking at clock to see how much time is left in the day
9:10 - kids asking if its break time yet
9:15 - 6 year old has melt down because he doesn’t want to rewrite a sentence that wasn’t legible
9:30 - 8 year old erases entire homework document accidentally and cries because of lost work
9:45 - looking at my own screen to see the same sentence I’ve been working on since 7am
10:00 - ...Thinking… Is it ok to have a glass of wine??
Here are some ideas to help pass the time and stay sane during social distancing:
We will get through this. These are challenging times but if you take breaks frequently, and keep busy this will be over before we know it. Have a routine in place. Get some fresh air, play games, bake, set up a marble track (video will be posted soon), clean out closets, junk drawers and the garage or basement. Make homemade pasta or bread. Paint! Tackle home improvement projects or get some yard work done. Give the kids some supplies to build forts out in the yard. Put your rubber boots on and get wet in rain. Find the deepest puddles to splash in. Go for a drive and let the kids do homework in the car. Get take-out and eat at a park. Watch movies, read books, learn something, watch videos and find a new hobby. Hike, walk, run, create a new at-home exercise routine. There are amazing videos online for workouts. Put on music really loud and dance around the house. Listen to music while you clean. Have zoom happy hours with your friends and family. Do whatever you can to stay busy, stay sane and get through this. We are all in this together! We can do it!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/signs-that-you-should-change-your-web-design,"Guest post by: Beth Williams
Just how important is website design? Some research indicates that a whopping 81 percent of internet visitors would think less of your business if it is not up-to-date. Another 39 percent of visitors would hesitate to use your product or service if your website is not user-friendly and current.
Apart from ensuring you have a modern web design, it is ideal that your site is updated every three years. Updated sites can generate more visitors and can dramatically impact your click-thru and conversion rates. Undeniably, your online presence is crucial if you want to grow your brand and increase your bottom line.
Glaring Signs You Need to Change Your Website Design
Changing your web design is no easy feat. However, if your site is no longer showing year-over-year growth, then a redesign is overdue. Below are other glaring signs you need to redesign your website.
1. Your website takes forever to load.
One of the typical indicators you need a new design is when your site takes too long to load. With online competition now more fierce than ever, people have infinite options available at their disposal. Most people don't have the patience to wait for slow pages to load completely. They would rather find other sites to visit.
Some studies indicate that most visitors are only willing to wait for 1.0 second for a page to load. If loading time goes over 2.0 seconds, visitors are likely to bounce off from your page. It might not be common knowledge, but Google considers page load speed a crucial factor when ranking pages.
In other words, if your site is slow, you will likely rank lower in the search engine result pages (SERPs). Use Google's Page Speed Insights test to assess how your site is performing in terms of speed. Be sure you also try it on mobile devices and desktops so you can check if it loads quickly on different devices.
If you can't do a website redesign right away, the following are some of the temporary remedies you can look into:
● Optimizing your images
● Avoiding too many redirects
● Optimizing your content and combining them into single scripts
● Making your components cacheable
2. You have a high bounce rate.
Bounce rate is defined as the percentage of single-page visitors to your website. Simply put, it is the percentage of visitors who visit your site and only visit the page they land on. Rather than exploring your site, they leave right away. Some of the common reasons visitors leave your website right away include:
● They did not find what they were looking for
● They did not find anything interesting
● They find your site too difficult to navigate
● They find your site too slow
A website redesign can dramatically improve your bounce rates and can help convince your visitors to stay around longer. If your bounce rate is 70 to 90 percent (throughout your site), consider content and copy updates. It is also a good idea to create a new website.
3. Your website no longer reflects your brand.
Your products, brand, and messaging can evolve over time. That said, your website has to keep up. The first impression you provide visitors can mean the difference between earning another bounce or another customer. As a general rule of thumb, ensure you have a well-designed site that aligns with your message.
If you claim your brand is on the leading edge, but your website is obsolete, there is a significant disconnect. In similar instances, a website redesign is recommended.
4. Your website is not responsive or mobile-friendly.
Mobile website traffic now makes up more than half of the web visits around the globe. If your site is not compatible with mobile devices, you will be missing out on all those potential visitors. However, even if your site is mobile-friendly because it is responsive, it won't always suffice.
It is crucial to keep in mind that mobile-first websites load faster, and search engines now gauge the search results from mobiles and not desktops. If you are creating a website for the first time, consider a mobile-first web design since user engagement on mobile devices is expected to increase over time.
5. Your website looks dated.
Old and obsolete sites are typically non-scrollable, have massive texts and one solid background color to boot. They're not only unsightly, they won't also do much for your conversions. Essentially, old websites often have too much text, no photos, no straightforward navigation, and old and stale content.
Nowadays, new websites tend to have minimal texts, large background images, and flat graphics. They are also often scrollable and include links to different pages throughout your site. To create a great first impression, your website should have:
Relevant content
For content to be relevant, it should be created with the target audience in mind. The value proposition should also be stated. It should clearly tell visitors and prospective customers what they stand to gain and what sets you apart from the competition.
Easy navigation
Visitors to your page should not have a hard time looking for your site's important pages. At all times, make sure visitors can navigate your site with ease. Ideally, you should have easy and straightforward navigation either along the sidebar or at the top of your site so you can quickly point visitors in the right direction.
Call-to-action
Your call-to-action tells visitors specifically what you want them to do so they can take immediate action on your site. Call-to-actions can vary from one brand or industry to another. Whatever your call-to-action may be, ensure you always test it, and you put thought into all aspects, including the placement, color, and text.
6. Your conversion rates are low.
Low conversion rates are one of the red flags of an under-performing website. There are various reasons for low conversions, and not all of them might merit a redesign. However, just like bounce rate, low conversion rates can be attributed to bad user experience.
If your conversion rate is exceptionally low, conduct a conversion analysis audit and set up Google goal tracking. Some of the things you should focus on include:
Behavior flow
You can find this in Google analytics. This will show you how people behave as they navigate through your site.
Landing pages
This is something you can also find in the behavior section of Google analytics. This will give you an insight into how well your landing pages are converting. At times, revamping your landing page can already do wonders.
Top exit pages
Top exit pages are the pages most visitors abandon. They are also the ones that should be given more attention during a redesign.
Wrap Up
If you notice any of the glaring signs mentioned above, website redesign should rank high in your list of priorities. If anything, ensure you don't overlook any of the warning signs. Otherwise, you won't be able to keep up with the competition. Also, if you have not done a redesign in 3 years or more, you are already overdue.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/speed-to-your-lead,"We all have this misconception that our sales people need to go through their leads the order in which they receive them. For example, If you have 200 leads in the queue the new ones go to the bottom. Lets try something different. Reverse the order. As the new ones come in, get to them right away! Your success will multiply for closing the leads and conversion rates will soar, especially if you are in an industry where there is a lot of competition. For example, real estate agents, lawyers, inspectors, landscapers, cleaning services, car lots, call centers etc. are all highly competitive industries to name a few. If you don’t respond to a form fill or a call within minutes, you will lose that opportunity as the consumer will go down the list of your competitors until they get a response.
The average speed to a lead is approximately 48 hours depending on the source of statistics and this seems ok years ago when online shopping was barely a “thing”. But according to a Velocify survey you are 391% more likely to close a lead if you respond within a minute of a web form submission. Yes! 391%! By waiting another minute you drop the likelihood of closing that lead by 120%! We are impulsive buyers in the age of ecommerce and when we want something, we want it now, or another shiny red ball will distract us. So as sales people, if we jump on the lead asap (within minutes) we will have a much higher chance of closing that sale than we will if we wait around.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/the-importance-of-virtual-networking-for-growing-your-business,"Want to grow your business? Network! (Yes! Even during these weird virtual Covid-19 times). Most of the networking events that took place in person half a year ago are still happening now. You just need to find the online versions of them. You can find all sorts of business networking opportunities on social media. Join virtual networking events that have great speakers and other business owners. There are so many opportunities that are mostly free. Most in person networking events that took place pre Covid-19 have created online versions of their events. Contact the organization that put it together and see what your options are. Here is an example of a networking event that I am speaking at this Wednesday called Relax Teams. It is free to join once a week on Wednesday mornings and they record the entire meeting and give you the content so that you can post your pitch or talks on your own networks! Win win! Here are some excellent reasons why you should continue to network online to grow your business.
Educate yourself
Not only does virtual networking bring in more clients, but it allows you to gain knowledge from other professionals inside and outside your industry. Conversations with other professionals help educate you and give you insight on what's going on with competitors and in other markets. Most virtual networking events offer featured speakers that educate the listeners. Ask about speaking opportunities for yourself. The organizers of these virtual networking events are usually looking for speakers to fill up their agendas in advance.
Partnership opportunities
Networking helps you establish partnerships with businesses that may enhance your product or service. For example if you own a coffee shop you may meet an owner of a local bakery who would be willing to sell your coffee in their store and would provide baked goods to sell in your coffee shop. This is an excellent way to open up new revenue streams and increase your profits for your business. Partnership opportunities are everywhere when you take advantage of networking.
Join your local chamber of commerce
The chamber is constantly offering events for local businesses to get together virtually and generate leads for your business. It is also reasonably priced. This not only allows you to support your local community and businesses but you become a family of businesses that all support each other and you will see your revenue grow directly from the people you meet and indirectly from referrals! The chamber will also help promote your content on social media and other news outlets with which they are affiliated.
I can honestly say that I have grown my business, so far, almost entirely through networking and referrals. This has continued since networking has transitioned to virtual meetings. Your networking will turn into new business and then referrals if your products or services live up to the expectations of your clients and customers. And word will spread like rapid fire. So find a networking event now and get some new business!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/the-new-look-of-email-marketing,"According to Statista, a market and consumer data company based in Germany, more than 4.3 billion people - over half the world's population - will be using email by 2023. With a staggering ROI of as much as $45 for every $1 spent, it's no secret that a well-oiled email marketing campaign can play a significant role in the success of your business. Over the last 12 months, COVID-19 has impacted nearly every facet of daily life, including email use. 78% of marketers reported an increase in email engagement since just before the pandemic. To ensure that your email marketing campaign can go the distance, check out the new rules to live by in 2021.
Know your customer base - and show them how well.
Segmentation can be intimidating since it involves parsing out information about only the products/services that are relevant to the specific audience you're trying to reach. However, as tempting as it is to tell your customers about everything you do, nearly 43% of consumers say they're likely to unsubscribe from your email blasts if they feel that the content isn't relevant to them. By adequately applying segmentation to your email marketing campaign, you can target a more precise subset of your customers to let them know what's new with the products or services they've shown an interest in in the past. When you provide them with information pertinent to their interests, both click-through and sales rates increase.
Let them go, but learn from their departure.
It may seem counterintuitive, but easy opt-out measures are a benefit to your business. It forces you to drop the rose-colored glasses and see your content through the consumers' eyes. Your audience won't opt out of high-quality content, so if you see an increase in unsubscribes, this is a valuable indicator to let you know that you've got some work to do.
Quality suggests quality.
Your products and services are high-quality; your content should look the part, too. In today's market, you've got to up the ante on your email graphics to attract a customer's attention and make them keep reading.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/the-top-5-reasons-to-start-using-video-marketing-today,"Video marketing is an excellent way to reach potential customers in a cost-effective manner. It also allows you to connect with your audience on a personal level.
In this article, we will discuss why video marketing is so powerful and how it can help you grow your business.
There are five main reasons why video marketing is such a powerful form of advertising. First, people love watching videos. They are more likely to watch a video than read text. Second, videos are easy to share. You can post them on social media sites, email lists, blogs, etc. Third, videos allow you to tell stories. People enjoy hearing stories, especially when they are told well. Video adds the visual aspect to a story that a podcast or text doesn’t offer. Fourth, videos are interactive. People respond better to visual stimuli than written ones. Finally, videos are searchable. If you use keywords in your titles and descriptions, then your videos will show up in search results. Let’s dive deeper into these five main reasons why video marketing should be a part of your marketing strategy.
Videos Are Easy to Create.
Creating a video isn’t as difficult as you might think. It takes just a few minutes to set up a simple video using free software like Windows Movie Maker or iMovie. You can use your iPhone or Android to shoot the video. Did you know that many Apple commercials are actually shot with the iPhone? The quality of video from new smartphones is phenomenal and the use of professional studios and expensive camera equipment is unnecessary these days. Once you have your video shot and edited you can upload it to YouTube or other video sharing websites.
They Can Be Easily Shared.
Videos are simple to share because they can easily be embedded into blogs, social media sites, and email messages. This means that people who see them will be able to click through to your website or blog easily where they can learn more about your brand, products and services. Create a strategy for sharing your videos. Choose a place where they will live, like your website, blog, or YouTube channel. Here are some of the best channels to promote your videos Incorporate them into your email marketing campaigns, your social media posts, and your blogs.

Another reason why video marketing is so powerful is that it has high engagement rates. People love watching videos. According to HubSpot, “Video is now the second largest driver of traffic to websites after search engine optimization (SEO).”
And Forbes says that more video content is uploaded to the internet in a month than TV has produced in the last 30 years. That's because people love videos. And they interact with them! Videos that are less than 2 minutes get the most engagement for length. And you are more likely to retain viewers of personal videos than non personal videos, according to Invideo.
They Help You Stand Out From Competitors.
Videos also help you stand out from competitors because they allow you to tell stories with images and sound. This helps people understand what you do better than text alone. But don’t forget to add captions on your videos. An unbelievable 92% of people watch videos with the sound off. This will also put you ahead of competitors knowing this simple statistic. Adding captions to your videos is simple and super effective.
The more good quality content you can share with your audience in the form of video will help prove you are experts in your industry and thought leaders. These videos will help gain trust in your brand and will turn into converted revenue down the road.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/the-top-logo-styles-of-2021,"Indeed, 2020 had its fair share of challenges, and most individuals had to take a break from their daily operations. However, 2021 presents new business opportunities, and taking a shot at a fresh start or revamping your current brand is a great idea. As you already know, innovative branding begins with creating a logo. For some inspiration on how you could revamp your company logo, here are the top logo styles of 2021.
1. Movement
The brand that sells its products on the web is the clear winner even as the world converges towards digitization. GIFs can help you achieve that because they offer a platform for involving social sites like Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, and Facebook in digital marketing.
2. Minimalism
Ever wondered how simple things speak volumes? Well, quite often, the simplest of the logo designs capture attention in the best way possible. So, if you want to drive online traffic towards your brand, consider leveraging a simple logo design. Also, note that besides conveying the message directly, minimalist logo designs are purpose-driven and practical.
3. Homemade
Connecting with clients intimately is possible through a handmade logo style because it delivers warmth, a personal touch, and authenticity. Restaurants and coffee shops are good examples of establishments fond of using the handmade style of logo designing.
4. Simplification
The ideal logo should stick in the minds of your audience, and that is achievable through a simple logo design. So, the next time you plan to revamp your logo, ensure it is distinctive, neat, unique, and clean. That way, such a logo will be easy to recognize and remember.
5. Negative Space
Most big brands follow the negative space logo design style. It is also one of the common logo design styles on social media pages and sites. Also, note that negative space is applicable when you have those with the penchant to discover the hidden, and it is pretty hypnotizing to the viewer as well.
6. Vintage
Creating a connection with memories and giving a nostalgic effect is the focus of the vintage style of logo designing. Additionally, beyond hitting the emotional quotient, vintage logos also convey a sense of authenticity, royalty, and trust.
7. Line Art
Today, the logo designing arena is experiencing an amalgam of the innovative thinking of new-age designers and the line art concept of logo designing. The reason is that line art logo designs are simple and laid back.
People are the focal point of any logo, and images that do not feel personable will not cut it in today's business environment. So, ensure the logo you choose from the options above captures the essence of your brand in the best way possible. If you need more information on logo trends of 2021, contact us today!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/the-value-of-digital-analytics,"As explained in last week’s blog, “Digital Metrics You Should Be Tracking,” these analytics can come in many different forms from many different channels - the most prominent of which include email campaigns, website activity, and social media engagement. Examining all this data serves a myriad of purposes all aimed at bettering your business and marketing plans. As a whole, digital analytics gives the most insight into these three main focus points:
Descriptive Analytics (i.e. Understanding and Measuring Success)
Trackable analytics takes the guesswork out of online marketing. Instead of contemplating the theoretical value and success rate of campaigns, you obtain definitive, hard numbers through your metrics. You’re able to see exactly which techniques got the most attention and positive feedback across all platforms and devices. Not only are you able to see what worked, you can see what worked for whom, and you gain valuable insight into the actions and motives of your target audience.
Predictive Analytics (i.e. Anticipating Customer Behavior)
Big data and analytics are excellent sources for identifying trends and customer behavior, determining ROI of particular strategies, and helping businesses make the best decisions for a variety of different business functions. Studying your analytics gives you a clear view as to how your target market is likely to respond to particular campaigns instead of just guessing then seeing what did and didn’t work.
Prescriptive Analytics (i.e. Making Decisions Based on Data)
You’re able to receive measurable results for every aspect of your marketing technique and use those results to inform any campaigns or strategies you make thereafter in order to accommodate the needs and trends that your audience has displayed, thus ensuring the best possible return on investment. Once your team starts the process of implementing change based on analytics, digital marketing becomes more effective, straightforward, and near effortless.
In today’s world, understanding digital analytics is absolutely necessary for establishing effective marketing strategies. No matter what industry your business specializes in, you need to pay attention not just to the kind of content you contribute to your online presence but how that content is received by your audience. To start getting the most value from your marketing efforts and strengthen your online presence, Clairant is here to help. Give us a call today!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/three-ways-to-improve-your-b2b-website,"When it comes to B2B sales, digital engagement has become just as important as in-person strategies. So, to make the most out of your leads, you need to be investing as much energy in your website as possible. Building a seamless view of your company to convey to customers can mean the difference between making a sale or not, so rethinking and redesigning your site for the sake of efficiency and effectiveness is always a good idea. With that in mind, here are three steps you can take to optimize your B2B website.
1. Make visitors feel like a part of the conversation
Nobody wants conversations to be one sided and to be constantly talked over. The same can be said for digital engagement. Customers appreciate the opportunity to express themselves, so making sure your site isn’t all about your company and your company only makes customers feel more welcome and open to connecting with your business.
2. Speak in terms your target audience is familiar with
Use customer-centric language and focus on who your customers are and what their needs are, not just about who you are and what you can do. Take the time to understand the specific business objectives customers are trying to achieve, and implement language familiar to people with those goals. Don’t expect customers to try and translate whatever you write into terms they’ll understand; meet them at their level.
3. Help your customers get what they want from your site
Identify specific tasks that your customers come to your website to complete and make sure those goals are not only achievable but easy to navigate. Give your customers the tools they expect - and more, if you can - so they see your company as dependable, thorough, and convenient. Find inventive ways to become your customers’ preferred channel for whatever your website has to offer, whether that be educational purposes, industry resources, etc.
Your goal is to make online engagement as easy for your customers as possible, so they’re more willing to do business with you. So, keep in mind your customers’ identities, vantage points, and needs along every step of building and maintaining your B2B website, rather than just those of your businesses. For guidance, web design, and upkeep of your site, Clairant is always here to help. Give us a call today to start perfecting your B2B website.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/tips-for-restaurants-finding-more-customers-during-covid,"After a few months of restaurants being prohibited to allow patrons to “dine in”, most have been offering delivery or curb side pick up. These restaurants are still open for business but it looks like 90% of them have closed even though they are open. Here’s the deal. People are out walking more than ever now. The weather is turning and we are out and about, many of us dying to eat restaurant food. Just because people can’t sit inside your restaurant to eat doesn’t mean they won’t buy from you. Here are some tips on what restaurants should be doing NOW to get more business during the pandemic.
Put your Menu outside on a LARGE SIGN
I have passed several restaurants who are open for business but they have no menu posted on their door or on a sign. If they had, I most likely would have bought take-out from them that day. Maybe I didn’t have a mask in my pocket to go in, or maybe I didn't have my phone on me to search for them online or call them. If you have a lot of foot traffic outside your restaurant you will gain more customers by having your menu front and center as people walk by. Get a good quality large A-Frame sign for your menu that sits on the sidewalk and is clearly visible to people walking by. Make sure to put a call to action on the sign such as a phone number to order or an app to download etc.
Balloons
Balloons get people’s attention. Purchase a $20 helium tank and fill up balloons every day when you open. Put them near your doors and windows of your restaurants and where your menu is posted to attract people. Kids love balloons and they will pull their parents to see them. This will give you more exposure and you’ll gain more customers because of it.
If allowed, put tables outside 6 feet away
When people see a patio they understand that your business is probably open, they are inclined to take a rest and they will most likely feel obligated to buy something from you if they do. Outdoor tables attract customers especially during this time when most streets are ghost towns from a business perspective. In the town where I live, normally every door is open, displays of merchandise are moved to the sidewalks, music is playing and foot traffic is hugely increased to these businesses. Right now no one is doing that. So be the first on your street to put some tables on the sidewalk and stand out!
Keep your door wide open
Some people go walking and don’t always bring their phones. (I know that sounds crazy but it's true!) They may pass a restaurant that interests them but can’t call in. If your door is open the customer can get your attention at the doorway. Many businesses during this time have missed out on revenue just from myself because their doors were not open. I don’t always have a mask in my pocket when walking or running but sometimes something may catch my eye that I want to buy. I can’t open the door and go in without a mask but if the door was open and the staff was accessible, I would have made the purchase. So keep it open and increase your revenue!
Play outdoor music
People love music! Especially during these dark times when most streets don’t have a lot of action. Be the first on your street to offer music to the foot traffic outside your door. People are drawn to music and will flock around the area to enjoy a few songs. This will draw attention to your brand, your store front and your menu! So pump up the outdoor tunes and draw more customers to your restaurant.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/tips-for-text-accessibility-visual-optimization,"When it comes to website content, there are nearly countless aspects and mediums to choose from: videos, photos, graphics, infographics, datasheets - you name it! But let’s not forget the absolute cornerstone of website content: plain text. As such, the way in which you display text is one thing you absolutely must not take lightly, for the sake of making your website both readable and effective. Here are our top tips on the matter:
1. Use appropriate font sizes and styles
For visually impaired website visitors, this is the most important thing you can do to ensure that nobody has a difficult time browsing your site. Moreover, appropriate styling and sizing is also key to providing visually pleasing content. Typically, it’s best to use at least 16px or 12pt font and avoid distracting or indistinguishable fonts.
2. Utilize headings and subheadings
For quick navigation and understanding, use headings and subheadings. Imagine you’re writing an outline or plotting the framework for what you want to say, and let that drive your wording and topic choices, even if you’re aiming for catchy headlines or quotes rather than titles.
3. Keep things short and simple
Very few people are willing to scroll through several paragraphs of text, and even fewer prefer to. So, keep your paragraphs brief and stick to the most effective talking points, so as to keep your readers’ attention and interest.
4. Condense with bullet points & lists
Keeping in mind the lesson from the last tip (how nobody wants to read a thousand word essay on your webpage), an easy way to keep things simple is to use lists and bullet points to break your content down visually for those looking to skim rather than read closely.
5. Mix things up with graphics
Staring at a page only text can be draining on the eyes and down right boring. Keep your audience invested by mixing in photos, graphics, videos, and the like for a diverse viewing experience.
Next time you set up a new page on your company website or update an existing one, keep these tips in mind. We guarantee they’ll make a difference. To further optimize your site, or rebrand it altogether for a new and improved online presence, try Clairant. We’re here to help your brand make the best impression possible. Give us a call today!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/top-5-social-media-problems-setting-you-back,"Marketing is not what it used to be before the internet and social media. Social media have become one of the most powerful marketing tools any company can use. Gone are the days when we shunned social media as a time-wasting pastime.
In the social media marketing world, marketing on social platforms is a must-have for any brand, and the facts prove it. Every day, 45% of the global population devotes over two hours to social media, and almost 75% of marketers believe in the effectiveness of social media. However, some challenges of the social media market plague companies that use social media, such as:
#1 - Platform Identification
Businesses fail in their selection of the platforms they should leverage. Just because you heard that Instagram is the ideal platform does not mean you should automatically market it. Most marketers do not research their target audience and which platform they spend most of their time on.
#2 - Understanding Target Audience
Some brands do excellent business in brick-and-mortar stores but fall flat on their faces on the social media end. The difference here is that your clients come to you in a physical store, but you have to seek out your customers on social media. Measuring brand awareness just got easier with social media!
Marketers sometimes create content without a target audience—a big mistake. Your content might be all that and then some, but it is just content if you don't tailor it for a specific audience. It might garner a few likes and comments here and there, but it is not up to its full potential. Every business has a type or type of audience. Master yours, know your market and create content accordingly.
#3 - Trouble Expanding to New Platforms
When a new platform emerges, most businesses are slow on the uptake. If the new platform is where your target audience has shifted to, pack up your bags and follow them there! It's that simple!
#4 - Creating Lead Generating Content
Generating content ideas and interactive media posts that generate leads for social media is tricky for most businesses. It is challenging to drive an audience from social media platforms to click on a dedicated landing page and encourage media sharing.
#5 - Lack of Content Ideas
Everybody struggles with creativity blocks in social media content creation. When your business runs out of ideas for content, you start posting erratically and lose your audience. Nobody wants to follow a page with one great idea today, and none in two weeks. Consistency and brand presence is vital. Source your content in advance to avoid these challenges.
If you need help mastering social media marketing, give Clariant a buzz, we are never too busy to listen! We have just the solution, so give us a call today and help you solve all your problems with social media marketing.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/top-5-tips-for-marketing-your-small-business-in-2021,"2020 was a tough year for many small business owners. However, there is no challenge that can't be overcome with the right marketing strategy. At Clairant, we are always buzzing with ideas to enhance the success of your business. Here are our top five best tips for reaching customers in 2021.
1. Keep Your Website Updated
Don't overlook the importance of having a website! It's the fastest way for customers to find you, and it should be visually appealing and easy to navigate. However, don't make the mistake of thinking that once you've done this, you're finished. It's important to keep updating it with new, fresh content.
2. Utilize Social Media Platforms
There are so many forms of social media these days! This is a great thing because it gives potential customers more ways to discover your business and connect with you. Maintain a presence on multiple platforms, and post consistently.
3. Create and Manage a Google Business Listing
Google is the most popular search engine in the world, so when people are looking for your business, chances are good the first thing they do will be a Google search. By managing your business listing on Google you get to control what people see when they search for you. This is important, and it's also free, so don't skip it!
4. Start a Lead Nurturing Campaign
Many small businesses overlook lead nurturing, which is a shame because it's critical for increasing revenue. Use email marketing to conduct a lead nurturing campaign. First, find a user-friendly email marketing platform that appeals to you, such as Constant Content, or HubSpot. Start sending out emails that entertain and educate while subtly promoting your products or services.
5. Don't Forget to Follow Up
This step is so essential for increasing your return on investment. No matter what method you use to generate leads, you always have to follow up with them, so be sure to make a plan with your sales staff.
If you want to start the new year off strong with a simple but effective marketing plan, then contact us for a free consultation. Clairant offers completely customized packages for any budget, and we're experts in startup marketing. Call us at 973-507-6980, we'd love to chat with you!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/user-experience-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-care,"Here's something not many people know: lurking beneath the surface of everything they do is something known as user experience (UX). If you are like most people, it's something you probably never considered. However, if you use the internet, UX is important to you.
Essentially, UX covers the how, when, what, where, and why someone uses a service or product. User experience is how users feel when interacting with something, including web design. Some also liken UX to customer service since it involves ensuring customers' needs are met as seamlessly as possible.
There is more to creating a great user experience than meets the eye, and it goes beyond creating an aesthetically pleasing website with responsive web design and eCommerce chatbots. UX is all about pleasing the end-users. To achieve this objective, a clear understanding of the needs and priorities of website visitors is required.
User Experience: Why It Matters
If you want to fully appreciate the importance of user experience, let us examine some interesting statistics:
Not convinced? The experience of some of the leading brands in the world should give you a clearer insight into the importance of UX.
User Experience: Why You Should Care
When UX is neglected, some of the most crucial aspects of the business can be compromised, including customer loyalty, sales, and brand reputation.
Customer Loyalty
Over 52% of website visitors revealed they stopped engaging with a brand after a disappointing experience. What's even more alarming is that over 79% of visitors that are not satisfied with the information they are getting from a website will typically visit competitors.
This is not surprising as visitors don't like staying long on websites that don't have the information they want. For those that struggle to retain current customers or entice new prospects, improving user experience is one of the first elements they should look into and improve.
Sales
If the sole purpose of your website is to generate online sales, UX is one element that should rank high in your list of priorities. It is crucial to remember that slow loading websites have resulted in $2.6 billion in lost sales yearly.
Over 60% of consumers consider lack of information, a small screen, and slow connection as some of the reasons that prevent them from patronizing a product or service. If you are not happy with your website's conversion rate, the likely culprit is poor user experience.
Brand Reputation
When your website is not visually appealing, consumers and visitors are likely to take it against your brand. This might not be common knowledge, but at least 94% of first impressions are design-related. Also, 60% of visitors revealed they wouldn't recommend poorly designed sites to others. Undoubtedly, the impact of UX on brand reputation is huge.
Ways to Improve User Experience
Surprisingly, there are many ways you can improve UX. If you want to improve user experience, the following tips should get your efforts off to a good start:
Audit your website's flow.
Check your site's structure or sitemap. Assess if it can help your visitors quickly and effortlessly find what they want. If the process involves multiple steps before visitors find what they are looking for, consider redesigning your website's structure and flow.
It would also be ideal to use a user testing tool to get a better insight into the site paths considered simple and complicated by visitors. Aside from good site structure, it is also recommended that you make headings work in your favor.
Test your website.
User testing is one of the most effective ways you can assess if your website provides a superb user experience. Fortunately, there is no shortage of helpful and powerful tools you can use nowadays to test various aspects of your website. Some tools are also designed to help you get an insight into how visitors view your website's design, content, and functionality.
Final Thoughts
The importance of UX cannot be overemphasized. Without UX, a website will be challenging to navigate and a pain to use. If you want to stay competitive and take your brand and business to the next level, UX is something you cannot afford to overlook.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/virtual-networking-staying-connected-in-a-remote-world,"Written By Drew Deraney
Networking is essential for your career, and the ability to forge new relationships is crucial to the success of any business. Building professional relationships can make the difference between staying professionally stagnant and climbing the career ladder to success. If you’re not networking, you’re not growing your career. It’s that simple.
Utilizing new skills to gain potential clients during the pandemic become more of a necessity than an option, and despite months of social distancing finally coming to an end, face-to-face networking is still taking a major hit.
As we slowly begin to embrace limited attendance, in-person networking opportunities, the days of meeting others at industry events and conferences, exchanging business cards, and shaking hands feel mostly still on hold – but there are ways to expand network connections and develop solid professional relationships virtually.
Although it may seem difficult, it’s not impossible. However, to help grow your business by networking virtually, your approach and attitude may need to change to embrace an evolving social landscape. The key to successful networking is to get to know people, have genuine conversations, and provide value. The good news is that a lot of these principles still hold true while networking virtually — but for many (myself included!) the transition has been challenging.
Here are some simple tips that I’ve found helpful along the way.
Get Comfortable With New Technology
It doesn’t matter what platform you use – though Zoom, Skype, and WebEx are among the most popular. I’ve found that giving yourself enough time to work through any kinks before the meeting is slated to begin is imperative to a successful virtual connection. Run a test of your setup before each virtual networking opportunity to ensure that your audio and video outputs are good and avoid any potential technical issues or annoying glitches by checking that the internet connection is stable.
Attend Virtual Events
Having quickly adapted to our new socially distanced reality, many conferences and other similar events have already taken a virtual approach to networking. With physical location no longer a barrier, we can even re-think geographic boundaries. Events are now available worldwide, attracting a wider range of participants who are ready to network online. With easy sign-ups and interactive livestreams, connecting with other guests has never been easier. This is also true of expanding your networking circle. If you’re part of group like BNI, you have access to a global network of professionals such as yourself. You’re not confined to your regional limitations. There is no time like the present to make new connections and learn more from a diverse cast of likeminded businesspeople.
Prepare Like You Would An In-person Networking Event
Preparation is a key component of virtual networking. Planning questions or an agenda beforehand will not only show professionalism but help direct the conversation topics and keep all participants on-track. If I am attending a networking event at a chamber, I will look at the list of attendees and decide who I want to meet. This preparedness will help keep that connection with your contact, resulting in both parties getting the most value out of the experience.
Use LinkedIn To Your Advantage
As the saying goes: “It’s not what you know—it’s who you know.”
Every entrepreneur or business owner knows the power of a strong professional network. The right connections can offer access to exciting new opportunities, help to grow your company, introduce you to new leads and so much more. A strong network is essential to take your business to the next level. LinkedIn is a great platform for expanding your network, and it’s only becoming more comprehensive. Posting regularly scheduled, thoughtful content establishes you as an expert in your industry, and allows you to engage with your network at the same time. Likewise, there are numerous groups for professionals on the platform to connect with and interact in meaningful discussions. If the kind of group you’re looking for doesn’t exist yet, make it!
Follow up
If you told someone you would get in touch with them or promised to introduce someone to a person you know, take the time to do it. It often only takes minutes to shoot off an email and keep the relationship alive. If you do not hear back from a person with whom you want to network, a follow-up is fine, but remember: if you try many times in quick succession, you could quickly be perceived as an annoyance!
Practice Your Writing
While remote networking is great on paper, it’s not without its challenges, and not everyone you connect with will be readily accessible for video chats. These potential contacts will likely prefer to message back and forth to fit their schedule. Honing your writing skills to ensure a professional tone will reflect your attention and appreciation when communicating — especially during early interactions — as that crucial first impression is so important. I recommend sending a thank-you message to anyone you do connect with, as this simple but memorable gesture often goes a long way.
If you got into business before the pandemic, you may be struggling now with how to network. That is completely understandable; we have all had to adjust. However, take advantage of the technology at your disposal, and make the new landscape work for you. I’ve had a lot of success with this in my new role as a franchise owner, and that’s just in my first year. The nice thing about networks, is that if you nourish them, they will keep growing.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/vital-systems-for-growing-small-businesses,"Guest Post by Derek Goodman from Inbizability.com
Small business owners face unique challenges when their companies grow beyond their original handful of members to a company with several employees. At this point, owners are faced with decisions about human resources, payroll systems, insurance, workplace safety, and other areas of federal compliance. Although growth, in many ways, represents success, it also poses challenges that can be expensive or labor-intensive. To help you navigate the landscape, Clairant Services shares the following guidance.
1. Human Resources
Human resources departments focus on finding great people to work for the company and
creating an organizational system that promotes strength within the company. To this end, there are a few requirements:
It is vital that business owners designate an individual or a team to handle human resources.
Otherwise, the company could fall out of compliance with federal regulations, such as Equal
Employment Opportunity laws. Joining the local chamber of commerce is one way for small
business owners to learn more and stay on top of challenges associated with growth.
Experienced peers in the local community can be a wealth of knowledge and support.
2. Payroll Systems
A well-organized payroll system is another crucial factor in healthy growth. Paying your
employees on time with accurate paychecks boost productivity and reliability among employees.
It helps the company remain compliant with local and federal guidelines. The employees who
supervise payroll handle scheduling and time logs, complete invoices and paychecks, and a lot of other related tasks. With limited staff, small business owners could look for an automated payroll system with templates that streamline these processes. It is also worth noting that without a good payroll system, businesses could develop negative reputations among potential employees.
3. Marketing Solutions
A strong marketing strategy is critical for the growth and success of your business. This is how you tell the world about your venture and what you have to offer, and it’s how you engage with current customers and attract new ones. If you lack marketing savvy, it’s best to work with an agency like Clairant Services, which specializes in everything from fractional CMO services, brand guides, website design to social media management, email marketing, blogs, videos and more. They can help you develop a strategy that boosts brand awareness and enhances your online presence.
As you let your agency take the lead in implementing your marketing efforts, there are some
DIY options you can use to supplement their work. This can be in the form of handcrafted social media posts or a captivating banner that works for your website and your preferred social media platforms. Apps like Adobe Spark can make this a fun exercise with professional-grade results your marketing pro would be proud of. This app offers an online banner maker with templates you can customize as well as design features like images, graphics and a variety of fonts. Just be sure what you create lines up with the elements your agency is using in your campaign.
4. Insurance and Benefits
With fewer than 50 employees, businesses are not required to offer health insurance. However, some small business owners choose to provide insurance and other types of benefits to attract talented employees. Additional benefits beyond insurance include paid sick time, paid time off, paid holidays and retirement plans. Note, there are some distinctions that affect which
employees are eligible for benefits:
● Number of work hours daily and weekly
● Location of physical business and employees
● Length of employment with the company
● Job titles and description
There are several classifications that cannot be used to decide whether employees get
insurance and other benefits. These include color, race, religion, gender, health, age, and
disability. As small businesses approach the legal need to provide insurance, owners can reach out to the government for more information.
5. Workplace Safety
Regardless of the type of business, workplaces must be in compliance with regulations
established by the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration. As small business
owners move into this territory, they must start by making employees aware of potential
dangers. According to risk assessment professionals, this begins with discussing the risks of
falls, being struck by something, electrocution, and getting stuck between multiple objects.
OSHA provides information and guides specifically for small business owners. Another good
source of information is the insurance company that provides commercial coverage against
accidents, damages, and other financial losses.
Small businesses are affected by many unique challenges as they grow, but understanding how to tackle those changes can set the stage for future success and expansion. With solid HR, payroll, marketing, insurance, and workplace safety systems in place, small business owners set the stage for a strong future.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/ways-to-generate-leads-on-social-media,"The Essentials Of Social Media Marketing
These days, your “brand” is everything.
The power of social media marketing is astounding. It is the best way to build your brand and your customer base. This all begins with a branded content strategy.
A true social media strategy comes down to three things:
So how can you use social media and create a strategy to build your startup? Clairant Services, the experts in marketing for startups, explains:
Customer Insights Marketing
“The Best Vision is Insight”- Malcolm S Forbes.
Customer insights marketing helps you to build a solid base of customers for your startup. To do this, you need to understand your future customers' behaviors and needs.
Customer insights interpret the current trends in your customer’s behavior. By using social media tools, you can uncover their underlying preferences. You can discover their existing frustrations. You can find out their clear wants and needs.
This information will help you to increase your startup’s relevance with your customers and improve your product or service.
Steps to Strong Social Media
Social media marketing for startups involves many steps, and a diligent follow up. Solid content is key.
How has social media marketing changed business lead generation?
Top level social media content strives for awareness engagement conversion. This involves researching your customers needs, establishing a relationship where you clearly show that you can beat the competitor at meeting their needs, and using engagement to generate loyalty with existing (and new) customers.
How to reach out to influencers?
Reaching out to a social media influencer is a great way to generate leads. It’s actually quite simple. The most effective way to reach an influencer is to send a direct social media message, or you can email directly to them that simply asks if they’d like to collaborate with your brand. Keep it simply and get straight to the point.
You can also use tools on Amazon that allows an influencer to reach out directly to you to show if they are interested in collaborating.
Social Media Marketing Rules
Beyond just building leads - there is a social media etiquette of sorts. This helps you keep your followers.
Essentially, you want your brand to model the kinds of behavior that you feel your company represents. Also, set an example of what you’d like from your social follower community.
“Follow the 3 E’s: Engage, Educate, and Escalate”- Crains Detroit
In addition to this, you should set specific goals of engagement:
As with anything in life, mistakes do happen. If you find that you’ve made an error in a post, simply and swiftly correct it. Damage control involves fast and honest action. Customers are forgiving.
Social Media Marketing Is Extremely Effective
In 2022, social media is woven into the fabric of who we are. More than 50% of all consumers engage with social media before making a purchase.
Why is social media so attractive for consumers?
Consumers can quickly make an easy, informed decision with minimal effort on their part.
Customers are greatly influenced by social media and influencers, so it is critical that a startup company keeps up! To do so, check out Clairant's social media services and get connected today!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/what-are-dark-posts-you-ask,"Gary V, a well-known marketer and successful business owner does a great job promoting the use of dark posts in this short video. 4 years ago he predicted that dark posts would be the new best marketing tool and guess what? He was right!
What are dark posts? Dark posts are the sponsored ads on social platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Instagram. Dark posts are different from organic posts or boosted posts because they do not show up on your feed or your followers feeds. They are sponsored ads that resemble posts but are only visible on the feeds of the targeted market you want them to reach. Dark posts are cheap and EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE. Targeted ads are great for demographics like age, geographic location and gender. But dark posts go even more in depth to target your ideal customers. You can filter almost anything and Facebook collects a whole lot of data on its members.
Each platform has its own name for dark posts:
Facebook: Unpublished post
Twitter: Promoted-only tweets
LinkedIn: Direct sponsored content
Instagram: Unpublished page post
Over 90% of businesses use Facebook ads. That’s a lot! They must work!
Across industries you see about a 0.9% click-through-rate. And from that if the ad is enticing enough a 24% conversion rate! This is huge compared to other channels of lead generation.
So try dark posts for a change and see if they work for your business.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/what-are-the-steps-you-go-through-when-helping-a-client-rebrand-their-business,"1/26/2021
What does the rebranding process look like and how long does it usually take? What's a reasonable price to pay for a rebrand?
Branding or rebranding can be a simple task or a daunting one. It depends on the size of company and the decision makers. At Clairant we make it easy. We sit down with the stakeholders and ask a series of questions about the current branding and what's wrong with it. Who is your target audience now and who should be the target audience after the new branding. We then ask where the team wants to be from a branding perspective. We research different options with the team and pull in external focus groups representing the target market on the emotions behind, colors, tag lines, messaging and logo design. We pay attention to the feelings evoked by reading a line of text or staring at a logo representing the brand in all different colors and designs. We have experienced graphic designers that are with you throughout the entire process. We make the process fun and exciting.
We can do as little as tagline, logo and color rebranding, and go as far as website redesign, complete messaging overhaul for marketing material in digital and print. We can redesign tractor trailers and billboards, or recreate a boilerplate. Our packages range from $1000 to $6600 depending on the size of the project. It can be more depending on the extent of the project.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/what-does-a-good-elevator-pitch-look-like,"With attention spans in humans these days, and distractions all over the place, we are inclined to make judgements about people, products and services within seconds of being introduced to different brands. Elevator pitches must be short and to the point while drawing in the potential customer to want to learn more. But despite the importance of elevator pitches, you’d be surprised how many companies just don’t have a consistent pitch!
What components are involved in a good elevator pitch? As you can see from the elevator pitch examples below, when creating a pitch you want to make sure to start with the pain points or challenges that potential customers are facing before they come across your product. That should then lead into a short and concise description of your product or service that will ultimately solve the issue the customer is facing. So start constructing yours and keep it under 30 seconds. Share it with your staff and make sure each member of your team can recite it naturally and consistently.
Here are a couple great examples of effective elevator pitches:
Air BnB:
Most tourists booking online care about price- and hotels are one of the highest costs for when traveling. On the other hand, platforms like Couchsurfing have proven that over half a million people are willing to lend their couches or spare bedrooms. We have created a platform that connects travelers with locals, letting them rent our rooms, or even entire places. Travelers save money, and locals can monetize their empty rooms- we just take a 10% commission. How does that sound?
WeWork
There are 40MM independent workers in the US: consultants, freelancers, and small business owners. Solving office space is tough and expensive, especially in cities like New York. We created the concept of space as a service. We have 20 locations in the city- where people can rent a desk or an office without any of the complications of a traditional lease, effectively saving at least 25% of the cost. They get access to a shared front desk, mailroom, and a community of like-minded people.
Slack
The average office worker receives 304 emails per week. They also attend an average of 62 monthly meetings, half of which they consider 'wasted time'. Slack was made to make work more efficient. It organizes conversations by channels and drastically reduces the need for emails or meetings. It's integrated with 100s of productivity tools like Google Docs, Calendars, Email, Dropbox, Zoom... so you can receive automatic notifications and take action without leaving the interface.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/what-is-e-a-t-in-marketing-and-why-is-it-important,"When it comes to your website, great analytics are everything, and the key to achieving great results is producing great content. Where do you start when it comes to writing copy for your site that will get the attention of your target audience and put your site on the map? Well, that’s where E-A-T comes in. Ever wonder ‘why does my google ranking keep changing?’ The answer may be E-A-T. Let’s take a look at what that means for your business and your site.
What is E-A-T?
Simply put, E-A-T is an acronym that indicates the 3 most important qualities of your brand that your website needs to convey to accomplish your goals. It’s what can make the difference between converting leads or not and is exactly how to attract customers online. Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness.
Why is it important for your website?
E - Expertise
Demonstrating the skills, knowledge, and market awareness your company brings to the table gets visitors interested in working with you and/or learning from you. Whatever the goal of your website is - whether it be converting leads, educating others in your field, or just boosting brand visibility- audiences are looking for sources with the most evident expertise.
A - Authoritativeness
Knowing your stuff is one thing, but putting that into practice can only get results if you establish yourself as a leader in your industry. Engaging web design is a good way to portray notoriety. Audiences respond to brand authority, so establishing a sense of credibility and awareness makes a big difference.
T - Trustworthiness
You want your site to be a place that visitors come back to again and again, so showing them that you are a source that can be trusted will lead to increased page views. You need the content, tone, post consistency, and overall feel of your site to give off the notion that your audience can rely on you.
As you can tell, E-A-T determines websites’ value to site visitors, and can even improve Google My Business ranking. It’s the key to great brand reputation management and the reason someone would choose your website over another. Good E-A-T can improve your site’s popularity and your brand’s online visibility and reputation. So, make your best effort to strive for those qualities by hiring Clairant to do the work for you. Our busy bees know exactly how to make your website stand out. Give us a call today.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/what-is-lead-nurturing-and-how-do-you-set-up-the-best-lead-nurturing-strategy,"Most companies are so excited about bringing in leads but then they leave them sitting in a list and do nothing with them. Bringing in leads is great but if you don’t convert those leads into revenue you will never see an ROI. What is your lead nurturing strategy?
Here are some statistics. What would you guess the average number of times a salesperson follows up on a lead? The statistics say that 50% of all sales people give up on the first contact. 65% give up after two attempts and 80% give up after three shots.
Do you know how many attempts it takes before the average lead will turn into a customer? 12!
This is why lead nurturing is extremely important!
So how do we nurture our leads and implement lead nurturing best practices? Here are some tips.
First put them on a twice a week call/email campaign where a salesperson/relationship builder will call the lead and leave a message if there is no answer. Immediately follow up with an email telling them you called. Be personable! Tell them where you met them and talk about current events or ask them about their family if you can. Do this for the first month. If you have no response, put them on a one year long term lead nurturing campaign where you email them at least once a month and call them on the phone once a quarter. Create engaging content that will speak to your audience.
What type of content should you offer them?
At any given time there are only about 3% of ppl who are extremely interested in your product or service and ready to buy. 7% are very open to buying and 30% are interested but just not now.
For the other section of the pie you have your 30% who are not interested and another 30% who wouldn’t take it even if it were free.
(Statistics courtesy of Allan Dibs The 1-Page Marketing Plan)
The point of sharing these statistics with you is to help you shape your messaging to speak to each of these audiences, especially the first 40%.
So set up a newsletter that captures the attention of the leads ready to buy and the ones that aren’t quite ready.
Perhaps an offer is suitable for the 10% who are super interested in your product or service. Give them a 2 for 1 deal or 10% off with a promo code etc. For the other 30% who are not yet ready to pull the trigger, give them valuable information that will show them you know your stuff and will build trust in your brand. When they are ready to buy, they will eventually choose you.
Reach out to your leads immediately. On your nurturing campaign, move the ones that respond and become customers to a new list of current customers. Send them engaging content on a separate campaign that focuses on up-selling and cross selling.
So tell us…. What does your company do with your leads? Tell us below.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/what-is-seo-why-is-it-important,"In the increasingly competitive business environment, entrepreneurs constantly adapt their marketing strategies to garner more significant market shares and outdo the competition. One of the most recent and effective techniques is Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Read on to find out what SEO is, what it entails, and everything in between.
What exactly is SEO?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is a marketing technique entrepreneurs use to increase meaningful traffic to their website and increase visitor conversion rates. By optimizing your content, you increase the chances of prospecting customers taking action and doing what you want them to do, say, request an invoice from you.
What are the basic elements of SEO?
Your typical search engine, such as Google, uses algorithms to collect information from web pages and categorize websites based on this information. Search engines then analyze websites further and use many other factors to determine how websites rank on the search query. Here are the most common elements of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) you should know...
1. Keywords
Prospective clients are likely to type certain keywords when searching for stuff through their search engines. You can identify these words and use them in your content. Use keywords to get your website high rankings by blending them naturally into your titles, subtitles, URLs, and paragraphs.
2. Content
Web content is what you intend potential customers to see on your webpage. Good content is the key to appealing to prospects. It could be a description of your products, a 'how to' blog post, a video, or even a podcast. To optimize your content for search engines, make it exciting, shareable, readable, and relevant.
3. Off-page SEO
You can also improve your website's ranking in search engines through off-page SEO. Off-page SEO includes actions taken outside your website to improve its ranking. The best Off-page SEO technique is backlinking. Quality backlinks to your site tell search engines that it is valuable earning your high rankings.
4. Search Engine Marketing (SEM)
SEO also goes beyond good content to include paid advertisements. You can pay for these advertisements to appear on search engine queries as google ads, native ads, display ads, or social media ads on platforms like Facebook and Twitter.
5. Local SEO Practices
Customers often search for products close to their locations. Local SEO involves optimizing your website to feature in local search query results. You can optimize your website to your locality by using local keywords, creating webpages specific to your location, or including your business on Google My Business and Google Maps.
Search engine optimization is critical to making your marketing strategy effective. By optimizing your content, you are guaranteed high rankings for your site on search engines. High rankings translate to high conversion rates from your prospects. Call Clairant to start optimizing your site today!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/what-is-the-best-pet-during-a-pandemic,"These are the Clairant chickens, excited for the human food scraps in which they are about to indulge. Hens are the absolute best choice for pets that give back emotionally, affectionately and with food every morning! They are excellent with kids and super cheap to keep! These are a great pet to buy during the Covid-19 crisis because they feed you, stay outside to live, and provide some extra joy in your life!
We had 5 hens until last week (will tell that story next time) and we usually get 3-5 eggs per day from 5 hens. We now have 4 hens and so that number has been reduced to 2-4 eggs per day. That more than feeds a family of four plus we have happy neighbors, friends and clients who frequently get free, fresh eggs from the Clairant hens.
You need a small coop where they will sleep and lay eggs safely. The coop should contain a roosting bar for them to sleep and a couple laying boxes. They usually share the same one even if more are provided as you can see in the video where all three eggs were laid in the same box. They must be fully protected with a fence top bottom and sides to ensure protection from foxes, hawks and other predators. When you are around they can free range and will follow you around your yard like little puppies.
I usually spend about $15 every 6 weeks or so for high protein quality food for the egg laying hens. They also love almost all table scraps. as. you can see in the video we gave them leftovers from dinner last night including sweet potato, green tops of strawberries, anise, cucumbers and some raddicio (how do you spell that?) They also love to forage for, ticks, bugs, worms and greenery or any other edible source of protein they can find. That includes your garden plants and flowers so look out if they free range.
The ""girls"" will put themselves to bed at sundown and find their way back to their living quarters no matter how large your yard is. But make sure to lock them up so predators can't get in. These are just a few fun reasons to have hens at home by keeping you occupied, kids happy, and your tummy full. More about the Clairant hens to come!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/what-the-heck-is-neuromarketing,"Have you ever wondered why a customer chooses to purchase one product over another?
Scientists believe that our brains are in constant motion - our feelings and our actions are in direct response to our brain’s neuronal activity.
So how does this relate to your startup business?
All business and customer purchasing power breaks down to a few things: customer growth, opportunity, exposure, and needs/wants. Neuromarketing is a breakthrough in marketing innovation.
Neuromarketing techniques allow a startup business to bring their product to a customer through clear marketing choices. In order to properly market yourself and your product, you need to fully understand your customer.
Understanding neuroscience in business helps you to get behind your customers choices and it can help you to position yourself for success.
Clairant explains:
What Is Neuromarketing?
Neuromarketing is marketing that studies consumer psychology.
What is consumer psychology?
First, you need to understand what exactly neuromarketing is.
“Neuromarketing” loosely refers to the measurement of physiological and neural signals to gain insight into customers' motivations, preferences, and decisions, which can help inform creative advertising, product development, pricing, and other marketing areas. -Harvard Business Review
Analyzing neural activity can help us to understand in a clear way how your ideal customer’s sales brain works. This scientific marketing information can then be applied in your startup’s choices - to shape and improve management, your internal team-building, your marketing choices and innovation.
Why Is It important? How Does Neuromarketing Work?
Neuromarketing in business is important because it gives you the clearest insight into the behavior of your customer.
Once you understand buyer psychology and behavior, you can more clearly match their needs and even potentially change their opinions and actions.
When your startup focuses on behavioral science, it allows you to bypass conscious biases. It gives you the power to understand and identify a customer’s automatic reactions. It gives you the power to predict consumer outcomes, cognitively.
This cognitive marketing stimulates your customers emotionally.
Examples Of Neuromarketing
Some of the largest and most powerful brands use neuromarketing in their efforts to grow their customer base and to encourage their existing and new customers to buy. It is important to study neuromarketing examples from some of the leading neuromarketing companies.
Here are some examples of neuromarketing:
How Can Small Businesses Utilize Neuromarketing?
Clearly the BIG companies are utilizing neuromarketing to their benefit. So how can you?
Some small steps you can take:
Wrap Up
In conclusion, neuromarketing is an incredible and necessary tool for startups. Small choices in your approach with customers can make a big difference.
Neuromarketing tools and study can aid a startup in fully understanding their customers.
Don’t worry if knowing how to employ neuromarketing feels overwhelming. Call Clairant Services for help - we are here to design a marketing program that is simple, affordable, and meets your needs.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/why-it-pays-to-have-outsourced-marketing-leadership-on-your-team,"Having marketing leadership expertise on your team can be the line that separates you from a growing company and a failing company. Every small business should have a marketing resource whether they are a one man operation or have hundreds of employees. There are two main routes to choosing the head of a marketing department: an in-house hire or an outsourced marketing contractor. Although the two may seem equally as beneficial at first glance, outsourcing carries a few major benefits that your company should consider when filling that leadership role. Here are the top four benefits of outsourcing your marketing leadership:
Expertise
Hiring an outside marketing professional as your marketing contractor brings with it a wide range of skills, experience, training, and insight that your in-house team may have been lacking. Marketing contractors, like the professionals at Clairant, are equipped with all the tools to turn your marketing department into a well oiled machine.
Efficiency
Like most outsourcing, a major benefit of outsourcing your marketing leadership is a boost in efficiency. Placing the burdens of your marketing team in the hands of someone else clears your schedule right up, leaving you to focus on other aspects of your business. So instead of dividing your team’s attention and juggling too many tasks at once, inevitably slowing things down, you can get back to what you do best while your marketing contractors take care of the rest.
Strategy & Implementation
No team is complete without a coach that knows how and when to get things done. It’s one thing to know what needs to be done as a marketing team, but it’s another entirely to know how to get that done. Marketing contractors are skilled at doing just that. Someone guaranteed to properly strategize and implement positive change and progress is something many departments lack. With an outsourced marketing leader, yours doesn’t have to.
Cost-Effectiveness
Which would you prefer? Paying an in-house employee a full salary plus benefits for a job they may not be well suited for, or paying a contracted employee for just the time you need them, nothing more? Saving money is another benefit to (and common reason for) having your marketing management outsourced. Pay for what you need, when you need, so you never have to worry about whether or not you’re getting your money’s worth.
Whether you’re just putting together your marketing team or looking to improve your existing one, it’s worth it to consider hiring a marketing contractor like our experts here at Clairant. We’ve helped make all kinds of businesses successful, and guarantee to do the same for yours.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/why-print-media-is-still-important-in-a-digital-age,"Visibility is the main selling point of online marketing, but with endless online content, it’s easy for your marketing efforts to go unseen and ignored. Although there are countless upsides to going digital, it’s best not to only go digital and neglect one of the biggest advantages to your marketing strategies: print media. Here’s why print media is still worth pursuing in today’s market.
Tangibility is Engaging
An ad on a computer or cell phone screen is only temporary, and viewers can often easily skip it or scroll away. Printed materials like brochures, publications, posters, flyers, white papers, and more are not so easily discarded, and can be a physical, persistent reminder of your brand to those that come in contact with it.
Conveys Credibility
Since the very beginning of publishing and newspapers, print has conveyed a sense of professionalism and legitimacy (whether the content deserves it or not). Take the New York Times, for example: most people would trust the judgement of their best seller list over some online article by a lesser source. The same is true about other forms of printed material, so don’t underestimate the added value your content could gain.
Establishes Your Brand
Printed advertising and other marketing materials tend to offer more real estate than online content, and the more space you have, the easier it is to get your brand and message across. Taking advantage of good visual branding like color schemes, graphics, fonts, and even textures can set your content apart.
Reaches Your Target Market
By being strategic in your placement of your print marketing material, you can reach your target audience with excellent precision. Targeting the right demographics with your distribution allows you to reach even the most niche market, so long as you do your research on where and when you’re likely to get the best return on your investment.
-
We’re not saying it’s prudent to abandon your online efforts at all; just that you should consider expanding your efforts into print as well. In fact, great coordination and consistency between your online marketing and your print marketing can give you the best chance possible at establishing, growing, and maintaining a memorable brand and thriving company.
Don’t worry about figuring all of this out on your own, though. Marketing, regardless of its medium, is an endeavor best done with the help of an experienced team, and our busy bees at Clairant are here for just that.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/why-scalability-is-so-important-in-marketing-technologies,"As your business grows and changes, your marketing tools should as well. The technology that you might have used in the startup phase of your company won't help you succeed as you become more established and grow your customer base. Instead, you need technology that is scalable. Read on to learn why scalability is an essential capability in marketing technology.
Effective Marketing for the Post-Startup Stage
When your business has grown beyond the startup stage, it's time to reassess the marketing tools you're using. Basic technology, such as email automation, allows you to reach many people at once, however, it can lack important capabilities, such as the ability to prioritize qualified leads over others or automatically scale up as your business grows. The right technology can do more for you, such as track buyers throughout all stages of the sales cycle, and improve your lead conversion rate.
Optimize Your Marketing Campaigns
As your audience grows, it becomes more challenging for an in-house marketing team to handle prioritizing qualified leads. However, using a unified, scalable system can allow you to reliably measure data, optimize your messaging, and measure your campaign's return on investment. Making the switch to more sophisticated marketing technology can allow you to:
Improve Your Lead Conversion Rate
The right technology helps you track all of your leads, not just qualified ones. You can easily track your audience's behavior across all of your online platforms and develop targeted content for early-stage prospects. Sending specialized content to your audience according to their buyer stage is a much more effective solution than the mass email marketing you might have been using in the beginning.
Adopting scalable marketing tools will help your business learn more about your audience and better handle leads. The right technology can do more for you than what your marketing team could do on their own. Finding continued success in the post-startup stage doesn't have to be difficult. Make the first step today: call Clairant for all your marketing needs!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/why-you-need-brand-guidelines,"Every firm has a brand, whether actively created or evolved through time. Brand standards, often known as style guides or brand guidelines, are integral to an efficient marketing plan and optimal brand recognition. Your brand guidelines conveys your company's design principles to everyone in your organization.
Clients will assume that your items and services are high quality, desirable, and trustworthy if your branding makes a strong impact. However, if your branding falls short of expectations, customers may believe your brand is of inferior quality compared to rivals, even if this is not the case. However, there are various reasons why developing a set of brand rules is worthwhile. So, what's the point of having brand guidelines? Here are some of the reasons:
1. Ensure Consistency
One of the several benefits of brand guidelines is that they enable you to develop a distinct brand image. The importance of brand consistency across multiple platforms cannot be overstated. Brands are built through strategic marketing tactics, so establishing an identity is a lot easier once you have principles to assist you in keeping a consistent image and brand inspiration.
2. Build Recognition
A strong brand will have no issue generating referral business. Strong branding often indicates that consumers have a favorable view of the firm. They are more inclined to conduct business with you because of the familiarity and presumed reliability of utilizing a name they recognize.
3. Set Standard Rules
Setting standards for your brand will contain more than simply a color palette and many variants of your logo. Your brand guidelines will include explicit rules and criteria for using those components.
Knowing a company’s business standards will enable anyone designing a brand message to know and understand which aspects to utilize and how to use them. It's all about continuity, but it's also about recognizing what's proper and incorrect when incorporating those brand components.
4. Convey Cohesive Messaging
You should ensure that the message you convey to your target audience is coherent in all your visual identities and holds up to business continuity standards. That is why you should have a brand guideline as a reference by all your graphic designers and content creators. The importance of a cohesive message is that your target audience will come across your logo, website, and brochures, and you wouldn't want to leave them confused about your brand.
5. Save Time
When your brand style is consistent, you don't need to spend more time and money to create new visuals and your brand's content. The same applies to brand redesign. Your content creators will refer to your brand guidelines for recreation.
6. Avoid Chaotic Situations
Brand guidelines are to brand, what a manual is to a weapon. A manual helps soldiers learn how to handle an arm. Similarly, brand guidelines will help new employees learn how to uphold the brand identity without the need to remind them of everything they're supposed to do constantly.
Brand guidelines help ensure that every client's engagement with your brand is as strong and successful as possible. They serve as a point of reference and a benchmark for how your brand is represented to the rest of the world. That mentioned, Clairant is around to support you and help with optimizing your company’s branding and recognition. We provide various services such as web design, lead nurturing, social media management, and video marketing. Make the first step: call Clairant today!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/why-you-should-be-marketing-with-videos,"What is your go-to marketing medium? Did you know it has been reported that video marketing happens to be about 600% more effective than direct mail or print advertising? Videos are easy to digest, more memorable, engaging and entertaining all at the same time. The point is put across often within seconds and there is little investment of time from the viewers' standpoint.
Statistics show that 55% of people on social media watch videos every single day. Videos that are shared on social media generate up to more than 1200% more shares than regular posts and photos.
So how long should your videos be? Depending on what you are trying to achieve with your videos (entertaining or educating), the ideal length is somewhere between 15 seconds and 2.5 minutes. When creating videos, the MPG4 format is most ideal for posting on social media because you can maintain quality while the file size stays small.
Videos are easy to watch and to produce from both the viewers’ point of view and the marketers' point of view and they potentially develop a much larger ROI than other forms of advertising.
So start video marketing and increase your ROI!

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/writing-tips-for-improving-your-emails-click-through-rates,"When it comes to emails, success is measured by click-through rates. The success of your email marketing strategy is measured by these numbers.
Who clicked through? Why did they click though?
In 2022, email marketing is still the strongest overall return on your marketing campaign investment.
So how can you get the highest click through rates, and how can email marketing fuel your overall inbound strategy?
Clairant, a leader in startup marketing and an email marketing specialist, sheds some light on this.
Email Marketing Like A Pro
Email marketing is a very powerful tool. Startups everywhere want to know how to improve email marketing campaigns.
Success in email marketing all boils down to click through rates (CTR). These click throughs show what percentage of your email audience is actually interested in your product or service.
“CTR is the number of clicks that your ad receives
divided by the number of times your ad is shown:
clicks ÷ impressions = CTR.
For example, if you had 5 clicks and 100 impressions,
then your CTR would be 5%”
-Google.
An average CTR is about 7%. If your company’s CTR is below 7%, then your email marketing needs an overhaul and some improvements.
If your CTR is 8-12% then your email marketing strategy is working well.
Measured and analyzed CTR helps you to more clearly understand your customers and their needs/desires. This in turn helps your startup not only meet the needs of your customers, it allows you to find ways to build that audience.
Strong CTR equals strong business gains.
So how can you improve your email marketing lead generation?
Ways To Improve Your Click Through Rate
A startup can improve their targeted email marketing strategies for their email marketing database by following some simple sales email tips.
Email like a boss tips:
Startup Solutions for CTRs and Email Marketing
There are many ways to get started on your email marketing strategy.
The Take-Away
Upping your email game through a strategic email marketing campaign can give your startup a real boost in sales.
How can email marketing improve sales?
It’s simple.
Clicks = Potential Sales.
Email marketing will increase your startup’s sales at an affordable price. New email marketing tools will help your startup have the ability to reach existing and new customers more easily than ever before.
A solid email marketing strategy will help you grow and reach your business goals. The connection with your targeted audience will improve through personalized emails that have high CTRs.

https://www.clairantservices.com/blog/writing-tips-for-improving-your-landing-page-copy,"What is a Landing Page?
A landing page is a specific web page that stands alone. It is not your homepage. Your future customers “land” on this page (hence the title) when they are directed by your email or digital advertisement.
Landing page vs Home Page:
The major difference between your landing page and your homepage is that they are created with different purposes in mind.
Clairant Services marketing experts explain:
The purpose of a website homepage is to set the stage for your startup - as an introduction. Your landing page purpose differs.
The purpose of your click-through landing pages is to gather some information from potential customers and contacts by offering something of value to the customer. This could be a retail sales offer code or a download.
Let’s delve further into the purpose of your landing page…
What is the Purpose of a Landing Page?
A landing page has a singular focus. It sells an action.
It is important that you grab the attention of your potential customers and contacts through your landing page.
Startup landing pages need to be directed to your target audience segment.
Three key factors when choosing a target segment:
To find your target audience you can use generated target audience surveys.
Once your potential audience is discovered, you will need to grab the attention of your direct audience.
What are the Key Components of a Landing Page?
To grab the attention of your audience, you will need to include several components to your landing page.
Components of a landing page:
What are the Types of Landing Pages?
Not all landing pages are the same. There are several types of landing pages and they serve different purposes for your startup.
These key types of landing pages are:
Writing Tips For A Great Landing Page
The literal writing of your landing page is important for keeping it competitive in today’s market. Luckily, there are many examples of landing pages online.
In general, customers these days have shorter attention spans, so the critical info needs to be compelling and brief.
Some things to consider:
If you are wondering how to be more relatable with your landing page, just remember to show your customers that you are just like them. Be open about mistakes and concerns. Be personable by including examples.
Be sure to keep your writing simple and short, and close with a “thank you” to your customer, as well.
In closing, if you are still wondering how to write content for a landing page - don’t stress! You can find many landing page copywriting templates and website copy templates online. These templates can simplify the process for a startup by providing simple guidelines that can create effective landing pages.
In addition to this, hiring a marketing professional for your landing page marketing is a time-saving and effective way to know for sure that your pages will reap the most benefits.

https://www.clairantservices.com/case-study.html,"See how we help one of our clients...
Client.
Virtual Answering Service Company.
An established virtual answering service company in Florida provides dispatching and receptionist services 24/7/365 for their clients. Their goal is to help clients increase their availability to handle prospect and customer calls and to optimize their customer service. Having been in business for more than 50 years and currently employing over 100 employees, the company services an extensive and diverse client base of approximately 400 businesses from blue collar companies to executive professional services in a variety of industries.
Target Market.
Owners and decision makers for companies primarily in the following industries: Elevator, Property Management, Oil & Gas, HVAC, and Plumbing.
Problem.
Unsubstantial customer acquisition and marketing efforts.
Despite having a large employee pool of trained experts in virtual customer service, and having a competent and experienced management team, the company was lacking in marketing leadership, and generally assigned tasks to employees of different departments to take on marketing responsibilities. There was no marketing strategy and very little marketing efforts were put forth. As a result, the company was lacking in customer acquisition, thus stagnating business and revenue growth.
Solution.
Utilizing Clairant's external marketing professionals.
The owner of the company compared marketing agencies and chose Clairant as their #1 choice to help with their marketing efforts. Clairant provided the leadership that they needed through Fractional CMO Services and all the digital marketing resources needed to execute a solid marketing strategy at a fraction of the cost of hiring a full time CMO. The plan was to use Clairant’s resources for implementation as well as some internal employees.
Strategy.
Clairant provided a variety of services and reporting:
Reporting.
Each week, the Clairant team delivers a list of hot leads who interacted with any of the content on all email marketing campaigns, determined using analytics. This reporting includes the contact information of whomever clicked on any videos, blogs, and all other marketing content that is pushed out on emails. The leads are then sent to the sales team to call and close deals.
Investment - $5,000/month
Results.
From the marketing strategy and implementation plan created by Clairant, the company invested $5,000 a month and broke even at the 5-6 month mark. By month 12, they had doubled their investment generating $10,000 in monthly revenue directly linked back to the planned multi-channel marketing activities. They generated 20 new accounts and continue to grow on a weekly basis. The conversion rates drastically increased due to the sales team receiving weekly hot leads directly from the engaged contacts on the email marketing list. The company is thrilled with their results and continues to dedicate a healthy investment in their marketing program, and they are considering increasing their spend with Clairant in the months to come.
Revenue - $10,000/month in added revenue"

Why is Social Media Important?
At Clairant we teach our clients that organic social media maintenance is not necessarily the best lead generating tool. What it is, is a great validation tool. When you have a potential customer who is choosing between you and your competitors, what's the first thing they are going to do to compare you? Check you out on Google, and on their favorite social media platform to see what you have been up to. How great is your branding and online presence? Do you post good quality content consistently on your social media platforms? Do you provide evidence to support that you know your industry, products and services inside and out? Are you outlining what your differentiators are? Do you entertain and educate your target audience? Can they trust your brand enough to invest in for your products or services? If not they are moving on to a competitor that fulfills all these gaps. If you are not answering these questions positively then you are surely missing out on potential revenue for your business. Stop losing sleep over managing your social media pages and leave the task to our busy social media bees who will take your online presence from good to great!"
