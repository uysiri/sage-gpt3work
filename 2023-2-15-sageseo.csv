1,https://www.sageseo.ai/3-critical-seo-rules-that-founders-cant-ignore/,"You’re a founder who wants to drive organic traffic to your website through optimization. But you need affordable SEO – you aren’t looking to spend the big money demanded by digital marketing agencies.
Where do you start?
How do you create quality content that Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo will recognize as the best answer to a search query?
In this short article, I will give you three critical SEO rules for founders to keep in mind with the end goal of getting eyeballs on your content –
- Search Intent
- Competition
- Conversion
Think of these as less than rules, but more than ‘nice to have‘.
They should guide your decisions rather than force you to adhere to a structure.
Rule #1 – Search Intent
What question are you trying to answer?
That is to say, whose problem are you trying to solve with this content? Put yourself at the keyboard of the person at the search bar, and ask “how does the information I am presenting satisfy their needs?” This is a very different approach than trying to describe a feature you offer, a service you provide, or something special about your product.
With this mindset, you focus on the searcher rather than on yourself, and, as it turns out, this makes a significant difference in the way you should present your content.
There are a few reasons why this will produce better results than simply promoting your goods and services.
First, when you approach the content from the end-user perspective you will focus less on the things you like about the product and more on the things that customers care about.
Second, search engine algorithms have moved beyond simple keyword recognition and backlink detection and are actively trying to present their users with results that best solve the question being asked.
Consider that 32% of all clicks go to the first search result, and 99% of searches never leave the front page. This suggests that search engines are getting pretty good at serving up content that satisfies their user’s desires, not just content that happens to be in the same neighborhood.
Finally, keeping search intent at the front of your mind helps you present your product/goods/services as the solution to someone’s problem, which in turn is going to help with the second and third considerations: competition and conversion.
Rule #2 – Competition
Who are you competing with for these search results?
If you don’t know the answer to that, you’re at tremendous risk of running headlong into a classic blunder. It’s not ‘never start a land war in Asia‘ bad, but definitely not good. The mistake is trying to fight an established brand on their home turf.
As a startup founder, you have a lot of advantages, but what you don’t have is name recognition, a huge marketing budget, and an established reputation. Trying to break into your competition’s search “fortress” with paid advertising can cost 3-6x what they are currently spending.
So what can you do?
At Sage SEO, we recommend that you come at the problem sideways, rather than charging headlong at their moated and walled castle. Focus on differentiating yourself from the competition, and build your initial content around those differences. Find out what keywords your competition is missing, are there any that you can pick off?
What products/services/features/functionality do you have that they do not?
When you create content with an eye to where your competition is weak, you provide yourself the best opportunity to get to the front page and first rank on search results. While it is true that you will not be getting as many eyeballs as if you were where your competitor is today, you’ll be getting a lot more than if you are on page 3 for the same terms.
Consider the following example:
ChrisCo vs NAE
Chris’s startup “ChrisCo” is going to change the world, eventually.
Although North American Enterprises dominates the field today, ChrisCO has a way to do the same thing better, faster, and cheaper than NAE.
Consider two possible SEO strategies:
- Creating high-quality content that targets the same keywords NAE ranks for in hopes of displacing them
- NAE has the #1 result on Google for the top search terms that ChrisCO is targeting
- After six months, ChrisCO ranks between 3rd and 15th for most of these terms
- People searching for these terms always see NAE’s results above ChrisCO’s
- Some traffic will come from the 3rd place ranking, but most will go to NAE.
- Creating high-quality content that highlights the ways ChrisCO is different from NAE, specifically aiming at areas and keywords where NAE has poor SEO or there are underserved keywords in the search engine world:
- NAE has results between 15 and 90 for the constellation of targeted search terms
- After six months, ChrisCO ranks between 3rd and 9th for most of these terms, and gets the top ranking for one keyword.
- People searching for these terms will always see ChrisCO’s content before NAE’s, and are more likely to come to ChrisCO’s site as it solves their problem
Because the content focused on areas where ChrisCO is strong and NAE is weak, Chris was able to rank higher on Google for the same amount of effort. While fewer people may search for the specific keywords used in that content, it is better to get 75% of a pear than 1% of a watermelon! This chart shows the Click-Through-Results for searches on Google. It’s always better to be on the front page!
Rule #3 – Conversion: A-B-C
The final and most important guideline is to remember why you are creating content.
You want the person reading to sign up for a demo, or a sales call, or simply purchase what you are selling. You can create a lot of content, get hundreds of thousands of eyeballs to your site, but if you haven’t moved the needle on sales, all you’ve done is spend a lot of cycles succeeding at failing.
You need a strong call to action in your piece.
At Sage SEO, we work with startup founders to help them understand the best way to move the needle on conversions. Yes, we have a powerful suite of SEO tools built specifically for startups and small businesses.
But what sets us apart is our commitment to working with founders to give them the insight they need to understand what has/hasn’t worked for them in the past, and what they need to do to improve their inbound organic traffic in the future.
What do you do that sets you apart? How can you weave that into the content you create, in a way that makes someone reading it say “well, I certainly want to know more about that” and click the link.
Conclusion
When you create content that incorporates:
1) Intent: Solves user problems – genuinely provides them with good insight into what they are looking for,
2) Competition: Focused on what differentiates you from your competitors, aimed at places where they aren’t, and
3) Conversion: A strong call to action that leads readers to click through to learn more about whatever it is you do,
you will be on the right track to get the powerful results that SEO can provide.

2,https://www.sageseo.ai/3-things-to-understand-about-googles-helpful-content-update/,"Google just pushed the ‘helpful content’ update to its SEO algorithm. In this quick video Peter, Sage SEO’s founder, breaks down the three things you need to know about this update as a content creator!
Ensure you’re not negatively affected by the update!
There are three primary considerations in Google’s ‘helpful content’ update. First, Google is now prioritizing content created by real people for real people in its search results.
What does that mean for you? If you use AI writing engines, auto-generated content suggestions, or even non-native speakers as content creators, Google may penalize your search appearances.
Why would they do that? Google appears to believe content not written by real people to be of ‘lesser quality, and therefore less deserving to be highly ranked within Search Results.
Second, if your brand posts a variety of content across multiple areas of interest or disciplines, then you’re likely to be negatively hit by this update as well. On top of that, if you’re using algorithm-chasing SEO tools that analyze top-performing search results to recommend word counts and other details, Google is likely to crack down on you too!

4,https://www.sageseo.ai/a-review-of-the-top-web-payment-solutions-for-your-small-business/,"Payment solutions are essential for your business, but with so many different product offerings, how do you know that what you’re using is the most optimal for YOUR business? We’re here to provide a comparison between all of the most commonly used payment solutions so that you can make the most informed decision.
We’ll examine Stripe, PayPal, Square, Amazon Payments, and Shopify and go over the most important strengths and weaknesses of each in this comparison. Most of these payment solutions don’t have glaring weaknesses, but they do vary slightly and can affect your business in small but significant ways, so we’ve added a conclusion at the end that will define the best use cases for each.
PayPal:
The most compelling reason to use PayPal is its user base. Everyone has a PayPal account and it is going to be convenient for both you and your buyer. PayPal fees are 2.9% per transaction plus 30 cents, which is very competitive. It’s worth noting that PayPal is most associated with eBay, but they’ve since somewhat parted ways. The other PayPal feature that sets it apart is its ability to convert currency. While PayPal might charge extra for the customer, they can pay in whatever currency they wish and the seller will still receive the same amount in the converted currency of the seller’s choice. PayPal shipping is another great feature, which allows PayPal to be turned into an all-in-one reference center for the customer.
Conclusion: PayPal is great for all businesses and easy to use, but won’t offer you tailored features.
Stripe:
Stripe is a developer-focused payment solution with tons of APIs/developer tools and great mobile payment options. The product is more powerful than PayPal, with added features like subscription billing and one-click checkout. The drawback, however, is that it requires technical skill to implement. Designed for larger firms, it requires more input from your business’ side. Stripe fees are remarkably low, at 2.9% for non-European cards and an excellent 1.4% for European cards. The main reason to use Stripe is its analytics, however, which allow a business to view a dashboard with all the data collected through their transactions.
Conclusion: Stripe is great for those with technical know-how and a need for a powerful and flexible POS (point of sale) system.
Square:
Square is great for those with physical locations. They offer easy-to-use all-in-one solutions for payment, with Interac functionality. Square fees are also one of the most competitively-priced, with 2.65% across all cards. Their competitive fees make them great for small businesses. Debit transactions are a flat 10 cents. They offer hardware to supplement their software, and their solutions are simple albeit quite pricey.
Conclusion: Square is great for businesses who need physical POS locations without their own infrastructure.
Amazon Pay:
Amazon Pay brings Amazon’s brand recognition to your brand, with the ability for customers to pay for your products using Amazon’s software infrastructure. This integration with the Amazon store also allows sellers to merge their Amazon and site offerings into a single stream. Purchases are also covered with Amazon’s A-to-Z guarantee, which will mean more peace of mind for your customers. The flat rate of 2.9% + 30 cents will be hard to swallow, however, and their customer service has been reported to be spotty. They also require an Amazon account, which can be a positive or negative, depending on who your target customer base are.
Conclusion: Amazon Pay is great for businesses who sell on Amazon already, but better options are available elsewhere if that isn’t an option.
Shopify:
Shopify Payments offers industry-leading pricing, with Shopify fees being around 2.4-2.7% + 30 cents. Shopify is also easy to integrate for online businesses, something proven by its market share in the online space. It lacks the more powerful tools and APIs of a platform like Stripe, but makes up for it through ease-of-use. It’s a market leader, and the integration it features with shipping and tracking make it an appealing hub for customers as well. The downside is that Shopify isn’t very customizable, which means that those with particular demands for a payment solution will find themselves less satisfied with Shopify’s offerings than competitors.
Conclusion: Overall, Shopify is great for online businesses and fee-sensitive businesses.
In conclusion, every payment solution has strengths and weaknesses that interact with each business differently. All are valid options, and we hope that we’ve made the choice easier for you with this guide!"

In this short video, Sage SEO’s founder, Peter, talks about conversion rate optimization (CRO), what the components of CRO are, and how it fits into the grand SEO puzzle.
Peter starts by breaking down the fundamental concepts of CRO. After watching, you’ll want to hop onto your website’s dashboard and start wading knee-deep in analytics.
Curious? Read on! Don’t leave money on the table!
Conversions do not equal SEO. Search engine optimization is all about your tactics to drive as many eyeballs to your website as possible.
You can think of SEO as opportunities; opportunities to sell your product, share valuable information, build trust with clients, and set up engagement to make sales later on.
Conversions are the next stage in securing sales after your SEO tactics bring users to your website. Conversion rate optimization is a continuous process built on measuring every website metric you can.
How many website visitors are you getting per day? Where are they coming from?
After you’ve identified where visitors are coming from, how many of them make desirable actions? Desirable actions are interesting, because, depending on what you specialize in, a potential lead’s desirable actions could be an email sign-up or a sale.
You can think of the different stages a customer moves through as a journey. Once you understand your customers’ journeys, you can make better-informed decisions to hook them onto your business."
17,https://www.sageseo.ai/dojs-google-lawsuit-what-it-means-for-small-businesses-and-consumers/,"Yesterday was a jarring news day for Google as the US Department of Justice announced an anti-trust lawsuit claiming allegations that Google has created a monopoly in the ad tech industry.
It’s the continuation of a strategy by DoJ to protect consumers and businesses from higher prices by attempting to break up some of the Google monopolies that control digital advertising spending and revenue on the Internet.
Personally, I think this is a fantastic step to help small businesses and startups who have limited marketing budgets and need every opportunity they can get to optimize advertising costs for acquiring new customers to their businesses.
I think it’s important to dive into the details of what the issue is, how it impacts the business world, and what are the benefits of alternative options like search engine optimization (SEO).
What is the primary problem DoJ is trying to rectify?
If I were to simplify the argument greatly, the primary issue is that Google controls the large majority of the internet search market at ~89%. They use this huge market share to generate advertising revenue by running digital ads in just about every website location imaginable.
Here are just a few of those:
- At the top of search results
- In the sidebars of its ad tech company partners (these are called display ads)
- On small business websites that receive a very small percentage of sales from ad clicks
Google controls search and, by proxy, the primary location where internet users can be found. Google, through its acquisition of DoubleClick in 2008, also controls the marketplace technology that is used to sell ads to advertisers and publishers of content.
As a small business owner, a startup, or any other business, you’re left with only a few viable options if you want to run paid digital advertising. Google is the option for search ads, and Facebook and its affiliates are the equivalent for social ads.
How does this impact both small business owners and startups?
The short answer to this question is higher prices. The less choice that small business owners and startups have to advertise their business online, the more money they have to spend. This is seen in the average cost-per-click (CPC) prices rising 22% in 2022 alone. It was a marked increase from the previous year. Prices in 2021 “only” increased 5% overall.
A higher cost-per-click results in higher lead-generation costs for companies That means each website visitor costs more to acquire, and each subsequent sale is more expensive for the business. Small businesses typically already operate at low margins. This means they can’t absorb this cost themselves and have to pass the increasing advertising costs onto the consumer, resulting in higher product and services prices.
Coupling these higher costs with recent consumer privacy efforts from Apple and Facebook is a 1-2 punch in digital advertising. The sharing of personal information, browsing habits, etc., informs all digital advertising strategies, and as consumer privacy advocates continue to push for less information sharing, digital advertising will become less and less efficient over time.
What does this mean for the world of SEO?
Digital advertising has always been a tremendous easy button to attract website visitors, assuming you have the budget. The potential of DoJ’s efforts to reduce monopolies and slow down the rising costs of CPC advertising is there, but how long will it take?
Additionally, the privacy measures in place will continue to impact the efficiency of online advertising negatively.
It’s an intuitive and proven point that paid advertising already converts at lower rates vs. organic traffic. Because organic traffic yields more engaged users, it tends to build trust as you’re teaching them something important or answering their questions. Maybe you’re connecting them directly to a product that solves their problem.
My general recommendation is, and remains, that digital advertising is a critical lead-generation engine for a website, but it needs to be complemented by a strong SEO and content marketing approach.
Relying solely on digital ads to bring in website visitors is both an expensive proposition and a risky endeavor. There is the opportunity cost of not running an organic strategy and leaving that option open for your competitors. But more importantly, it’s an opportunity missed to generate higher quality visitors to your website who recognize your brand, trust it, and share it with their friends."
18,https://www.sageseo.ai/getting-started-with-content-marketing-the-5-yard-out-pattern/,"I was speaking with a customer this afternoon and the topic of getting started came up. They have a number of priorities pulling them in various directions. They know content marketing is critical to their long-term customer acquisition. But they also know the ROI won’t be obvious for months from their efforts.
It brought to light a basic tenant we all face in this world.
Content marketing is hard.
And there are a lot of reasons why it’s difficult. However, we all know the benefits of content marketing. The more content you create for your target customers, the more relevant it is to their day-to-day and the problems they are trying to solve, then the more engagement you’ll get when those customers visit your website.
More engagement from your website visitors equals better metrics for Google’s algorithm. It contributes positively to lowering your bounce rate. It helps increase average session time per user and average page views per session.
You may not be fully aware of what those metrics are or where they reside within Google Analytics, but rest assured, they are important metrics when it comes to your SEO rankings.
But how do you get started? Let’s look at an analogy.
The College Football Equivalent of Getting Started with Content Marketing
I’m a big fan of college football. One of the most exciting parts of a college football game is the last two minutes of the game when your team is down, and they need a big drive to kick a game-winning field goal.
If you ask any football coach, they will tell you that establishing a rhythm quickly is very important to the 2-minute drive. The pressure is on. Your team is behind, and you have to drive 50 yards to have a chance of making a field goal.
Coaches help the quarterbacks and receivers establish this rhythm by completing a short pass, for example, a 5-yard out pattern. This builds confidence for the offense, it creates momentum, and it puts the wheels in motion for the drive.
How to Start Marketing Your Business
Creating momentum with your content marketing strategy is very similar to getting that first 5-yard out pattern completed. You want to create some momentum. But your mind may be set on a 3,500-word blog post that explains a critical concept to your business in intimate detail.
The problem with a 3,500-word blog idea is that you actually have to WRITE 3,500 words. That takes a long time.
You procrastinate. You delay. You prioritize other things. You start looking at content marketing tools. You investigate the latest and greatest types of content marketing.
You plan out your content strategy for the next two months on your favorite content marketing platforms. Maybe you get your Google sheet created instead and read 5 articles on content marketing for startups.
What you haven’t done is actually write an article. Because you know it’s going to take you 10 hours to write 3,500 words. You’re going to need to spend another hour doing keyword research. And you’ll probably need product managers and others to sign off on the content because of the depth you’ve gone into the topic.
Here’s my advice. Throw the 5-yard out!
The Quick, Easy Win
There are a huge number of types of marketing content. But the very best type of content? That’s easy. It’s the published content.
The content that isn’t sitting in a Google Doc somewhere or stuck in your head as a bunch of ideas.
As they say in sports, the best ability is availability. And the content marketing equivalent of that is actually publishing your content and doing it regularly.
The best ability is availability.
So pick a topic to write about. Think about something your potential customers will find interesting. Write 250 or 500 words about it in 45 minutes instead of 10 hours.
And then, do something crazy! Publish the article.
Google loves new content and sometimes, you’re your own worst enemy with planning.
Don’t paralyze yourself with analysis.
Throw the 5-yard out."
19,https://www.sageseo.ai/getting-started-with-seo-for-small-businesses-a-beginners-guide/,"What is SEO and how does it work?
‘SEO’ stands for Search Engine Optimization. A search engine is a platform that scans the web for information relating to somebody’s search term – the most widely used being Google. The optimization part of the term refers to maximizing the quality and quantity of traffic that arrives at your website through search engines.
You may be familiar with the concept of SEO content – creating content full of keywords with the purpose of generating traffic for your website – but SEO is much more than that. It also means paying attention to core web vitals like site speed, mobile user experience, and interactivity. Think about it this way: once you get people to your page, you want them to enjoy the experience and stay as long as possible, too! Plus, in 2020, Google announced that they are including these factors in how they rank pages.
Without further ado, read on for the low-down on how to execute SEO for small business websites.
The benefits of SEO for small businesses
You might be wondering why your business needs SEO. Building an SEO strategy is a valuable practice for anyone, but the importance of SEO for small businesses cannot be understated. It’s a great way to generate organic growth without making huge investments in paid ads. SEO boasts three main benefits for small businesses: higher quality leads, higher potential conversion, and boosted brand awareness.
If you’ve been considering a bit of diy seo for your small business, you’ve come to the right place. There are many SEO strategies for small business articles and blogs. But most don’t go into the details of how to execute a winning strategy at a lower cost.
Beginning with this article, we’re going to show you some fundamentals that will help you improve your SEO performance in Google search results. We will teach you how to estimate and reduce the seo costs for your small business; we’ll show you keyword research tips and even how to do SEO monitoring so you can track how your efforts are working.
Tools to track your SEO performance
Tools like Google Search Console (GSC) provide outstanding information to show you the search queries you’re ranking for and are absolutely free. We’ll cover this tool more in-depth in our next article on connecting Google’s free tools, but here’s a screenshot of the types of data you can expect from GSC.
If you’re looking for more comprehensive tools that provide a full end-to-end workflow for your SEO needs, Sage SEO could be a great choice. We offer a number of dashboards to track search performance, keyword rankings, and more.
Organic traffic leads bring in your ideal target customers much more effectively than paid ads
One of the main principles of SEO-generated leads is that those individuals are already looking for the solutions that you offer; you’re just jumping in to show ‘em what you got. Aka, you are fulfilling a need they already know they have. You don’t have to convince them that they have a problem or need a solution; you just have to convince them to pick you! And being one of the top results for their search is a great place to start. In fact, 60% of marketers state that their highest quality leads are SEO-generated customers for this exact reason.
SEO increases brand visibility
Showing up on the first page of Google for a highly relevant search term is a surefire way to be seen by customers. Achieving the top-ranking spot can more than double your click-through rate compared to the number two spot. This visibility generates a high volume of traffic, and by targeting the right keywords (keep reading to learn more about this), you’ll be generating high-quality traffic that attracts the right customers.
Plus, even if people don’t immediately click on your page, ranking for your keywords makes your brand highly visible and generates trust around your website as a resource for potential customers. They will build a strong association between your brand name and the solutions they need. This stands you in better stead for competing with other businesses and makes you more likely to be top of mind for the product or services you offer.
SEO creates the potential for higher sales and conversion rates
More eyes on your page and a fast, easy-to-use website compatible with multiple devices often translates to better conversion, aka your site’s visitors being more likely to follow your Call to Action and buy your product or service.
Plus, it’s practically vital if your competitors are engaging in an effective SEO strategy. If a customer has to decide between you and a competitor, and they see your competitor’s site and have no idea you exist, the choice is made for them. Put yourself in the running by creating an SEO strategy to rival other brands’.
How to start with SEO
Keyword research
Why is keyword research important?
Through keyword research, you can identify which search terms your audience is actually searching on Google, providing you insight on which ones to target and how to build your keywords strategy. There are a few factors to consider when selecting keywords.
What are three key considerations when evaluating keywords for search engine optimization?
1. Relevance
Google ranks content according to how relevant it is to the search term, so it will only rank your page for a keyword if, after scanning your page, it verifies that you meet the searcher’s needs.
2. Authority
Google prioritizes sources it believes to be authoritative. The more you enrich your site with valuable content and promote it with backlinks on other authoritative sites, the more signals Google has that you’re an authority. This is why it’s sometimes best to target more niche or specific keywords, as their Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) will be less dominated by sites you can’t compete with (e.g. Financial Times, Mayo Clinic). That way, you have a better chance of ranking.
3. Volume
At the same time, you don’t want to go too niche. It’s all well and good to rank on the first page for a keyword, but if virtually no one is searching it, you’re not meeting the end goal of driving traffic to your site. Volume of traffic is measured in monthly search volume (MSV), and you can use this metric to determine which keywords are your best bet.
If all of this seems a lot to consider, there are SEO tools for small businesses, like Sage SEO, that will do most of the heavy lifting for you. Get started with this e-book on the basics of SEO.
On page SEO
Why on page SEO is important
Aside from creating SEO content, on page technical SEO is an important strategy for boosting your ranking on Google. This refers to taking measures within your website’s infrastructure to help search engines categorize your content and in turn, appear for relevant search terms. This involves three main site factors: technical optimization, content optimization, website structure, and design.
What are three key considerations when evaluating your on page SEO?
1. Technical SEO optimization
This is the process of improving the technical aspects of a website to make it more visible and easily crawlable by search engines. This includes optimizing the website’s structure, performance, and content to ensure that it is accessible to search engines and can be easily indexed and ranked. Some specific techniques that may be used as part of technical SEO optimization include:
- Ensuring that the website has a clean and clear structure, with a logical hierarchy of pages and a clear navigation menu.
- Optimizing the website’s load time and performance to ensure that it loads quickly and efficiently for users.
- Making sure that the website is mobile-friendly, with a responsive design that works well on different devices.
- Ensuring that the website has a secure connection (HTTPS) and is free of errors or broken links.
- Creating a sitemap and submitting it to search engines to help them understand the structure and content of the website.
- Using clean, descriptive URLs and title tags, and including relevant keywords in the website’s content and metadata.
Technical SEO optimization is an important part of overall SEO strategy, as it helps search engines understand and index a website more effectively, which can lead to higher search rankings and more organic traffic.
2. High-quality content
Quality content is important for SEO rankings because it helps to attract and retain visitors, and it also signals to search engines that a website is relevant and valuable. When a website has high-quality, informative, and engaging content, it’s more likely to attract and retain visitors, which can lead to increased organic traffic and higher search rankings.
In addition, quality content helps to establish a website as an authority in its industry or niche, which can lead to higher search rankings. When a website consistently produces high-quality content that provides value to its visitors, it can build trust and credibility, which can lead to increased engagement and loyalty from its audience. This can also lead to increased backlinks from other websites, which can further improve your website’s search rankings.
As you create more relevant content for your target audience, your website visitors will increase and you’ll continue to build trust in your target audience. This leads to compounding benefits from each new article you post and a faster content marketing flywheel.
3. Great Website Design
Website design plays a significant role in SEO rankings because it affects how easily search engines can crawl and index a website. A well-designed website with a clear structure and logical hierarchy of pages will be easier for search engines to understand and index, which can lead to higher search rankings. On the other hand, a poorly designed website with a confusing structure and slow loading times may be more difficult for search engines to crawl and index, which can result in lower search rankings.
In addition to the technical aspects of website design, the overall user experience is also important for SEO rankings. A website that is difficult to navigate or use may discourage users from staying on the site for long periods of time, which can negatively impact the website’s search rankings. By designing a website that is easy to use and provides a positive user experience, businesses can improve their SEO rankings and increase the likelihood of attracting and retaining visitors.
The Importance of tracking SEO results to improve performance
Once you’ve developed your strategy, you’ll want to track your SEO progress to see what’s working best and to identify places where you can make improvements. The best part? Tools like Google Analytics make it simple and easy to monitor your site performance and see how your SEO efforts are paying off. But with such a wealth of metrics available, how do you decide which ones are most important?
There are five key statistics to pay attention to tracking your SEO performance:
1. Google Search Impressions
Search impressions refer to the number of times a website appears in the search results for a particular query. When a website appears in the search results, it is counted as an impression, even if the user does not click on the result.
Tracking search impressions in Google Search Console is important because it can give website owners insight into how their website is performing in the search results and how it is being discovered by users. By tracking search impressions, website owners can see which queries their website is appearing for, and how often it is being displayed in the search results.
In addition, tracking search impressions can help website owners identify opportunities to improve their SEO and increase their visibility in the search results. For example, if a website has a high number of impressions for a particular query but a low click-through rate (CTR), it may indicate that the website’s titles and descriptions in the search results are not effectively enticing users to click. By analyzing this data, website owners can identify opportunities to optimize their titles and descriptions to improve their CTR and drive more traffic to their website.
2. Organic traffic
This is the total number of visitors your site attracts solely through organic search. This helps you separate traffic that’s likely a direct impact of your SEO strategy vs. being accounted for by other marketing efforts. A good SEO strategy should see your organic traffic steadily increasing.
3. Clickthrough rate (CTR)
This indicates the percentage of searchers who actually click on your site after seeing it appear in search results. This metric is a good indicator of how effectively your page’s details capture the attention of searchers. If your page is ranking but your CTR is low, try creating more enticing meta titles and meta descriptions.
4. Keyword rankings
A large part of your strategy will be trying to rank for certain keywords, and this metric tells you how well you’re doing. You can do this manually for a few keywords, but it’s best to take a more comprehensive overview using a tool like Sage — a highly effective SEO keyword research service.
5. Bounce rate
This metric represents the number of visitors who land on your site and leave without continuing to another page. This shows how much your site’s content aligns with what users expect when they click on your page in a list of search results. A high bounce rate could be a sign that you’re targeting the wrong keywords or that they’re just too vague.
Final Thoughts
And there you have it! Search Engine Optimization can seem daunting at first, but once you break down the various components, building a website with SEO in mind becomes relatively straightforward. Now you’re well on your way to taking your small business to the next level! Don’t forget to download Sage’s free guide to the basics of SEO to help you get started."

Welcome to our Google Analytics how to guide!
What are some use cases for Google Analytics?
Building a better understanding of your viewers
The first way that the analytics Google provides can add value to your business is by building up a solid understanding of who consumes your content or engages with your site. This can tell you what demographics are more likely to interact with your pages for extensive periods of time or who needs your services.
Formulating a new strategy
Once you have a great understanding of who your target is, you can use that information to tailor your future decisions. Creating a focused plan for how to more deeply engage your target demographics can be the key to quickly multiplying your volume, and with Google Analytics expressing key data like bounce rates, you can easily create a data-driven strategy that gives you the best possible chance of success.
Tracking business performance
Lastly, after you’ve launched your new strategy, Google Analytics provides live updates to key performance indicators like users, bounce rate, time spent, views, and more! By keeping track of how your new strategy is performing, you can maintain a flexible and focused strategy that’s effectively managed every second of every day.
Which kinds of hits does Google Analytics track?
Google tracks almost every activity you could want to track, from pageview hits to screen view hits, event hits and social interaction hits, e-commerce hits, user timing hits, and even exception hits.
So I’m sold. How do I get started?
Create an account:
The first step of our Google Analytics for beginners guide is to create somewhere for Google to send its data. If you need to create a Google Analytics account, visit google.com/analytics and either create a new account or sign in through an existing Google account to get started. Otherwise, log into Google Analytics to get started!
Set up a new property:
What’s a property? Any website or page you own is your property in this context. First, complete your Google Analytics sign in. Then, go to your Google Analytics dashboard. Click the Admin button, then under the Property column, click Create Property.
You will be prompted for several pieces of information, including the name of the property, and the time zone. There are many advanced options, but if you’re unsure, go into advanced settings and select create both a Google Analytics 4 and Universal Analytics property. This will create both so you can decide later which you wish to use.
Set up a new reporting view:
To get reports on your new property, return to the Admin page, then navigate to the account and property that you want to get reports on. In the View column, select Create View. Choose whether your property is a website or a mobile app, then enter a name and your time zone. Lastly, click Create View and you’re done!
Set up a Google Analytics Site Tag:
To start getting information from the websites you want Google to track, you first need to let Google into your website. Do this by setting up a site tag by pasting the code Google gives you after the openingtag of each page of your website that you want analytics on.
What is your site tag? Under the Admin page, select Account and then Property, like how you set up your new property. In the Property menu, click Tracking Info, then Tracking Code. Your site tag is displayed in a box labeled Website Tracking – Global Site Tag. Simply copy and paste the code found here into your website under the openingtag and you’re good to go!
When does the tracking code send an event hit to Google Analytics? Google Analytics sends updates live, so you know when an event hit occurs as soon as a page with tracking enabled satisfies the criteria. So when does the analytics tracking code send a pageview hit to google analytics? Instantly.
Next Steps:
Add new members:
Got new members of a team? You can add new users to your Google Analytics account by going into the Admin page, then clicking Access Management in the Account/Property/View menu. Simply click add to add new members and manage their access!
Create new views:
Want many different menus displaying different data? You aren’t just stuck with one view per property. Create as many as you want by repeating the steps for creating a new view and you can create many different views that display different information!
Link Google Adsense:
If you also run Adsense on your page, linking Adsense to Google Analytics is an especially useful tool. In the Admin menu, find the property that you want to link to Google Adsense. Then, click Google Ads Linking. From there, click New Link Group, then navigate to the Google Ads account that you want to link. Turn linking ON for every page you want to link to your account, then you’re all set! Just click Link Accounts to begin receiving data from Adsense.
Set up goals:
If there are specific metrics you want to achieve, Analytics makes that super easy with their goals system. What does assigning a value to a Google Analytics goal enable? It allows you to track your performance using metrics. What is a “metric” in Google Analytics? Goals can be defined in 4 types according to Google: destination, duration, pages per session, or event. When a user does any of these things they have met the goal, and you’ll know that a performance metric has been satisfied. Examples include a user navigating to a specific page (such as to track how many people get to the subscribe screen), or if a user stays on your page for 10 minutes.
Frequently Asked Questions:
When will Google Analytics be unable to identify sessions from the same user by default?
When the sessions happen on the same device but in different browsers, Google Analytics will be unable to identify. Not to worry, though, this is extremely rare and isn’t a real concern for accuracy.
When linking a google ads account to Google Analytics, what is not possible?
When linking a Google Ads account to Google Analytics, the biggest missing feature is the inability to adjust keyword bids.
What feature can join offline business systems data with online data collected by Google Analytics?
Data Import. This will allow you to merge the data from your offline business systems with online data collected by Google Analytics.
What is a “dimension” in Google Analytics?
A primary dimension is the dimension set by Google at default. Dimensions allow you to view data by any grouping that Google offers.
What is a “secondary dimension” in Google Analytics?
A secondary dimension is a second dimension specified by the user in Google Analytics.

22,https://www.sageseo.ai/how-important-are-meta-descriptions-in-your-google-seo-ranking-factors/,"Search Engine Journal posted an article about this topic recently that I believe gets it wrong. Their basic premise is that meta descriptions are not a ranking factor when it comes to Google’s search algorithm.
Many of the conclusions the writer of this article comes to are to validate existing SEO theories — mainly, that the description itself is not important and easily manipulated, both by content writers as well as Google themselves.
What is a Meta Description?
A meta description is an HTML tag used by content management systems to describe what a web page is about. This allows search engines to understand the intent of the article and then match that article’s content to a person doing a related search about the topic.
Search engines use this description to provide a preview of the article in search results (SERPs) when a user is looking for information. Our own article’s meta description looks like this:
Normally, SEO plugins and website tools like WordPress, Square Space, Wix, etc, give you the ability to create the meta description and tell the search engine in your own words, what you are writing about. But if no meta description has been specified, search engines will display copy from the page itself as an alternative.
People Matter when it comes to Search Intent
SEJ references articles written in 2009 and 2011 as two primary sources of the conclusions. The biggest evidence is attributed to a study from 2020 that dives into Google re-writing the meta descriptions to more accurately reflect the purpose of the content they are indexing. This is a GOOD thing and not a bad one for both the content creator as well as their audience.
Google wants to make sure your content (and meta descriptions), along with the value it brings to a potential website visitor, are aligned. This is in keeping with their North Star of satisfying user search intent from the search query they type into the box.
Google wants to connect your search query to the content most likely to satisfy your need. And if your description isn’t aligned with the content, then website owners should write better descriptions to better reflect what is behind their links.
If I were interested in learning how important meta descriptions were to my Google rankings, I’d probably click it.
Meta Descriptions Indirectly Affect Your On-Page SEO Metrics
The other big thing to keep in mind is that the description is what humans read when they decide whether to click a link. It’s that tiny blurb you see about the article in the search results (see my comment below with the description for the SEJ article). The more indicative it is of the content behind that link, the more likely your link gets clicked.
Getting a user to click your content link is the first big hurdle. After that, having great content that causes users to stick around and explore your website, products, services, etc, further, is the next big step all businesses must take.
Google Analytics measures all these things with organic traffic counts, bounce rates, average session times, pages/session, etc. The more people click on your link, stay on the page for longer session times to read your content, and then explore more pages within your website, the better it is for your business and the higher you’ll rank.
And guess what? That all comes back to your meta description in search results. Even if your description keywords don’t technically factor into Google’s algorithm (which I doubt), they absolutely indirectly affect the other metrics that do."

As a small business owner, it can be frustrating to pour your limited time and energy into your website only to find that it’s not getting the organic traffic you desire. But fear not! Google has a host of free tools available to help you tackle your SEO and get your website the attention it deserves. From keyword planners to analytics and search console, these tools provide valuable insights and opportunities for optimization. So don’t give up hope just yet – with a little bit of strategy and some help from Google, the path to increased organic traffic may be closer than you think.
SEO is a fantastic way to drive high-quality traffic to your site, and the best part is it doesn’t have to cost a fortune. Google offers several free tools that help with content planning so you can generate the most impactful SEO content ideas for your business.
We’ll dive into them here to help you begin building your SEO strategy.
How to Use Google Ads Keyword Planner To Create Content
Getting started on the keyword hunt can be daunting: there are so many keyword research tools to choose from, and it’s hard to know which will reap the most rewards. For small business owners, time is of the essence, and understanding where to find good data and get your blog off the ground is absolutely essential.
If you’ve spent any time running Google ads for your small business, you’re probably already familiar with the interface. A recent survey from Statista showed that small business owners say they spend an average of $534/month on paid digital advertising for their business. Google’s plans to eliminate 3rd party cookie tracking, though delayed, should still be a strong indicator to you that SEO is a better long-term strategy for your small business SEO.
Make sure you have a keyword research strategy
And one of the best ways to get started with SEO is to have a deliberate strategy for keyword research. But where do you find them, how many can you actually rank for, and will the investment and ROI be worth it to avoid paying those cost-per-click (CPC) fees on your search ads?
As an aside, if you’re new to SEO, take a look at our article “What is an SEO Keyword?” to learn more of the basics.
Now back to our article – of course, it would be great to target major buzzwords, but is it worth it if you don’t really stand a chance against the competition? How do you find the related terms that still have a good search volume but fewer big dogs to go up against?
There are a few options to choose from, but Google Ads Keyword Planner is one of the most popular free ways to conduct keyword research. The user interface is super simple, so you don’t need to learn a whole new skill set just to navigate the platform.
If the link above doesn’t work, you can log into Google Ads Keyword Planner by following these steps:
- Go to the Google Ads website (https://ads.google.com/) and click on the “Sign in” button in the top right corner.
- Enter your Google account login information (email address and password) and click “Next.”
- If you have multiple Google Ads accounts, select the one you want to use from the list. If you only have one account, it will be selected automatically.
- Once you are logged in, click on the “Tools” icon in the top menu and select “Keyword Planner” from the dropdown menu.
- You should now be on the Keyword Planner dashboard. From here, you can enter a search term and find variations of it that have a good search volume but less competition. You can use these variations as inspiration for future content and plug them in as the primary keyword to find even more related topics.
First, enter your ideal search term, the one that might be a little out of reach. For example, we’re creating SEO content, so we might go for “SEO Content Marketing”. It’d be great to rank at the top spot for this term, but that could be very difficult. Still, with Google Keywords you can find variations of your ideal term that will also drive traffic to your site with less competition and potentially even more suited to your business if they’ve searched for a more niche term. For example, “SEO Strategies for Small Businesses”.
Google Keywords will show your primary search term, its average monthly search volume and rank the competition from Low to High if you were to run ads for these keywords. Below this, you’ll find a list of related keywords in order of relevance, top of page low bids and high bids, and seasonality data over three months and twelve months. You can use these as inspiration for future content, plugging in the ones you choose as the primary keyword and uncovering even more related topics for SEO content generation.
Google Keyword Planner is a basic tool, yes, but that’s what makes it so great. It’s a gold mine of content ideas that’s easy and quick to use, and also free.
How to Use Google Analytics for SEO Content Generation
A content marketing strategy will always perform best when you have clear goals in place and monitor their performance. The best way to do this is through tracking in Google Analytics to see where and how often you’re showing up in search engine results and associated statistics.
The Google Analytics dashboard gives you an overview of your performance over a given stretch of time. This will give you an idea of the overall progress of your SEO content marketing strategy – are you trending upwards, or do you need to make some big changes?
Next, you can dive deeper into more specific metrics and look through many of the built-in SEO analytics reporting options available. For example, you can evaluate what your top-performing pages are to see what’s resonating most with your audience, in order to create more content around those topics. Likewise, you can see which pages are least popular, in order to tweak their content to make it more compelling.
Understanding the available reports in Google Analytics
Google Analytics offers a number of additional reports that can be helpful for SEO. Here are a few more to explore in the tool:
- Acquisition Reports: These reports show howa visitors are finding your website, including which channels (such as organic search, paid search, or referral) are bringing the most traffic.
- Behavior Reports: These reports provide information on how visitors are interacting with your website, including what pages they are visiting, how long they are staying on each page, and what actions they are taking (such as filling out a form or making a purchase).
- Conversion Reports: These reports show how well your website is meeting your business goals, such as making a sale or generating a lead.
- Site Search Reports: These reports provide information on the keywords that visitors are using to search within your website, as well as which pages they are clicking on as a result of those searches.
- Landing Pages Report: This report shows which pages on your website are receiving the most traffic and conversions, as well as how well they are performing in terms of bounce rate and average session duration. This is a great report to help evaluate whether your on page content strategy is working.
By analyzing these reports regularly, you can identify areas for improvement and optimize your website for better SEO performance.
How to Use Google Search Console to Generate Content Ideas
Like most of Google’s tools, Google Search Console (GSC), previously Webmaster Tools, is relatively straightforward to use, and yet you could find yourself spending hours combing through its information. The search console dashboard provides a macro website analysis as well as valuable information on a micro level.
Firstly, you’ll have to sign your website up for GSC. Go to the dashboard and select ‘Add a Property’, then select ‘domain’ or ‘URL prefix’ and choose how to verify your domain. We recommend the “Domain” option as this will gather and track data for all your sub-domains and sub-directories on your website. The “URL Prefix” option will only gather data for a specific URL and its associated sub-directories.
A quick cautionary warning to make sure Google is gathering your search data
The major issue with using URL prefixes is that the data for your website could end up in multiple places, and that’s not ideal.
For example, if you add a URL Prefix for “http://www.yourwebsite.com”, then you’ll likely miss all your data if your website is using SSL (which almost all websites do today). You may think you’re tracking your data, but since all website traffic is redirected from your http:// to https://, Google won’t include the https:// traffic. This is a problem and can derail your GSC efforts to learn how Google views your website in search.
You’ve verified your domain with Google Search Console…now what?
Once you’ve verified your domain, Google will then start tracking all the data for your site.
Now that you’ve established yourself, you should monitor a few key sections: Performance, Indexing, and URL Inspection.
Google Search Console is a free tool that allows you to monitor and maintain your website’s presence in Google search results. It has three major components: Performance, Indexing, and URL Inspection.
- Performance: This tool shows you the keywords your website is ranking for, as well as the number of clicks and impressions your website has received for those keywords. It also shows you the average position of your website in the search results, as well as the click-through rate (CTR) and any errors that have been detected.
- Indexing: This tool provides information on how Google is indexing your website, including any crawl errors that have been detected and the status of your sitemap. It also allows you to submit individual URLs for crawling, which can be helpful if you have recently made changes to a page and want it to be indexed as soon as possible.
- URL Inspection: This tool allows you to check the index status of a specific URL on your website and see if it has any issues that may be preventing it from being properly indexed. It also provides information on the last time the URL was crawled, any crawl errors that have been detected, and any enhancements that have been applied to the page.
As you can see, performance shows you what pages and keywords your website is ranking for. Check it regularly to see which keywords are doing well and which need a little more attention. Indexing is a little more technical but extremely important. It’ll show you how many of your pages have been indexed by Google making them available to rank in searches. The URL Inspection section is all about making sure your site is well-indexed. The Google Search Console crawl reports let you monitor like when Google crawled specific URLS and what the page looked like then. It helps you make sure Google can efficiently crawl your site to get your new content indexed in results quickly.
By regularly checking these tools and addressing any issues that are identified, you can ensure that your website is performing well in Google search results.
Google Trends
Google Keyword planner is a great tool for big-picture thinking, but sometimes you’ll want to jump ahead of the rush of traffic by writing about new and trending topics. Google Trends is an often underrated content strategy tool in that regard. Get in the habit of using it to brainstorm new blog ideas in accordance with what’s performing well at any given moment.
This tool helps you see what’s trending so you can factor that into your website content planning and put yourself front and center as an influx of searches come your way. You can tailor it to specific regions of the world to make your content more specific, too.
Try to blend this trending topic with your usual niche of choice in order to capture high-quality leads while also harnessing the trajectory of a trending topic. Say you’re a social media management business, and everybody’s talking about Spotify Wrapped right now; you can create content around How to Create Spotify-Wrapped Themed Content for Social Media and encourage people to create their own Business Wrapped.
Learning which topics are trending (Rising in Google Trends parlance), and what regions of the country or world to focus your digital marketing is another huge piece of the puzzle that this tool can help with:
Google Alerts
Google Alerts is the perfect way to eavesdrop on where you or your topic of choice are being mentioned on the internet. It allows you to monitor the web to tune into the most relevant conversations so that you, too, can jump on the bandwagon.
It’ll send you an email every day or every week, as you choose, notifying you of where your keywords have been mentioned. That way, you can keep abreast of trending content without trawling the internet yourself and spending unnecessary time on social media.
Set alerts for your brand/company name to know what people are saying about you, as well as your most relevant keywords in order to ideate content around what’s hot right now.

Sounds pretty cool, right? Ready to get started? I know I am! Let’s go!
What is a Target Audience?
We should start with the answer to this question because it’s critical foundational knowledge before we begin. And it’s also not necessarily obvious.
Your target audience are the people you most want to attract to your website. That’s it. That’s the only thing you care about when executing an SEO strategy. How do I get more people to my website who care about what I do and how I can help them.
These are the potential customers that are most likely to do something meaningful for your business…whether that’s joining your email list, scheduling a demo, or making an e-commerce purchase.
When it comes to SEO, you’ll want to target potential customers that are using search engines to find solutions that your business provides. The better you understand your customer through industry analysis, blog research, competitor analysis, etc, the more easily your content will resonate.
The more specific you get about what sort of person you want to visit your site, the more you can narrow the focus of your SEO content strategy to build engagement with this audience and attract potential leads.
The most common characteristics to consider for your target audience are:
- Gender
- Age
- Location
- Purchasing power
- Consumption habits
- Social class
- Highest level of education
Why do you need to define your target audience
In the simplest terms, if you attract people that are most interested in what you do, they will convert into sales at higher rates.
More deliberately, defining your target audience allows you to be as accurate as possible with your strategy, making your SEO performance more successful in the long run. The more effective you are at consumer targeting for your target audience, the more accurately you can:
- Identify hyper-relevant search terms during keyword research and optimize your site accordingly
- Generate content that’s highly specialized to attract them
- Drive high-quality traffic to your site
- Convert more of your organic traffic into leads or sales
Without further ado, let me take you through how to do customer research to find target audience intel for your small business and share our tried and tested tips for improving your outcomes with targeted marketing.
Understand your current customer
Some of the best intel you can get comes from analyzing the people who’ve already decided to convert, aka your current customers. You’re looking for more people like them, so they should be your first point of reference.
Evaluate the data within your CRM to find information on their demographic, customer journey, purchases, and preferences to figure out who is your highest converting customer. This will help determine what type of person you should be targeting.
You can also find such valuable information on Google Analytics. Take a look at the ‘Audience’ tab to find their demographic, interests, geographical data, and more. You might find that the audience your site is most popular with is not what you expected, and you can adapt your strategy to match the insights you gain.
You could also target competitors that make similar products as you using competitor analysis tools like SEMRush or Ahrefs.
Get to know them really well
Now that you have a rough idea of who they are, you want to get to know them as well as possible. Most importantly, you want to solve customer pain points around your topics, so you can swoop in and offer to solve them.
How do you identify customer pain points?
Your first attempt at understanding customer pain points should be a deep dive into the inner workings of their minds via internet forums and places where your target customers tend to congregate. One of the main advantages of technology is free and instant access to peoples’ thoughts and opinions far and wide.
Online forums like Reddit can be gold mines in terms of understanding your target customer’s opinions and emotions. Search for questions around your key topics, and you’ll likely find tens if not hundreds of answers relating to your industry, and maybe even your product, specifically.
Don’t just take note of what they’re saying, but of how they’re saying it, too. The way they speak and express themselves is a good springboard for establishing what tone of voice to use in order to be relatable and accessible to your target audience.
Next, try reaching out to your customers directly – there’s no better avenue for identifying customer pain points straight from the horse’s mouth. You can do this by sending out an email to your newsletter subscribers with a link to a survey that reveal customer pain points or, even better, requesting a short phone conversation with them. A 20 to 30-minute conversation will allow you to gather rich information and paint a realistic picture of what your customers are like and what really makes them tick.
With your intel from online forums and your interviews, you can make a list of customer pain points from which to brainstorm potential SEO content ideas.
Analyze Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs)
When it comes to defining your target audience, analyzing SERPs is a crucial step. Simply taking time to run searches around your most lucrative keywords is worth every minute. It might sound simple, but spending time analyzing the SERPs for related terms will help you see what’s performing best with your target audience and for your target search terms.
What are the common themes throughout the main results? What tone of voice are these pieces of content using? What type of articles are ranking in positions 1-5? Your answers will help you determine who your target audience should be and the type of content to write. Is the content generally informational or transactional?
This will helps you identify their search intent – in other words, what action someone is trying to take when they search that term. You need to match your content to the searcher’s intent.
Utilize social insights
Your following on social media is a great snapshot of the people who are interested in your products or services and want to keep up to date with your latest updates.
Take a plunge into the insights of your Facebook and Instagram pages to learn more about the audience you already have. Here, you can gather data to supplement what you’ll collect from your CRM and Google Analytics to create a better understanding of all the people who are interested in your content. Bear in mind that your social following doesn’t necessarily translate to conversion, but it’s a good indicator of who’s interested in what you’re sharing. If that doesn’t match the demographic of who actually converts to sales, that’s also valuable information as to how you can switch up your strategy.
Know your competitors well
Perhaps surprisingly, SEO strategy is one arena where the age-old cliché “keep your friends close and your enemies closer” applies quite well. A deep knowledge of the competitive landscape will be instrumental in propelling yourself to the top, especially if your business lies in a particularly competitive market.
By evaluating what’s working well for your competitors, you can figure out what’s most compelling to your target audience. Ask yourself the same questions as you would when looking over the SERPs – pay attention to how they speak to the reader, how long their content pieces are and how they create a connection between the target keyword and the page that’s working.
Final Thoughts
The most important metric of your SEO strategy’s success is how well it’s performing with the right people. Defining who they are – the ones who are ready to take the plunge and convert to loyal customers – and tailoring your strategy to their tastes is vital to acquiring high-quality traffic that boosts your bottom line in the long run.
And don’t worry, finding your target audience is very doable! By analyzing your current customers and evaluating data from your CRM, you can get a better understanding of their demographics, purchase habits, and preferences. From there, you can create a strategy that targets the right people and drives more conversions.
By following the simple steps we’ve outlined, you’ll be well on your way to harnessing the power of SEO to take your business to the next level. Plus, with the help of affordable search engine optimization services like Sage SEO, the cost of SEO for small businesses is no longer a worry."
26,https://www.sageseo.ai/how-to-verify-your-domain-with-google-search-console/,"Getting your website verified with Google Search Console is an important first step to understanding and measuring how your SEO efforts are performing. Without proper data and tracking, you’ll often be left wondering if you’re making any progress at all with your content marketing strategy.
Is it working? Are you getting visitors? Why aren’t you getting visitors?
Google Search Console has all the data you’re looking for and acts as the early indicator of a well-executed SEO strategy.
If you’re using Wix or Squarespace or another website provider and just kicking off your SEO journey, you’ll likely be prompted to “verify your domain” in Google Search Console. You’ve come to the right place to get this done.
If you’ve just stumbled upon this article because someone told you Google Search Console is important, you’ve also come to the right place.
Let’s go!
What is Google Search Console?
If you’re a modern website owner, chances are you’ve heard about how powerful Google’s Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and analytical tools are. One such tool is Google Search Console (GSC).
GSC is a powerful tool that acts as an early indicator of how your SEO efforts are performing. For most business website owners, Google Analytics has become the go to analytics tool for monitoring and measuring website performance.
But if you’re not using Google Search Console, you’re missing a treasure trove of information that provides much more relevant information to how your website is performing in Google search results.
Getting started with Google Search Console SEO
If you’ve just launched a new website or are updating your old one, you’ll want to verify your domain on Google Search Console as quickly as possible. Doing so connects your website with Google Search and other services that crawl the internet for content.
GSC allows you to keep tabs on how your website ranks in search, what SEO keywords your website content appears for, and how many search impressions your website receives each month. These Google Search Console crawl reports let you monitor statistics like how many requests were made and when, along with your server response times, and any availability issues encountered.
Setting up your GSC account can be tricky if you’ve got a custom domain name rather than a regular subdomain or subfolder of your main site, but that’s why we’re here.
What is google search console ownership verification?
Google Search Console verification is necessary to guarantee that you own the website you are working on. When you add a site in GSC, you’ll have access to sensitive Google Search data about your website and how you’re performing in Google search.
If you’d like, other individuals may be authorized to see or manage site data in Search Console if you are verified as the owner. Adding a user to google search console is easy to do in the Settings menu on the left hand side of the tool.
How to verify site ownership
There are several ways to verify your ownership with Google Search Console:
- Adding a DNS Record – Creating a new TXT entry in your provider DNS
- HTML File Upload – upload a small HTML file to your root HTML directory
- HTML Tag – Add an HTML tag to your raw website content
- Google Analytics Tracking Code – Verify your ownership via your Google Analytics account tag
- Google Tag Manager container snippet – Connect your Google Tag Manager account
- Google Sites – If you’ve created your website using Google Sites
- Blogger – If your website is built on the blogger platform
We’re going to focus on #1, adding a DNS record to your website provider. This is one of the most reliable ways to do it and the one we recommend.
Before beginning, ensure each of these Google Search Console “setup” items are checked off:
Remove your site-wide password(s)
If you have a site-wide or homepage password, remove them both. Passwords prevent Google from indexing your content
Ensure your domain is connected to your hosting service properly
If you use a third-party domain, make sure it’s properly connected to your website hosting service like Squarespace. It’s best to wait at least 72 hours after connecting your domain before verifying it with Google Search Console to avoid any dependency issues.
Verify that your site is live
Trial sites are hidden from search engines so verification won’t work on them. If you have a trial site, publish it before continuing.
The Step-By-Step for Verifying Google Search Console with a TXT Record:
- Open up Google Search Console
- Click on ‘Add Property.’
- It’ll be on the left side panel if you’re already in your GSC Dashboard. Otherwise, it will look like this:
- Choose the ‘Domain’ option by entering your domain name
- Click ‘Continue’
- Ensure the instructions are set to ‘Any DNS provider.’
- GSC will provide you with a domain verification TXT record. Copy it and make sure you don’t lose it for the time being (ours is censored, yours will look complete).
- Log into your website’s domain provider. Find your various hosts here for tailored instructions. For example, these are the steps that Google provides for Bluehost:
- Open Bluehost (or your host) and sign in with the account you used to buy your domain
- Next to the domain you’re setting up, click the ‘Manage’ down arrow and select ‘DNS.’
8. Scroll to ‘TXT’ (text) and click ‘Add record.’
9. Fill out the form
- Enter @ in the Host record field
- Paste the verification code you copied from the setup tool into the TXT value field
- Click ‘Save’
10. Return to the browser tab where the Google Workspace setup tool is open. (You can reopen the tool if you’ve closed it.)
11. On the page where you copied your verification code, scroll to the bottom and click ‘Verify.’
12. You’ll likely run into an error, warning you your Google Search Console domain property couldn’t be verified. Don’t worry! This is completely normal. Wait about 20 minutes to an hour and try again.
Once your DNS entry has propagated to the worldwide DNS system, you’ll see a message like this after clicking google search console verify:
No matter what host you use, the steps will be extremely similar. If you have any issues, consult your hosts’ documentation and Google’s tailored instructions for tutorials like ‘How to verify your domain on WordPress.’
In case you have any lingering questions, here are some FAQs from Google’s Site Ownership Support Page.
How long does verification last?
Verification lasts as long as Search Console can confirm your verification token through periodic checks. If GSC can’t verify your domain token, you will be notified, and if not fixed, your permissions on that property will expire after a set grace period. We recommend checking up on your website’s back-end housekeeping often!
When will I start to see data?
Data is collected for a verified domain property as soon as anyone adds it to the Search Console, even before it’s verified. However, it takes a few days for data to start to accumulate for your domain.
Once you’ve successfully verified your domain, you’re off to the races! Next up, you can learn to use GSC’s sitemap and analytics features! Learning how to set up Google Search Console can be a little overwhelming at first, so check out our blog for more tutorials on how to use google search console and the various ways to use google search console for seo."
27,https://www.sageseo.ai/is-the-roi-on-seo-worth-the-money/,"When you search for “SEO ROI” on Google you find a number of straightforward articles about how to calculate the value of your investment, most of which boil down to the simple “divide your profits by your costs.” If you are trying to decide if you should invest in SEO at all, this is spectacularly unhelpful. In this article, I try to get down to the essential factors you should consider when exploring SEO. My list has six items on it – if I’ve missed anything, please leave a comment below!
Six things you’ll want to consider about SEO ROI:
Time to Value
Time vs Money when creating content – DIY vs Pay a Professional
Importance of your website to generating leads/sales
Ability to track web traffic
Tracking Your Conversions
Competitors’ strategies
Time to Value
You’ve heard that it takes time to get results with SEO. How long does it take for SEO vs SEM? You can pay for ads and get results immediately, while optimizing for search is going to take three to six months, at least, to show results. What this means for you as a business owner is that you must be willing to pay, upfront, for benefits that you won’t realize immediately. That’s one major reason SEO is such a difficult choice for so many small business owners; money is always tight, and the margin of error is so small.
Why does SEO take so long? That’s another article, but the short version is search engines like Google prioritize content published from established domains/websites. It takes time to build up trust in a new website, and trust is established by consistently creating content relevant to your target audience. The upside is that SEO delivers results long after you’ve created your content. Stop paying for ads, and traffic from ads stops, immediately. High-quality content will bring customers to your site for years after it has been posted.
Do It Yourself (DIY) or hire someone to do your SEO for you?
Let’s look at the DIY side first. What does it take to DIY SEO?
For SEO to work, you’ll need to post high-quality content, regularly. This allows search engines to recognize you as an authority who should be trusted. Expect to spend 4 hours a week writing excellent, helpful articles that inform readers and build trust. If that’s not possible, you’ll need to find someone who can create exactly that kind of content for you.
Whether you write yourself or contract that out, you will need to plan your SEO campaign. Your goal is to build rankings around the keywords and phrases that will bring the right traffic to your site, and ensure that excellent keyword research is informing the content.
Keyword research ensures you understand which phrases people use when they are searching for what you are selling. Don’t misunderstand; this is about ensuring you don’t miss potential customers, and not about “how many SEO keywords should I use.”
There are many tools for SEO research; they are built for marketing professionals, not casual users. Most have a free or inexpensive entry-level tier, though, which gives you some access to the wealth of knowledge they contain. When you factor in teaching yourself new tools, creating content, and managing your website’s technical elements, you can spend a lot of time on SEO.
Backlinks are another element search engines consider when they rank your site – how many other trustworthy sites are linking to you? Building a network of backlinks is time-consuming and can be expensive; most DIY SEO efforts rely on creating excellent, link-worthy content to generate backlinks.
What does professional search engine optimization entail?
SEO was a $50 billion business in 2021, so if you are asking “does SEO really work” then that number alone should be the answer. SEO agencies can handle everything: keyword research, content creation, technical optimization, and securing backlinks. Agencies will generally require a six-month (or longer) contract, and you can expect to pay from $3,500 – $10,000 per month, depending on the agency. You’ll get a personal representative backed by a team to manage your SEO; the best agencies will work closely with you to ensure that you get full value for your money.
Not enough time, not enough money.
This is the fundamental challenge of SEO today for startups and small businesses – it takes too much time to DIY, and costs too much to pay the professionals. Agencies can charge as much as they do because 1) SEO has a lot of moving parts, and 2) the ROI can be tremendous. Would you spend $50,000 to increase your sales by $250,000? Of course, you would – if you knew for a fact that it was going to work. Turn that around and ask if you’d spend 100 hours of work to increase your sales by $250,000? Again, of course, you would! But the risk that you spend that time or money and don’t see the returns is hard to quantify.
There is a new and growing middle ground: Sage SEO makes SEO affordable, approachable, and easy. Sage SEO is a great way to get started when you are looking for organic traffic – they do a lot of the heavy lifting while providing you with the tools you need to understand how SEO works.
Importance of your website to generating leads/sales
For some businesses, their website is the place where they make most of their money. Other businesses just have an online presence as a formality and don’t need to worry about driving traffic there. SEO shines with businesses that solve problems – problems that people search for solutions to. On the small end, think about a local brick-and-mortar pizza parlor; they need to own their local SEO, so that when someone searches for “pizza near me” they are at the top of the page. Larger businesses that solve problems through software also want to be on the front page for their solution – think tax preparation software. In the USA every April there’s a rush to google ‘Free online tax returns’, and you can bet that companies like TurboTax and H&R Block spend a lot of money on SEO to try to get the first result.
On the other hand are companies that have very niche industries, like military hardware, or medical device manufacturers. A good rule of thumb here is “if you don’t need your website to make money, don’t spend money on your website.” If you just need a place for people to find your contact information and possibly post news releases and job openings, then the answer to the question “should I invest in SEO” is no.
If, on the other hand, you get leads from your website, or sell your product through your website, then SEO is something you want to think about. Where do your customers come from?
Do they find you because they are searching for your brand name?
Try to own the top spot on google for your brand name.
Do they find you because they are searching for what you do?
Try to own the top spots on google for commonly used search terms (keywords)
Do they find you because they search for who you are?
Try to own the top spot on google for your name, profession, or personal accomplishments
These are all areas where SEO can be worth the investment. If your customer profiles don’t fall into one of these categories, then SEO is probably not the right go-to-market strategy for you.
Ability to track web traffic
With social media advertising, you get some feedback immediately – how many people are clicking, and how much you’re paying per click. To calculate the ROI of SEO accurately, you need to do a lot more work. Unlike PPC (for example), SEO doesn’t have fixed costs associated with it, so you’ll need to know, in detail, how people are moving through your website on their way to making a purchase. Imagine that someone comes to your site via a google search, reads an article or two, checks out your offerings, but doesn’t make a purchase. When that same person returns (typing your company’s URL directly into their browser) how that sale is attributed will be different if you can’t identify them as a returning visitor. At first glance, that sale would look like it came ‘direct,’ when in fact it was the organic search that brought them to you in the first place.
Ask yourself – do I already have that level of nuanced understanding of my customer’s behavior? And if the answer is no, prepare to acquire it, or you’ll be on the road to frustration with your SEO strategy. Many business owners have said something like “It’s been six months, and I guess we’re ranking higher on google for some keywords and we have more web traffic, but how do you know those people are coming because of SEO?” It’s beyond the scope of this article to walk you through how to do this, but Google Analytics is your friend here.
Tools like Google Analytics help you understand the various ways that customers find your website. Did they come from a social media post? an email campaign? paid ads? an organic search? Are they a returning visitor from 2 months ago and were waiting on more revenue before investing in your product or service? What pages did they browse on your website that led to the conversion or sale?
In fact, what is a conversion for you? I’m glad you asked.
Tracking your Conversions
If you take one thing and only one thing away from reading this article, it’s that tracking your conversion data is the make-or-break step of any business website.
The first step is understanding what a conversion is for your business. Here are a few common ones to consider:
Signing up for an email list
Scheduling a demo
Subscribing to paid content
Purchasing a software subscription
Downloading a case study or eBook
All of these actions are conversions for your website content. They all lead directly to product sales or to further qualifying marketing and sales leads for your business.
Scheduling a demo is an obvious path toward a sale but having a customer provide you with their email address is also a conversion. This gives you an opportunity to send them more information about your product or service and build trust along the way.
A direct sale of your product or your software subscription is the holy grail of any website landing page. As a business, you need to understand how many sales you’re getting and from which acquisition channel they are coming. This provides you with critical data so you can invest more into the acquisition channels that are converting and less in the ones that don’t work for your business.
The tools to track this are largely free but require some ramp-up if you aren’t working with a software company like Sage SEO or a professional. Take a look at Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, and Google Ad Words to understand the types of conversion data available to you.
Competitors strategies
The final thing I’d suggest is that you look at the websites of your main competitors. You know who they are. Are they posting blogs on a regular schedule? Does their website load quickly, and work as well on mobile as it does on desktop? Does their site have a clear architecture, with easy-to-follow links and easy-to-understand calls to action that stand out from the content? If they do and you don’t, then you are definitely losing opportunities to them from organic traffic. If they don’t, then two questions arise:
Why don’t they? Is the vertical you are in one that doesn’t lend itself to SEO?
Is this an opportunity to take market share from them, by utilizing SEO before they do?
As I noted above, there are definitely verticals where SEO isn’t the right route to market – while being on the front page of google is nice, it can be a vanity metric unless it is adding to the bottom line.
Final Thoughts
When you decide on SEO as a strategy, you’re committing your time and money for a year. If you invest in the planning phase by
learning what keywords are most important to your long-term business goals,
understanding what your customers are looking for when they come to your site,
being clear about how what you are selling solves their problem, and
Investing in the infrastructure required to track visitors closely
then you can get the most out of your SEO investment. Remember that SEO requires discipline and attention to detail over time! While it will take months to realize value, it can deliver that value for years. If you’re still not sure about SEO for your business, schedule a meeting with Sage SEO. We’ll be happy to get on a call, look at your business and use case, and advise if SEO is right for you."
28,https://www.sageseo.ai/mailchimp-guide-to-marketing-more-efficiently/,"With the rise of e-Commerce, digital marketing has become more important than ever. Email marketing is now a necessity, but it can be difficult to begin without help. With our Mailchimp guide, you can become an email marketing superstar!
What is Mailchimp? It’s a simple tool that lets you create powerful digital marketing campaigns through contact management, campaign design, and data analytics. Put simply, it manages your newsletters and makes sure your audience gets the material you put out. If you’re wondering how to use Mailchimp, have no fear! Today, we’ll go over how to get started with MailChimp so you can grow your business best.
About Mailchimp
Mailchimp is an online, web-based program, which means that it can be used on any device, from an iPhone to a workstation. To get it working, enable cookies, pop-ups, and JavaScript.
How much does Mailchimp cost? Mailchimp pricing is free for the first 2,000 contacts and 10,000 emails per month (5 emails per contact), but limits features. Essentials costs $9.99 per month for 500 contacts and 500,000 emails. The Standard plan at $14.99 unlocks advanced automation, and Premium gives you unlimited features for $299/month.
Signing Up
To create an account you’ll need an email, a username, and a password. Hit sign up to get started! Activate your account through an email they’ll send to you (don’t forget to check spam!), then log in to Mailchimp through their website.
You’ll be greeted with the Mailchimp login page, where you’ll need to enter your website, address, and social media accounts. You can also connect your online storefront to MailChimp if you sell online!
Audience Creation
Your email contact list will be the heart of your Mailchimp account, but have no fear. Mailchimp will help you build that list through its audience management system. When you create your account, a questionnaire will automatically generate your audience type for you, to better aid your search for subscribers. You can edit this automatically generated information, of course, or you can immediately start importing emails into Mailchimp.
You can split your subscribers into many different audiences, so they can receive specially-tailored content as well, which makes Mailchimp very powerful even at scale.
Audience Signup
Even if you start with no subscribers, Mailchimp will help you grow your audience. They’ll automatically generate a signup form, so you can post on social media and start right away! They have a simply but powerful custom signup tool that can be used to create YOUR desired look, so fire away!
To use this feature:
- Click the icon labeled Audience in the sidebar.
- Click “Audience dashboard”.
- Select “Signup forms”, then hit the dropdown menu near “Stats”.
- From the menu, select “Signup form”.
- Then, tap the “Form builder” and select the “Design it” tab to begin customizing!
The Page, Body, Forms, and Referral tabs will manage separate pieces of your signup form, so don’t be afraid to experiment with just one part at a time. When you’re done customizing your form, don’t forget to hit “Save & Close” to save your changes!
Creating a Campaign
Mailchimp refers to any message that you share via social media, email, etc. as a campaign, but for this introduction we’ll focus on the most common Mailchimp application: eMail campaigns.
- Click the “Create” button on the sidebar.
- Click “eMail”.
- Name your campaign, then tap “Begin”.
From here, you can design any campaign! Mailchimp offers a classic and new builder, with the classic offering more power at the expense of a less intuitive interface. To get started, we’d recommend using a template that Mailchimp creates for you. By picking one of Mailchimp’s many themes, you can simply fill out your information into the boxes, without having to worry about design!
Viewing Campaign Reports
After you’ve sent out your campaign, Mailchimp will keep track of audience engagement through its campaign reports. Click “Reports” to find information on how many of your subscribers opened, clicked, or unsubscribed from your eMails, their geolocation, etc..
You can integrate Google Analytics with Mailchimp for further statistics on your subscriber base! Furthermore, Mailchimp uses smart systems to figure out which contacts aren’t valid. For those wondering what does cleaned mean in Mailchimp, a cleaned email is one who Mailchimp has identified as being dead, and will no longer send campaigns to.
Advanced Features
Ads:
Mailchimp can easily facilitate ad campaigns by becoming your hub for buying. Mailchimp charges no additional fees, and can easily facilitate outreach to Google Adsense, Facebook, and other advertising giants!
Automation:
If you have a content pipeline that works well in advance of a scheduled campaign, you can easily set Mailchimp to release targeted emails triggered by date, subscriber activity, or event so you can save even more time!
Developer Tools:
If you are familiar with APIs, Mailchimp API offers API 3.0 compatibility. If you;ve wondering how to get Mailchimp API key, Mailchimp API key access can be generated on their website.
Mailchimp Landing Page:
While you presumably already have an online presence, Mailchimp can help you develop or create an amazing landing page by integrating its features into your website!
Postcards:
Mailchimp doesn’t just offer digital services. They can also print postcards which can be sent to subscribers with a known address. If you’re interested in standing out physical marketing can be the thing that makes a difference!"
29,https://www.sageseo.ai/mailshake-beginners-guide-level-up-your-marketing/,"Cold email marketing campaigns are one of the most important aspects of your business. When it comes to finding new customers, cold emailing automation can mean the difference between 100 sales and 10,000 sales. Mailshake can make sure that your business reaches the people it needs to to succeed. It’s intuitive, quick, it makes sense. In this Mailshake beginners’ guide we’ll teach you how to get started so that you can grow your business!
Who should use Mailshake?
Before we begin, you have to decide in Mailshake is right for your business. We’ll go over a quick review of its pros and cons so you can make an educated decision as to whether or not to pay for this service.
Let’s start with the positives: Mailshake has a really clean and user-friendly interface, and is easy to scale up to whatever size your business is. It automatically compiles reports that offer a wealth of features so you can see opens, clicks, replies, and more. You can also quickly compare campaigns so you can see what strategies work and which don’t.
It has great quality-of-life features like automatically removing duplicates and automation support that lets you automate your outreach, follow-up, periodic newsletters, etc. Moreover, its library of high-quality templates and speedy customer service makes it super efficient to use. Lastly, the price is very affordable, which means that these features come at less cost to you.
That doesn’t mean Mailshake is perfect, however, as there are a few cons to keep in mind. Firstly, it doesn’t work with Google Sheets, only CSV files. This means that importing contacts isn’t as efficient as other competitors. Secondly, unsubscribe lists are less efficient than competitors like GMass’ Suppress Lists. These detriments may mean that there’s a more efficient solution if those two features are critical to your business. The biggest asterisk on Mailshake, however, is that it is PURELY an email campaign tool. You still need to produce the prospect list. You still need to find contact information, and you still need to present the data in a format that Mailshake can comprehend.
I’m ready to start using Mailshake! What should I do?
The first step is to sign up for an account! Head to Mailshake.com and input some information about you and your business and you can begin!
You need to enroll in a Mailshake pricing plan to get started, and there are two options: the eMail Outreach plan ($59/month) and the Sales Engagement plan ($99/month).
The key difference is that the Sales Engagement plan unlocks phone tools that enable advanced outreach, whereas the eMail Outreach plan solely focuses on email creation tools.
Getting Registered:
After you finish creating your account, you’re taken to your dashboard. We’ll show you how to get started by creating your first email marketing campaign!
Dashboard:
You should start by connecting your gmail account. This lets Mailshake start sending emails out! Then, click “Campaigns” from the sidebar to get started. Click the big “New Campaign” button to get taken to the content creation interface.
Create a Campaign:
In the Basic tab, you can assign your campaign a title, assign employees to the task, and connect a mail account to send your campaign from.
Lead Catcher:
The Lead Catcher dropdown lets you control what happens when prospects become leads. This can be set to occur when the prospect opens, clicks, or replies to an email.
Syncing APIs:
The Sync to Apps dropdown will allow you to connect other integrated software to Mailshake. This includes any major email provider like Gmail or Outlook, social media like Facebook and LinkedIn, etc. The possibilities are endless!
Prospects:
The next step in creating a killer email campaign is the Prospects tab. You can add prospects from a CSV file, manually enter them, import from the mobile app, or use a preexisting list that’s already been uploaded to another campaign.
The Review Prospects tab will let you double-check your imported prospects list.
Then, the “Sending Settings” tab allows you to control what happens when a prospect opens your email.
Sequencing Emails:
The next tab over is Sequence. You can create your own email, or use one of Mailshake’s wonderful templates to get the look you want. Here, we’ve selected an email template, and with the text in place we’re ready to send.
Finally, confirming this campaign will let you begin!
It’s that easy to begin a campaign with Mailshake. We hope this guide has been helpful and we look forward to seeing your success with this awesome tool!"
30,https://www.sageseo.ai/more-traffic-doesnt-necessarily-mean-more-engaged-users/,"It’s January, and everyone is looking back at what worked, what didn’t, and what to do this year with their marketing. I wanted to share a success story from one of our customers who achieved a significant increase in revenue over the past 12 months with Sage SEO.
We were doing this for one of our customers to report back the ROI of their investment, and the numbers were astoundingly positive.
But one thing jumped out at us and exemplified the point that all website traffic is not created equal.
To set the table – before working with Sage SEO, this particular business didn’t have a content strategy in place…no blogs at all. After starting with us and increasing their average monthly content output to only two posts, they started seeing results within just a couple of months, and those results continued over the next twelve months.
What kind of results…how about a 73.9% increase in revenue from organic traffic, from $228,262 to $396,860. This is purely income from traffic that came to the site via Google organic search clicks.
How did they manage that? The biggest factor was an increase in their conversion rate from organic clicks, which rose from 1.64% to 4.30%.
But I think the best part of the story is that traffic to their site actually DECREASED year over year – from 705,997 to 380,760. When you have a good SEO strategy, you get the right people to visit your site!
Before working with Sage, most visitors were “low engagement,” only coming to the site to realize that it wasn’t really what they were looking for.
Bottom line? The return on investment for SEO was 23.4x. For every $1 spent with Sage, they realized more than $23 in business.
Results are the elusive purpose of SEO. For so long, SEO ROI was too difficult to calculate, and that’s why businesses continue to turn to paid advertising, where those calculations are much simpler. But at Sage SEO, we’re building the tools necessary to show ROI numbers like those above.
I’m confident that the more powerful our toolset becomes, the more obvious it will be that SEO is a much better long-term digital marketing strategy than paid ads."

32,https://www.sageseo.ai/ranking-up-day-1/,"SEO is hard to do.
That’s what we all hear. It’s how any good marketing agency’s sales pitch might begin. Everyone tells you it takes 12-18 months, even if you know what you’re doing, and you execute a great SEO strategy.
SEO experts will tell you not to DIY your own SEO strategy. They’ll say that the DIY SEO tools are too hard to use. They don’t generate results, and you end up paying an arm and leg for them with no obvious ROI from your efforts.
They are all right. Or at least they were. The story people always tell you of “DIY SEO is too difficult to do” is very much a 2021 problem. And this is 2023.
A new approach to SEO
What’s changed? The entrance of Sage SEO into the world to help small businesses do exactly that…DIY their SEO.
By way of introduction, Sage SEO has been around for almost 18 months. We’re a startup that helps small businesses and startups run compelling and effective content marketing strategies through the use of powerful and easy-to-use software tools that are powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). In essence, we help you DIY your SEO but make it much easier than if you were off in the DIY jungle of SEO tools. Trust me, I was there two years ago, and it was unpleasant.
So why the blog and the whole “Day 1” title? Well, even though we’ve been active for a while, we’ve only recently started our own SEO journey by kicking off our content marketing strategy for ourselves. While we’re not technically on day 1, we’re most certainly in the infancy of the SEO process for our website.
Our first piece of content on SEO for small businesses was published just six weeks ago on December 17th, 2022.
I thought it might be fun to share our SEO journey with our customers, blog readers, and anyone else who wants to follow along to hopefully learn about both our successes and our failures. We’ll incorporate the learnings from both into our software and our methodologies.
First things first, let’s start with a metrics baseline of how we were doing in November of 2022 and then see how this compares to each subsequent month afterward. Obviously, our goal is to rank highly for search terms that are relevant to SEO software, small business SEO, and DIY SEO.
Our beginning SEO metrics –
The old adage that you have to start somewhere is an apt one here. We have a bit of what I would call SEO baggage when it comes to our website content. I’ll get into that more in the next article and discuss some of the cleanup we’re doing to make sure our website is optimized for ranking highly for relevant search terms to our business.
There are a few important SEO metrics that we monitor for both ourselves and our customers. These metrics help us determine what our current SEO state of affairs is, as well as how our content marketing efforts are doing to improve that baseline.
Here is a quick list:
- Total search impressions: this number represents how many times any single page from our website appeared in a Google search result and was included on the search engine results page (SERP)
- Top Ranked Keywords: how many keywords a domain is ranked for in the Top 100 search results
- Organic Traffic: how many website visitors we receive to https://sageseo.ai via an organic search click
- Top search queries: how many of the top search queries (ordered by search impressions) are relevant to our business; as mentioned above, for Sage SEO, those terms would be things that include DIY SEO, small business(es), etc
With those qualifications in mind, here is a look at our November stats.
1. Total Search Impressions – November 2022
You can see that our search impressions for queries with “SEO” in the month of November are almost 6,000, a respectable number. But search queries that include “small business” are basically non-existent. We have some work to do.
2. Top 100 Ranked Keywords – November 2022
Similarly, you can see our ranked keywords for important search terms are also starting very low at only 38 in the top 100. In addition, most of those keywords are very low in the rankings as you can see below.
A deeper look shows we rank for only one search term in the top 3 and one more in the 11-20 range of Google search results. A total of 36 are in the 21-100 range, which means we aren’t getting any organic traffic at all from them.
3. Organic Search Traffic – November 2022
Speaking of, let’s take a quick look at our top-performing SEO content pages. We’ve left off all of our old tech-torial content here as it’s not relevant to our business and is being cleaned up and removed from our website.
4. Top Search Queries – November 2022
Below, we’ve broken down our overall top 10 search queries along with our search queries that include “SEO” and “small business”, respectively.
The important thing to note here is that you don’t see a single search query containing any keywords that are relevant to our business. This means that all traffic that results from those clicks is very unlikely to convert into any meaningful action on our website.
Someone searching for “reset google nest” isn’t looking to sign up for SEO services. So this is a problem we need to start addressing immediately.
If you look at our search terms with “small business” in them, they are all pointing back to our articles about setting up Wix or Squarespace. The impression numbers are also quite low. And we don’t even have a “top 10”. We only had 5 search terms that include “small business” in them. Yikes.
You can also see we’re getting search queries for SEO terms but most have no meaningful “search intent” behind them. It’s very hard to determine what people are trying to find when they search for terms like verify SEO.
We need to show up in search results for some meaningful queries ASAP! Don’t worry. We have a plan!
Final Thoughts
One of my key takeaways is just how important it is to have a content strategy that aligns with your business. The more distance between your content approach vs. your business’s product or service, the harder it is for Google to decide what to rank you for and which visitors to send to your website.
A good DIY approach is going to help identify those topics through a combination of data, your subject matter expertise, and a little bit of help from artificial intelligence.

You might think Search Engine Optimization is something of a dark art – complicated, arcane, best left to professionals. There is a kernel of truth to that, but that’s no reason you can’t understand what SEO is trying to accomplish. In this article, I’m going to break down how search engines work, and why websites need to be optimized for search engines like Google. I’m not going to get into the technical details of how SEO works here – we’ve already covered this in our “SEO for beginners” overview.
There’s a saying that “If you can’t explain it to a child, you don’t understand it yourself.”
If the ideas behind SEO really are something anyone can learn, it must be possible to break it down that far, right? Let’s try.
What is Search Engine Optimization?
What is a “Search Engine?” How do they work?
When you want to find something online, but you don’t know where it is, you can use a tool called a “search engine” to help you.
A search engine looks very simple! When you use a search engine, you use words to describe whatever you are looking for.
Almost immediately, the search engine shows you all the websites that might have what you are looking for. A good search engine will show you pictures and videos and all kinds of websites. It’s like magic!
But how does a search engine know where to find what you are looking for?
Spiders – The Lego Blocks of Search Engines
Search engines use teams of robots to learn everything they can about everything that is online.
These robots are sometimes called spiders or crawlers because they go from one website to another like a spider crawling a web.
But instead of crawling on a web, these robots crawl on the connections between websites. These connections are called “links,” and there are more links online than stars in the sky or grains of sand on every beach around the world!
There are hundreds of billions of websites, and the links they have between them change all the time, so the robots are always hard at work.
They are always looking for new websites they haven’t been to before, and for anything that has changed since the last time they looked at it.
On every page a robot crawls, it takes notes about what it finds.
The robot makes a lot of notes! Notes about words, pictures, videos, even special computer language that humans can’t read. When it has learned all it can, the robot gives those notes to the search engine.
Building a Map (Search Index)
Search engines use those notes to build a map of the internet, called an “index.” In fact, this process of learning about everything on the internet and building a map is called indexing.
Just like a map tells you where cities and rivers and mountains are, this index tells the search engine where things are online.
When you ask a search engine to help you find something, it checks its index to see if it has learned about any website that might have what you are looking for.
Because computers are very fast at looking things up, and because the teams of robot web crawlers never stop working to index websites, a search engine will give an answer almost before you finish asking a question!
So that’s what a Search Engine is: a tool that has a map of everything online, built by teams of robots crawling links between websites.
And that’s how a Search Engine works: when you tell it what you are looking for, it checks its index to see if it has learned anything about any website that might be the right answer.
What is Optimization? How does it connect to Search Engines?
What is Optimization? Optimization is a fancy word that means “making something the very best that it can be.”
Remember that web crawlers look at every website to understand what is on it?
Those web crawlers are very good at finding websites to look at, but not very good at understanding what is on them.
Web crawlers can only tell their search engine what they understand about a website.
And when a website isn’t in the search engines’ index, it won’t recommend it at all!
That means that search engines sometimes don’t recommend a website, even if it has good information that could help someone.
People want search engines and their web crawlers to understand their website, so they do whatever they can to help them. They optimize it.
Making your website the very best website
Search Engine Optimization is for websites. SEO makes a website the very best that it can be for Search Engines.
There are a lot of ways to do this!
One way to optimize a website is to make special parts of the website easy for web crawlers to understand.
That way, when a web crawler visits a website it gets the right information. And because of the information in the search engine’s index, the search engines know to recommend the website it came from.
Another way to optimize a website is to include words and phrases used by people who might want to find your website.
If you use the exact words and phrases that people are searching for on your website, then search engines have an easy time finding you in their index when they look for answers.
A third way is to get other websites to include links to the website you are optimizing.
Because web crawlers move from link to link across websites, they think websites that have a lot of other links pointing to them are probably more important than websites that have just a few.
SEO is about making sure the robots that look at your website really understand what is on your website, using the same keywords and phrases as people who are searching for you. If you do these things, search engines will recommend you.
That seems pretty straightforward – what’s the catch?
The complicated bits are what you actually DO to optimize your website for SEO. What specific language and files do you need to have so web crawlers know what is on your page? What keywords should you be including in your content creation to rank higher on SERPs (Search Engine Result Pages)? How do you build valid backlinks that increase your domain authority?
We are helping startups and small businesses take control of their SEO, enabling them to rank on Google for critical search terms higher, faster, and gain the benefits of front page rankings to their business."

138,https://www.sageseo.ai/the-promise-and-perils-of-ai-in-seo-keyword-research/,"I’m frustrated.
The reason I’m frustrated is because of the exponentially increasing number of articles on the internet talking about using AI to do keyword research but not understanding how keyword research actually works.
Any good keyword strategy starts with researching your customer. Recently, the buzz is all about ChatGPT as an ai writer and how it solves all of your SEO challenges.
The problem is that ChatGPT isn’t good at keyword research. It’s good at coming up with something called semantic keywords. But that’s just a college-essay way of saying “similar topics or ideas”. It doesn’t mean they are easier to rank for ,or when put together into a blog post, that they will generate a front-page ranked article.
Today, I want to dive into this topic in more detail.
Before we get started
…a bit of background.
Prior to November of 2022 (ChatGPT’s launch), there were any number of articles about the best SEO tools or keyword research tools all over the internet. The reviews would cover topics like keyword ranking and keyword analysis, they’d dive into the keyword difficulty of a search term. There were many free keyword research tools like Google Ads keyword planner or keywords everywhere.
Paid tools are also in abundance; tools like Ahrefs.com and SEMRush.com are the gold standard when it comes to keyword research. But they are also built primarily for marketing professionals.
The result of this is that the average small business owner or early-stage startup typically might turn to paid ads instead of SEO because they didn’t have time to learn how to use the tools.
Enter ChatGPT (and my frustration). Look at all the things it ChatGPT can do in mere seconds!!
- You can brainstorm content ideas quickly
- You can write content within minutes instead of hours
- You can research keywords within seconds
Unfortunately, that’s not accurate. And here is why…
AI Tools don’t know how to do keyword research
This isn’t to say AI is bad at components of keyword research. But AI SEO by itself is much less effective than even basic human common sense.
This is why AI SEO tools by themselves will always fail to deliver good results.
Here is a quick example of how plausibly good ChatGPT is at coming up with keywords for a new article on dating apps for black professional women. I gave it the prompt give me a list of 10 keywords on the topic of dating apps for black professional women in 2023.
This is a great list. It gives you some good ideas of topics and keywords to write about. But it has little influence on how rankable the article you write will be. Will these keywords get you started writing? Absolutely!
Will you be ranked on the front page of Google by using keyword research from ChatGPT?
Not a chance.
Here’s why.
If I tweak my prompt just a bit and add the phrase easier to rank for to it, let’s see what it spits out.
Only one of the keywords is even in the database and has almost no search volume monthly. ChatGPT and other AI tools like it have no access to search analytics data. They can’t recognize search intent, and therefore, they have no idea about keyword optimization. What they are good at is finding those semantic keywords we mentioned above.
But semantic keywords have nothing to do with keyword research. It has to do with human language and how we associate different words. The AI isn’t doing keyword research to find those words. It’s using predictive analytics to find patterns in human language. It’s a meaningful component of keyword research and aligns well with Google’s north star of search intent.
Unfortunately, what it doesn’t do is help you at all with the core goal of SEO: ranking on the front page of Google search results.
One more example to illustrate the problem
Let’s say we decide to have ChatGPT generate a list of keywords that are a bit broader and are searched more often in Google.
These are much shorter keywords, but the problem remains. Of the 30 keywords it “suggested,” only 14 were searched enough on Google to warrant an entry in the Ahrefs database:
And of the 14 that were, only three of them (best dating apps for black women, black women dating, and black woman dating site) had any notable search volume.
The problem remains that AI without keyword data is relatively useless when it comes to doing keyword research.
ChatGPT can solve all my SEO problems
Since its launch, the world has exploded with new articles talking about the power of OpenAI’s software to automate really complex parts of SEO. The first problem many of them tackled…naturally one of the hardest parts of good SEO, is keyword research.
Many marketing professionals, including more SEO professionals than I can count, think it can solve the keyword research problem alone, or with a bit of human help. But keyword research is not a problem of language. It’s a problem of data.
We’ll talk more about that in a future article.
However, some of the great things it can help with for your SEO workflows are:
- Writing a content brief for a new article you want to write about, including potential sources of research
- Creating outlines for long-form content
- Mitigating the problem of staring at a blank screen
- Writing a blog post introduction to get you started
- Putting together a bulleted or numbered list for a particularly complex procedure you want to include in your article
What SEO problems can ChatGPT help with?
Writing content briefs for an article
ChatGPT is astoundingly good at generating what content marketers call content briefs. Given the right prompt data, it can generate content briefs like this for an article one of our customers is writing.
You can see it shows both a target audience as well as target keywords and dives into details for the article content. It even cited some sources that were from January of 2023. Looks like it’s getting more and more current.
Creating outlines for long-form content
If I were to ask it to create an outline for a blog post on the challenges of doing SEO keyword research, ChatGPT is more than capable:
You can see the quality and depth of the outline is generic. But it gets you started and helps you ideate and expand on any of those topics.
Enumerating mundane procedures with bulleted and numbered lists
This is one of my favorite use cases for ChatGPT. Oftentimes in the SEO world, we have to do a bunch of mundane things like updating DNS records or finding reports in Google Analytics. ChatGPT is amazing at helping us create documentation to teach our customers the right procedures.
Summary
In this article, I delved into the limitations of AI in keyword research and its use in SEO workflows. We talked through the nunaces of how AI tools, including ChatGPT, can generate semantic keywords like an SEO pro, but when it comes to actual keyword research, they fall short.
You see, keyword research requires more than just language skills, it requires access to search analytics data and an understanding of search intent – things AI can’t seem to grasp (yet). But, on the bright side, ChatGPT can help with other SEO tasks like writing content briefs, creating outlines, and even enumerating procedures.
While AI may not be the silver bullet for all your SEO problems, it can still be a helpful sidekick. And, let’s face it, SEO is already confusing enough; no need to make it any more complicated!"
139,https://www.sageseo.ai/the-virtuous-content-marketing-flywheel/,"Content marketing is a powerful vehicle to generate highly-targeted inbound visitors to your website. The benefit of finding your target audience and getting them to your front page is that they convert at a much higher rate than any other audience.
How much higher?
Organic traffic converts an average of 70-300% higher than paid traffic, according to recent Hubspot data.
Your next question is likely going to be something along the lines of “how do I get more organic traffic to my website?”
Our answer is to take advantage of what we like to call the Virtuous Content Marketing Flywheel.
The true power of content marketing is when you can measure how it’s working and then use that data to inform the next round of your content production efforts. But first, you need to understand the flywheel and then we can describe how to use it and reduce the length of time from start to finish. The faster your flywheel, the faster your results, and the more organic traffic and conversions you get from your data.
How do we do this? Let’s examine each step of the flywheel quickly.
- Plan Content – This is the tried and true “what are we going to write about” starting point. Without any good data, you’re going to take your best bet based on who your target audience is and what you sell. We all have to start somewhere and a solid understanding of your customers should allow you to generate 3-5 good article topics to begin your content marketing efforts.
- Research High Performing Keywords– Once you have your article topics, the next step is making sure you’re targeting keywords that are both relevant to your business products or services as well as rankable based on your domain authority and website reputation with Google. If you’ve been around a long time with a good content track record, you can likely rank for more difficult keywords. If not, it’s imperative to identify keywords that are easier to rank for so you can establish a track record of expertise, authority, and trust with Google (EAT).
- Create & Publish Content – Once you have your keywords, it’s time to create your content, edit it, and most importantly, get it on your website. Having a Google Doc sitting in your drive folder with the most amazing article just isn’t going to show any value at all. It needs to be online and indexed by Google. Which brings us to…
- Validate Google is Indexing Content – So many businesses create content, write blog posts, upload a brand new “amazing landing page”, only to never receive any traffic from it. That’s because Google either hasn’t discovered the content, they’ve crawled it and decided it isn’t worthy to add to their search index, or you potentially have some sort of technical SEO error. You need to fix those but you also need to know you have a problem. Use the Google URL Inspection tool to verify a URL is Indexed properly and showing up in search results. If it isn’t, fix the problem.
- Measure Website Visitor Behavior – Now that you have your content written, optimized for keywords, and showing up in Google’s search index, it’s time to take a step back and let it ride for 1-2 months. After that, you’ll start getting important critical data from Google Search Console (GSC) to understand how it’s performing and what keywords it is now appearing for.
- Optimize for Conversion – In marketing industry parlance, this is often called Conversion Rate Optimization or CRO. This next and final step of the flywheel is to take the data from GSC and use this information to inform and inspire your next set of article topics. If you’re a Sage SEO customer, you can watch our video to understand more about this data and how we help you optimize your next round of content.

140,https://www.sageseo.ai/what-is-a-sitemap-and-how-does-it-improve-my-seo/,"If you’re embarking on a digital marketing strategy that includes content marketing and a blog to attract website visitors, you’ll need to take a few critical steps to ensure your website is crawlable by all the major search engines (Google, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo!, Bing, etc.)
Sitemaps are one of the first and most important steps you should take.
What exactly is a Sitemap?
Sitemaps are advanced SEO tools that allow Google to view information about your site like the videos, pages, and files, as well as how those pieces of information are connected to each other. Google can then use this information to crawl your site much more efficiently so that they can give better recommendations.
Your sitemap.xml file tells search engines about the pages you think are important, and provides additional information so that you can optimize how you are recommended online by search engines.
Some of the most common sitemap entries include news, video, and files. Put into one sentence, sitemaps are critical for SEO because Google ranks pages, not just websites, so making sure Google can find each page is critical to a comprehensive SEO strategy.
Why would I need a sitemap?
If your website is properly linked, Google can usually do all of the legwork required to access all the pages. What’s linking? If every page that you think is important can be accessed somehow, that’s linking, but if you have a very large site, a complex site, or just don’t want to leave it up to Google, you can use a sitemap to make certain that you’re good! For those of you wondering why sitemaps are important, in a nutshell it lets Google see and recommend every page on your whole website.
Other reasons to use a sitemap can include if your page is new, if you have a lot of news or video/image content, or if you aren’t sure your site is properly linked. If your website is simple, or properly linked, however, a sitemap might not be needed, like if you want to sitemap one page website.
How do I create a sitemap?
While Google supports XML, RSS, mRSS, Atom 1.0, and Text sitemaps, this guide will only cover XML. XML is a style of code that is frequently used in development, with common features like XML comment, and XML viewer to facilitate ease of use. Furthermore, the ability to use a javascript xml search engine makes it a lot easier to use.
Does my website have a sitemap?
Many website builder apps like Wix, Squarespace, and Yoast etc. can generate sitemaps automatically, and you can check out your respective website’s pages for information on auto-generating a sitemap. In these cases your website probably already has a sitemap ready and waiting. For those who want to make a Google Sites sitemap, however, this guide is for you!
How do I find examples of sitemaps?
Some common sitemap examples can be found by simply searching for websites, like “match site map” or the like. These can be a useful graphical example.
What are the parts of a sitemap?
Basic Anatomy:
KEY NOTE: All URLs in a sitemap MUST be from a single host.
XML Tags:
XML Sitemap Example:
Note how the site map example shows the clear structure of each part of a sitemap.
Key Values:
XML sitemaps only ever use ASCII characters or control codes and special characters that XML supports. Replace every instance of these following characters with the code below:
- Replace & with &
- Replace ‘ with '
- Replace “ with ""
- Replace > with >
- Replace < with <
My sitemap is done. How do I submit it to Google?
To submit a sitemap, use the Sitemaps Report page in Google Search Console: https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451001
A common occurrence users run into is the error “Your sitemap appears to be an html page. Please use a supported sitemap format instead.” In this case, the code is not registering as XML and changes may be necessary to convert your sitemap to XML or any other accepted sitemap. If you’re wondering about how to find sitemap information, your Google account will be able to access that data. Just log into your Google website and go to the Sitemap page linked above!
Just A Few Last Words
Sitemaps are a great way to give your article a bit more spotlight. They can never hurt your SEO performance and can really give your website the boost it needs to start raking in traffic. We hope that this guide has been helpful and as always don’t hesitate to ask questions on Sage!"
141,https://www.sageseo.ai/what-is-an-seo-keyword-2022/,"What are SEO Keywords?
SEO Keywords are specifically-structured phrases that help search engines decide which pages to recommend first when a user searches for a particular item. If you’ve ever wondered “ how does google know what i want to search ” this is the reason. In essence, it helps Google decide the likelihood that your page is going to solve the question the searcher wants answered. Based on an algorithm that looks through these keywords, the web browser will then decide where on the results page your page will reside. When beginning to research a given topic it’s important to make sure that your SEO keywords are effective!
How do I find Keywords?
In short, LOTS of research. There are many sites that can give you search engine results, and by repeatedly combing through the results for a topic you want to target, you will build up a list of these words. The most critical part of this is to keep updating your keyword list – just like the internet, the best keywords are always changing. Old keywords need to be replaced with new, higher-performing keywords, and a diversity of keywords will make sure that you appear for many searches, not just for one or two specific ones.
How many keywords for SEO?
Think about SEO as if you are casting a net. When beginning to research a given topic, it’s important to make sure you’re casting a good net. The more keywords you implement, the finer the net is, and thus you will catch more fish. Without a lot of keywords, your net will have large holes that let many potential fish go. If you don’t update your keywords, it will be like fishing in an area where all the fish have already been caught – there won’t be many left gor you!
If you have a lot of keywords, but they aren’t diverse and merely laser-focus on one area, it will be like fishing with a very narrow net – you will catch everything in a very short area, but you are limited by the area you can fish. Instead, when asking how many keywords to use for SEO, the best strategy involves using many current and diverse keywords to catch a wide, fine net that will bring you the biggest catch of clicks and views!
What types of Keywords are there?
There are 8 main types of SEO Keywords: Short-Tail, Long-Tail, Product-Centric, Customer-Centric, Geo-Centric, Short-Term, Long-Term, and Intent Targeting.
Short-Tail Keywords (Head Keywords):
Short Tail Keywords are typically 3 words or less, and used by customers when they are at the initial stage of research. These keyword sentence look-alikes are typically higher-volume, but convey less search intent. This is because there can be many reasons for a short phrase. Most keyword research services focus on this type of keyword.
For example, if a user searched the term “why chocolate white” they could be referring to an old piece of chocolate with that weird white powder on it, or they might be looking into the benefits of using white chocolate over dark chocolate for a mousse. The point is that many short-tail keywords reflect multiple intents, but this doesn’t mean they can’t be helpful. Because of the simplicity of these keywords, they will often be very helpful because they have high volume, even if a targeted positive keyword list is more efficient.
Long-Tail Keywords:
What is considered a long tail keyword? Long-Tail Keywords are longer terms that convey much more intent than short-tail keywords. These longer phrases will often have lower volume, but also much lower competition, making it easier to capitalise on their searchers. This is because when you understand how to find long tail keyword phrases, you find users searching for a very specific item.
For example, if a user searched the term “is chocolate with white dust edible,” the intent becomes much easier to discern. Use these keywords to directly target specific searches that you know you can capitalise on. If you’re wondering how to look for long tail keyword matches, look for long keywords with high intent and lower volume. Both long tail and short tail keyword strategies are effective, so use both to catapult your viewership!
Product-Centric Keywords:
Focusing on targeted keyword lists for YOUR website, the Product-Centric Keyword is used to direct consumers with a need towards your product or website. These keywords are used by searchers in the early stages of buying a product or finding a solution, and are often traits of a product that they need to find. These words often have high search intent and conversion, and can be competitive should the product be generic enough (like water, or toothpaste).
For example, someone searching for a new computer may search “work laptop thin” or “powerful workstation laptop” which clearly shows their intent. When capitalising on these keywords, make sure to find the defining features of your product and emphasise those words over and over again.
Customer-Centric Keywords:
These are keywords that target who your market is. Is it older or younger? Male or female? Is there a specific occupation you are targeting, like marketers or doctors? These keywords are used to cast a net towards your specific market. Make sure that it is clear in your keywords who you are targeting to draw those demographics in.
A great example of this is high-end watercolour brushes. Say your website sells expensive, professional grade brushes. The customer-centric keywords you would use have to be directly targeted at this demographic. A strong example of using keywords would be words like professional, artist-grade, and sable hair, because these words will draw in the target demographic.
Geo-Centric Keywords:
Geo-Centric keywords are used when location is of specific importance to the business. These keywords are often uncompetitive due to the specificity of location, and can be very effective in directing eyes to your pages. For local businesses and niche products, location-based niche words research can be very powerful.
For example, if you are the only supplier of washing machines in the entire city, it is of great importance to emphasise where you are located. Saying “Burlington, Vermont washing machine repair” will draw many eyes from the region, whereas simply “washing machine repair” will attempt to compete with every washing machine repair shop on the internet.
Short-Term Keywords:
These are SEO keywords that capitalise on trends and fads that drive a sharp spike in demand before fading into obscurity. These are time-sensitive, and depending on the scale of the trend it may be quite competitive, but it can be a massive driver of growth as well. These SEO keywords often have very high intent and conversion because of their trendy nature.
For example, using keywords related to the NFL playoff game between the Bills and the Patriots will not only date this article, but also drive very high interest for a few days before, during, and after the game, but will be almost irrelevant a few weeks from now when there are newer games.
Long-Term Keywords:
As logic would follow, these are SEO words whose search volume increases and decreases slightly, but remains mostly constant over an extended period of time. These keywords are normally quite competitive, but can sustain extended traffic over long periods of time due to their perpetual relevancy.
For example, an SEO keyword like “how to make taco seasoning” will continue to be just as relevant in 5 years as it is today, and so it will see roughly the same volume in that period.
Intent Targeted Keywords:
Whenever a searcher conducts a search, it falls into 3 keyword match types: informational, commercial, and transactional. Informational searches are things the user wants to know more about, and aim to educate the reader. These searches often have very high intent, and can be great to target for blogs and other informational sites. Commercial searches are the first steps of purchasing a product. These searches are conducted to find information on a product and make a purchase decision. These keywords are very important for sales, as they direct customer focus towards their product instead of others. Lastly, transactional keywords are directly used in the purchase. These SEO keywords are used to compare products and find the best value, making them very important in competing with other businesses across the web.
For example, the keyword “what is difference between park and downhill ski” is an informational keyword – the buyer wants to know which type of ski to buy. Then, this may be followed by “best beginner downhill ski,” which is an example of a commercial search. This search will lead them to, for example, a pair of Rossignol SMASH 7 skis, at which point the prospective buyer may search “Rossignol smash 7 for sale” which would be the transactional keyword that leads to a purchase following a price comparison on multiple sites.
FAQ:
What is a positive keyword?
A positive keyword is a term that is flagged by Google to be prioritised by the algorithm. In much the same way Adsense places importance on keywords an advertiser bids on, positive keywords are used to determine which websites are displayed on the search results page. All SEO keywords are positive keywords from the point of view of the writer.
What is negative keywords in SEO?
While Adwords has negative keyword match types, SEO does not account for negative keywords. They play no part in SEO strategy for a webpage, although the feature is helpful in Adwords.
Which keyword is of the phrase match type?
Google Adsense uses an SEO-like algorithm to pair ads with viewers. A phrase match means that only when the exact phrase you specify is searched does your ad appear. When asked which of the following represents a phrase match keyword, a phrase match example could be “ski mask black,” where only when the user enters a search containing the exact phrase “ski mask black” is your ad shown."

143,https://www.sageseo.ai/zapier-beginners-guide-automate-your-online-workflows/,"Introduction:
Workflows and organizations will only getting larger and harder to manage as a business grows. Fortunately, you don’t have to be the one to deal with this problem! With our Zapier beginner’s guide, you can automate your organization and efficiently move information between webapps instantly, so you can focus on what you value most!
Today, we’re gonna take you through a Zapier beginner’s guide so you can hit the ground running and simplify your work. We’ll go over what automations are and what they can do, how to create an automation, and pricing plans so you know what to look for when scaling to meet your needs.
What is automation?
Automation just means that things happen automatically. You can do one thing, and have that automatically transfer into other actions without the need to do it yourself. It’s like a personal assistant – but faster!
Automation can be split into two different phases: When, and Then. Two variables you get to determine.
- When this happens.
- Then do this.
For example, when I send an email on Outlook to my team, then add a reminder to follow up in 1 day.
What is Zapier?
So how does Zapier come into this? Zapier lets you skip the coding involved with automation, and just get to the automation itself. Zapier sorts out the code, so you just need to tell it what to do and it will carry it out.
What can I use Zapier for?
- Frequent Tasks: Sending a weekly reminder to fill out an employee feedback form.
- Moving Data from One App to Another: Adding tasks on a project management app to your personal calendar.
- Tasks That Don’t Need Much Thinking: Copying a list of emails to a spreadsheet.
These tasks don’t need human comprehension to do, and that’s exactly what Zapier is for. Anything that can be done without much thought, but which takes time can be automated, and thus, can be solved with Zapier.
How do I automate with Zapier?
Our Zapier beginner’s guide will show you step by step! Zapier has a unique system for automation, called a Zap. Each Zap has a When, and one or more Then that dictates what happens. The trigger will tell Zapier what the conditions are to trigger the Zap, and the action is what is performed afterwards. Zapier integrations makes sure that you can use it with thousands of apps.
Creating Your First Zap:
Start by figuring out what you want your Zap to do. What applications do I want to use Zapier with? What do I want to trigger the Zap? What will my Zap do after being triggered? What do I want my Zap to interact with?
For this example, we’ll say that you want to move information from a Google Forms feedback questionnaire to Microsoft Excel. Zapier integration means that this example can apply to almost any app you want to use with Zapier! When there’s a new submission to the questionnaire, you want Zap to add the form information into an existing workbook in Excel.
Before you start:
Enter a sample submission into your questionnaire. This way, you know what the information will look like when setting up. Use an obviously false name in the form, so you can check to make sure the Zap works without risking the answers are confused to be legitimate. Create your workbook, and make sure to name the columns. Zap needs named columns to work.
Set up a trigger:
Use the Zap Editor to create new Zaps and edit ones already created. Select the app you want your trigger to be tied to. In this case, we will choose Google Forms.
Then, choose a trigger event. Once you’ve synced Zapier to the trigger app, you can select the specific form we want to be the trigger.
Test to see if the trigger works by inputting that example response from earlier, and clicking “Test Trigger”.
Set up an action:
Just like before, select your action app. This time, we will choose Excel.
Then, choose your action event. Select your spreadsheet, then choose the event that will create a new row. This means that the information submitted will be inputted into a new row for your review.
When you’re done, click “Continue”. You’ve be prompted to login, and after things are synced you’re ready for the next step.
Customizing the action:
This part is critical. Your Zap can now read information, but still doesn’t know where to put it. Zapier separates the data that is found into its various fields automatically, but still needs to be taught where to put that information. This is called “mapping”.
Zapier will see the different labeled columns in the Excel you’ve prepared before. Then, you need to match the inputs from your form to the columns. Once this is done, the Zap is ready to go!
Testing your Zap:
Enter the example input and make sure everything looks right. Once you’re done, you can hit “Turn on Zap” to turn it on!
