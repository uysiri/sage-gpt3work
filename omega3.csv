When you think of omega-3 fatty acids, think of them as the CEO of brain-supporting nutrients. It's so versatile in terms of its functionality for the brain; and unfortunately, our bodies aren’t able to produce omega-3 fatty acids, so we need to get them from our food, daily.

What is self-care?
Over the years, we have heard the importance of prioritizing mental and emotional health. A way to do that is to implement self-care habits into your routine. But, what does that look like? What is self-care? The National Institute of Mental Health defines self-care as “taking the time to do things that help you live well and improve both your physical health and mental health.” There is no one set definition of what self-care is. It is up to you to determine what that looks like for you. Essentially, self-care is how you show up for yourself. There is no right or wrong way to care for yourself.
It is important to make caring for yourself a habit. In order to show up your best in other areas of your life, you must show up for yourself first. Everyone always talks about the benefits of taking care of yourself and doing self-care, but where do you begin? It may feel like a daunting task at first, but it is possible to make a routine and stick to it. Here are 10 self-care tips on how to start and maintain a routine suitable for you.
1. Find breaks in your day
The biggest challenge is finding time to implement these practices into your daily schedule. It can be hard to balance work, school, and life priorities. Start small! 5 minutes in the morning, on your lunch break, or before bed is a great start to building the habit of making time for yourself.
Writing out your schedule on a calendar helps you to visualize your day and see just how many breaks you do have to do something for yourself. Visual scheduling is a way to plan breaks to prioritize your mental wellbeing and build a healthy habit of incorporating self-care.
2. Implement at least 1 self-care activity and slowly increase
When beginning to start a self-care routine, it is important to choose a task that is feasible. Starting with one self-care activity per week is a great way to start including wellness activities and also not overwhelm your normal schedule. As you adjust, you will find places to include more self-care time.
3. Find what makes you feel best
There is no one way to take care of yourself. Your self-care may look different from someone else’s. That's okay! Your self-care should be personalized for you. Do what makes you feel best and do not feel obligated to follow traditional self-care tips. A part of self-care is doing something that makes you feel good, that could be anything!
- Journaling
- Walking
- Meditation
- Drawing
- Bike riding
- Exercise
- Watch a comfort show
- Eat your favorite meal or snack
- Watching the sunset
- Listening to music
- Take a bath
- Read
- Clean
- Nap
4. Stay consistent
In order to see progress, it is important to stay consistent and prioritize your self-care activities. Mental health is just as important as physical health, take care of your mental wellbeing as you would your physical wellbeing.
5. Listen to your body
You have to recognize how your body communicates with you to give it what it needs. You may often feel tired and sluggish, have low energy, or feel burnt-out. These are all signs that you need a break. Self-care activities should be relaxing and serve as a way to give yourself a break. Make sure that you listen to what your body needs, so that you can pick the appropriate activity that helps combat what you may feel at the time. Some days you may need a more interactive activity like a puzzle to unwind, while other days you may need a nap to recharge.
6. Be gentle with yourself
Part of self-care is being gentle with yourself. Speak to yourself positively. Do not be too hard on yourself. We may make mistakes as we go along, but try not to let that hinder your progress. Practice affirmations as a form of self-care and be gentle with yourself.
7. Set goals for how to incorporate these self-care tasks daily
In the beginning of the week write down one thing you will do for yourself by the end of the week. This goal will help remind you to complete your activity. This also aids in making mental wellness a habit.
Today I am feeling ______, but I will ______ ,so that I feel ______
8. Adjust and change if needed
Your original self-care routine may not be the one that works for you long term. It is normal to change and your self-care will change for you. Communicate with yourself about what is working and what is not working.
9. Track your progress
Marking off days when you do an activity for yourself helps you see how much time you spend on self-care. Find a good balance of what works and what does not work for your self-care.
10. Find a healthy support system
Surrounding yourself with people who make self-care a habit motivates you to maintain your routine as a healthy habit. You will find that you may be able to complete some self-care days with someone else. It is good to talk about self-care to normalize it as a part of your lifestyle, but also to keep your practices sustainable.
Start your self-care journey with Omega 3
Starting a self-care routine does not have to be super extravagant. It should be suitable to your way of living and what makes you feel best. Your routine should be personalized to your lifestyle and needs.

Caring for your brain health and mental health

5,https://eatomega3.com/blogs/news/6-ways-to-de-stress,"6 Ways to De-Stress for Better Brain Health
Everyone tells us not to stress, but no one actually tells you how to de-stress. Stress is inevitable. We all are familiar with that feeling of stress overload. Built up stress can make you angry, irritable, and anxious. It can have an impact on your physical health by making your blood pressure high. Here are some wellness tips to help you de-stress. Implementing these techniques will provide mental clarity and help you build healthy habits.
When you feel stressed and overwhelmed, try some of these techniques to help you decompress.
1. Do something creative/fun
One way to relieve yourself from stress is to find an activity to do that is immersive. Take your mind off of the stress and allow yourself to decompress by doing something that requires focus and concentration.
Activities to try:
- Baking
- Cooking
- Painting
- Puzzle
- Running
- Knitting
- Yoga
- Take a bath
Fun brain fact!: Doing puzzles is a great way to work your brain as well. Puzzles help to strengthen short term memory by forcing your brain to practice spatial reasoning and problem solving. Your brain cells are creating new connections and old ones are being strengthened. Puzzles activate your left and right side of the brain by using reasoning and logic while playing around with imagination and creativity.
2. The 5,4,3,2,1 technique
This is a calming technique to use at the height of stress. You are connecting with your senses and distracting yourself from the dominating feeling of stress. This helps provide yourself with mental clarity to be able to effectively make decisions on how to combat and resolve unwanted stress. This is a simple and healthy habit to build and is useful on the go or in situations where you need immediate release.
- Name 5 things you see
- Name 4 things you hear
- Touch 3 things
- Name 2 things you smell
- List one thing you taste
3. Exercise
Exercise is a great way to release and reduce stress. When you exercise, you stimulate production of endorphins that help your body relax. Exercise also helps regulate cortisol levels which is the stress hormone that we all have. It may help you release the stress that you hold within your body that you never release when you are not as active.
4. Call someone for support
Calling a friend, loved one, or trusted peer can help you de-stress. Venting and having a person willing to listen to you can go a long way. Make sure you communicate what you need whether it be help, a solution, or just a person to hear you. Having a person there can help you unwind and not feel as overwhelmed. This also helps strengthen bonds and build deeper trusting connections. Talking to someone can help lighten the mood, serve as a distraction, or even dissipate feelings of stress all together.
5. Meditate
Meditation helps foster a state of relaxation and mental clarity. For meditation, sit or lay in a relaxed position. Focus all of your attention on breathing, counting, a mantra, or a sound. Meditation triggers your body’s relaxation response and restores the calm state. This helps oppose the state that stress puts you in and allows it to not take a toll on your body. Start small with a 5 minute meditation until you build the stamina to go longer. This is a healthy habit to do before bed to help allow your body to be the most relaxed it can be.
There are different types of meditation. For example, there is guided and unguided meditation. Some people may enjoy having a video to follow along with while others prefer to guide themselves. Explore different types of meditation to help you decompress and find the best fit for you.
6. Make a plan of action
Lots of times we may feel overwhelmed from a packed to do list. Making a plan of action for how to tackle each task will help you visualize how much time you have and a method to approach them. Many times we can be overwhelmed by thinking that we have to complete things all at once. Planning how to approach the tasks helps you.
Pro tip: Try some of our downloadable to-do lists in order to try and make a plan of action!
Our mission
At Omega 3, our purpose is to give people an avenue by which they can take care of their brains proactively. De-stressing is just one way you can effectively take care of your brain beyond nutrition.
When stress strikes, there are things you can do so that you do not let it overcome you. Try some of these techniques when you feel stressed."
6,https://eatomega3.com/blogs/news/7-ways-you-can-improve-your-mood,"7 Ways You Can Improve Your Mood
We all have our bad days. How we overcome them is what matters most. You might be the type of person to let the storm pass, however, there are solutions to when you feel stuck in a rut. Here are 7 ways to improve your mood!
1. Exercise
Physical activity can help improve your mood. When you work out and your heart rate increases, this triggers the production of norepinephrine. Norepinephrine helps mental clarity and may help reduce stress. Aerobic exercise increases the production of endorphins. Endorphins help reduce pain, stress, and help your overall well being. They are known as the “feel good” chemicals. Also, exercise increases blood flow to your brain, which helps concentration and memory. You can start small by implementing a 10 minute walk into your day or playing a sport weekly to ensure that you stay active.
2. Interact with people
Socializing can combat feelings of loneliness and give you a sense of belonging. Human interactions increase feelings of happiness and your overall sense of wellbeing. High levels of socialization have also been linked to lowering the risk of dementia. Also, human connections help lower anxiety and depressive symptoms, boost self-esteem, and increase empathy. You also build more trusting relationships.
3. Get involved
Try something new! Join a new club or try a new hobby that will stimulate your mind. Learning a new skill can boost your confidence and self-esteem. You will feel a sense of purpose and belonging. It could also provide you mental clarity and become a self-care activity.
New skills to try
- Knitting
- Painting
- Sewing
- Reading
- Gardening
- Event planning
- Learning a new language
- Camping
- Playing an instrument
- Running
- Scrapbooking
4. Communicate feelings
To understand your thoughts and feelings more clearly, it is important to communicate them. Finding a method of communication best for you will help you to get out of negative moods when you feel them. Communicating your feelings in a safe space without punishment or judgment can provide you mental clarity. Also, it may reduce feelings of anxiety, anger, stress, irritability, and sadness. Setting aside time to focus on your emotions helps you gain control over them and improve mental health. It is important to find a safe space where you feel most comfortable to acknowledge all of your feelings.
Some possible communication aids
- Talk to a therapist
- Try journaling
- Create a mood board
- Try meditation
- Talk to a trusted peer
- Film a video diary
5. Spend some time outside
When was the last time you went outside? Adults are also in need of time outside too, so go get a breath of fresh air. Oxygen is essential in maintaining a healthy brain and the brain uses 3 times more oxygen than muscles. Because your brain is sensitive to decreased levels of oxygen, taking a walk outside improves mental clarity and brain function. Also, being outside can improve concentration, increase vitamin D intake, and lower stress. Plan times in your day to be outside.
6. Get enough rest
It is important to get enough rest to ensure that your body can function properly. Inadequate sleep can cause stress and irritability and affect concentration and energy levels. Allot enough time in your schedule to make sure that you can get a full night of rest. The CDC recommends that teenagers (ages 13-18) get 8-10 hours of sleep per night. Also, it is recommended for adults (ages 18-65) to get 7-9 hours of sleep per night. College students, in particular, need 9-10 hours of sleep to support academic performance.
Pro tip:
Making a to-do list or schedule for the day can help you visualize all of your tasks. High priority tasks should be completed first in order of urgency. This will enhance time management. Usually, people who stick to a schedule are able to complete most of their daily duties. You will have time for meals, sleep, work, and breaks. Just because you make a schedule does not mean you have to stick to it exactly. It should only aid in helping you manage your time to make sure that you get the most of your day.
7. Eat a balanced meal
The foods you eat can have an impact on your mood. Make sure that you eat a balanced diet with all of the recommended nutrients and vitamins to keep your body at its best. One important nutrient that aids in improved mood is omega-3 fatty acids. They help to maintain a healthy body, and most importantly, a healthy brain. Omega-3 has been linked to improving cognitive function and mood and can lead to a decrease in depressive symptoms.
Omega 3 Bars are a great option for a snack that can help improve your mood. As it contains 1250 MG of omega-3s per bar, you’ll be sure to get the recommended amount of omega-3s in your diet. Throw them in a packed lunch or grab as a quick snack during the day.
When you're feeling down, there is always something you can do as a small pick me up. Try any of these tips to improve your mood anytime.

All About the IngredientsCranberries
Cranberries are high in vitamin C. In fact, 1 cup of raw cranberries contains 25% of your daily intake recommendation of vitamin C. Cranberries protect against liver disease and lower your blood pressure. They may also help improve eyesight and cardiovascular health. Cranberries are great for gut health and mouth health by helping to replace good bacteria to prevent issues caused by harmful acids in your body. Lastly, they help with urinary tract health.Peanuts
Peanuts are packed with fiber which aids in digestion and reduces inflammation. They are high in unsaturated fats or “good fats.” Good fat helps regulate cholesterol levels. Also, peanuts are a great source of protein. Furthermore, they can help your body stop small blood clots to lower your risk of heart attack or stroke.Dark Chocolate
Dark Chocolate contains anywhere between 50%- 90% cocoa. Cacao contains flavanols, a type of flavonoid, which are important for the production of nitric oxide in the body. Nitric oxide relaxes your blood vessels and allows for proper blood flow. Blood flow lowers risk of high blood pressure and improves cognition. Blood flow throughout the body and to the brain makes sure everything is functioning properly and to its best ability. Dark chocolate also has antioxidant properties that help fight cell damage and protect against sun damage. Lastly, dark chocolate contains many essential minerals. It contains phosphorus that helps with bone health, magnesium for sleep quality, and zinc for immune system support. Get the most benefits from your sweet craving by choosing a more concentrated cocoa content like dark chocolate over milk chocolate or white chocolate.Almonds
Almonds help lower the bad type of cholesterol and increase the good kind. They also have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that help fight heart disease. Almonds are also high in vitamins and minerals like phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, fiber, and vitamin E. They help lower blood sugar spikes and better gut health. Lastly, they provide your body with protein to help repair and make new cells.Omega 3 Bars
Omega 3 bars contain 1250 MG of omega-3 fatty acids. Omega 3 is very vital to your physical health and mental health too. Your body cannot produce omega-3 on its own, so it is important to make sure you incorporate it in your meals. Omega 3 helps with improving mood, memory, cognitive function, and overall brain health. It may also decrease risk of heart disease, cancer, inflammation and visible aging. Omega-3 fatty acids affect metabolism, function, and response to hormones. They are also energy sources for your cells and cell walls, the basic building block of our bodies. It is important to give your body what it needs to function to its best ability. Omega 3 bars ensure that you do just that!
There are delicious snacks that are also good for the brain. Mindful and brain healthy diets do not have to be hard. Check out our other recipes for more ideas on brain healthy snacks and food for brain healthy diets!

Not hungry? No time? Too tired? Sick of the same foods? All of these may be a reason you skipped breakfast this morning. Mom did not lie when she told you the most important meal of the day is breakfast. Skipping breakfast has an impact on not only your physical health, but psychological health as well. According to the American Heart Association, breakfast eaters tend to have lower rates of heart disease, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol (Fortune Journals, 2017). Beyond just accepting that breakfast is important, have you ever sat back and analyzed how that healthy meal actually stimulates us throughout the day? What does that healthy meal entail? How am I ensuring that I get all the proper nutrients from my foods? Do not worry! I have some answers and tips on foods that ensure you have enough energy throughout the day.
Why is nutrition important for brain health?
Beyond physically having enough energy for the day, the nutrients that we get support our brain function too. Omega-3s are an important nutrient that you get from food to develop your cell walls and maintain a healthy body. Bodies are not able to produce omega-3s on our own so it is imperative that we get these nutrients through the foods we eat. Omega-3 is linked to cognitive development and better learning and memory. Also, proper amounts of omega-3 help to support blood flow to the brain and that in turn increases brain function like memory and lowers risk of developing dementia (Pearson, 2017). Overall, brain cells with high levels of omega-3 are better at communicating with other cells, which is an important process for brain function.
Now that we understand how foods and brain health are linked, how do we implement this knowledge into our diet? There are many foods that offer omega-3.
7 Foods high in omega-3s
- Nuts
- Blueberries
- Sunflower Seeds
- Salmon
- Tuna
- Berries
- Omega 3 Bars
Omega 3 Bars
Omega 3 bars are a smart choice when choosing a snack that supports brain function and health. With a delicious blend of chia seeds, flax seeds and oats packed with 1250 MG of omega-3s per bar, you get all that you need in one. They are all natural, gluten-free, and dairy free. Omega 3 bars help with memory, mood, and focus. They are a great grab and go option to get proper nutrients to fuel your day!

12,https://eatomega3.com/blogs/news/how-to-set-a-new-years-resolution-and-stick-with-it,"How To Set a New Year's Resolution and Stick With It
The start of a new year is the indicator of a clean slate and encourages people to make changes. This is commonly done through setting a New Year's resolution. A New Year’s resolution is a promise that you make to yourself to start breaking bad habits and building new healthy habits.Some common resolutions include:
- Losing weight
- Sticking to a healthy diet
- Spending more time with friends and family
- Creating better budgeting habits
- Exercising more regularly
- Trying therapy
- Stop smoking or drinking
- Quit biting nails
It is about that time of the year to start thinking about your New Year's resolutions. Here are some tips to help you not only set a proper resolution, but make sure that you reach it!
Be Realistic
Before setting your resolution, it is important to ask yourself some important questions. In order to be successful, you have to set a feasible resolution/goal.
For example, if your goal is weight loss, it is not realistic to set your resolution as “I will lose 20 pounds in 1 week.” This is not realistic and not healthy. You want to be as specific as possible beyond saying “I will lose weight,” but you also want to be realistic. Instead, make sure that you are giving yourself the proper amount of time to complete your goals around your everyday life and schedule. Being specific helps you keep track of your time and serves as a soft timeline to keep track of your goals. A better resolution might sound like “I will lose 20 pounds by summer.” Lastly, be careful with giving yourself super strict number cutoffs when setting resolutions. This will create fixations that can be unhealthy.Before setting your resolution, try asking yourself:
- Did you give yourself enough time to achieve the goal?
- Why am I working towards this goal?
- Will this work with my schedule?
- Is this something that makes sense for me financially?
- Is it something I can keep up with?
- Will I still want this for myself in a year’s time?
- Is this change healthy for me? Mentally? Physically? Emotionally? Spiritually?
- Who/What will help me achieve this goal?
- What things am I willing to let change?
- What things do I not want to change?
Find Resources
When getting started, gathering resources is a great way to help map out how you will reach your goal.
For example, if your New Year’s resolution is to create a budget, you will gather resources that help with that goal. You may look for books on how to budget better, join a group or club, or find templates for mapping out a budget. You may be interested in a financial advisor, a budget focused blog, or even videos on ways to save money. Before starting, gathering resources can help you feel more guided and prepared to make change.Potential resources:
- Books
- Youtube videos
- Blogs
- Clubs or social groups
- Social media
Have a Support System
Having a support system with people working towards the same goals or someone who knows you are working to change something can be beneficial. They can help motivate and support you. Connecting with someone who is working towards the same goals as you gives you an accountability partner. You can check in with each other to make sure that you both are on track and working towards your goal. You also can share tips and resources. This journey will not always be easy and you may reach points where you could use extra help or motivation. Having a support system makes sure that you are always on track and always have the tools you need to succeed.
Break Resolutions Into Smaller Goals
When you start working towards your goal, it can be overwhelming to think about where to start. Breaking your larger resolutions into smaller goals can help you devise a plan for where to begin and all the things you need to do to reach your end goal. Too much too fast can be unsustainable for your goal. Starting small is important for long term success.
For example, if your goal is to eat healthier, you do not want to jump straight into a new diet. Starting by replacing one item at a time is a great way to ease yourself into trying new foods.
Commit
In order to see the best results, it is important to commit to the process and give 100% effort.
- Write down your goal.
- Write 3 positive things that will happen upon reaching your goal.
- Why is this your resolution?
- Find images and quotes that relate to your resolution.
- Create a collage.
Hang this up somewhere where you will see it everyday as a reminder to yourself why you are working towards your goal. This will encourage you to stay committed.
Track Progress
Throughout the year, keep track of your progress towards your goals. This will be useful to you when you reach a point where you may feel like giving up or do not see how far you have actually come. Take note of your successes, struggles, why you are working towards this goal, and who is helping you reach this goal. Note positive and negative changes within yourself. All of this will help you self reflect and be a tracker for you during the year.
- Video diary
- Journaling
- Talking with a friend
Look at Past Failures
For the best chances at reaching your resolution, look at your past attempts at breaking your bad habits or trying to reach this new goal. What worked? What did not work? Ultimately, why did you not get to your goal? Looking at your past failures can help be a blueprint and advice to you to help you understand things that you do not want to do again. You may find that you need to alter your goal or that it was not reasonable. Past failures serve as corrections and motivation for you to reach your goal this time around.
Plan for Rewards/Celebrate Successes
Incentivize yourself and remember to celebrate your small successes along the way.
One way to remain motivated is to incentivize you to reach your goal. This will encourage you to stay on track. An incentive could be trying a new restaurant you have been wanting to try or buy a new book you have been wanting to read. Find something that you really want to celebrate your victories.

13,https://eatomega3.com/blogs/news/initiative-behind-omega-3,"What Omega-3 Can Do for You
Omega-3 fatty acids are a powerful nutrient that not only supports a healthy brain, but also a healthy body. We cannot naturally produce DHA (one of the fatty acids that make up omega-3) without the help of food, so consuming a diet rich in omega-3 is essential to supporting both your mental and physical health. Here are five ways that consuming omega-3 fatty acids can enrich your life:
- Decrease Risk of Heart Disease
By reducing triglycerides, blood pressure levels, and preventing the formation of harmful blood clots, omega-3 fatty acids have been proven to significantly improve heart health.
- Fight Inflammation
Inflammation is often caused by illness or infections. However, many people struggle with persistent or chronic inflammation, which can affect any part of the body. Omega-3 fatty acids work to reduce the molecules and substances within the body that cause inflammation.
- Help Prevent Certain Cancers
Studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids work to prevent the spread of certain cancers like breast and prostate. Oncologists often recommend diets high in omega-3 to patients undergoing cancer treatment.
- Improve Mental Health
Low levels of DHA are linked to depression, anxiety, memory loss, and many more psychiatric conditions.
- Help With Anti-Aging
DHA helps maintain youthful, supple skin by supporting cell-membrane health and hydrating your skin. Studies also suggest that diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids prevent memory loss and reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease."

15,https://eatomega3.com/blogs/news/positive-mental-health,"Omega 3 Founder, Bright Djampa, On His Secret to Brain-Health
Omega 3 founder, Bright Djampa, noticed that food was often left out of discussions surrounding mental health. He founded Omega 3 with the mission of promoting mental health awareness and empowering people to take charge of their mental health through nutrition.
Q: Why did you start Omega 3?
A: I always grew up with a very mental health-conscious family, and I’m very thankful for that. Being in that environment made me realize how privileged I was in that sense and how many people don’t have that. I wanted to provide an avenue for people to take care of themselves proactively. During my studies at the University of Maryland, I found a passion for omega-3 fatty acids and promoting mental health through nutrition.
Q: How did the idea for your business come about?
A: During my first nutritional food class at the University of Maryland, we talked about omega-3 fatty acids. I noticed that most of the discussion surrounding omega-3 was about fish oil. My professor jokingly told me that if I wanted to create something with plant-based omega-3s, I should. A granola bar just made sense—it’s affordable, accessible, and easy to consume daily.
Q: Why do you believe it is important for others to incorporate a more inclusive approach to brain health?
A: We are in a time where people are becoming very aware of our brain health, but it’s important to look at it from all angles and use a more proactive approach. Nutrition is just one of the tools in our toolbox to take care of our brain health.
Q: Why are omega-3 fatty acids important?
A: Omega-3 fatty acids help maintain DHA levels in the brain. Low levels of DHA can cause issues to your brain health and have been linked to depression, anxiety, memory loss, and a whole host of other mental health issues. Since our brains don’t naturally produce this hormone, we have to get it from food. When most people think of omega-3, they think of fish oil or eggs, but I really wanted to be more environmentally friendly and inclusive. That’s why I chose to use chia seed and flaxseed in our products.
Q: What are your favorite brain health self-care routine tips?
A: It’s very important to do a host of things—exercise, eating a nutritious diet, speaking with someone, and really just voicing how you feel. Processing your emotions will allow you to more comfortably deal with your mental health. Recently, meditation and journaling have been helping me a lot. It’s much easier to make sense of your thoughts when you write them down. They just become more coherent on paper."
16,https://eatomega3.com/blogs/news/what-are-omega-3-fatty-acids,"What Are Omega-3 Fatty Acids?
Here at Omega 3 Nutrition, our focus is encouraging people to include omega-3 fatty acids in their diet. But what is omega-3? Why is it important? Here is a simple explanation of what omega-3s are, how they work, and all the benefits surrounding them.
What are omega-3 fatty acids?
Omega-3s are fatty acids, the building blocks of fat stored in our bodies. They affect metabolism, function, and response to hormones. They are also energy sources for your cell walls that help keep your heart, lungs, blood vessels, and immune system healthy. While you digest, fats are broken down into fatty acids for the blood stream. They are the primary structural component for the brain, making up 8% of the brain.
There are 3 main omega-3 fatty acids: alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). While DHA and EPA are found primarily in seafood, ALA is mainly found in plant oils, nuts, and vegetables. Your body cannot produce omega-3s on its own, so it is important to get them from the foods you eat. EPA and DHA are important for brain protection and structure.
Benefits of omega-3 fatty acids
There are many benefits of omega-3s. Be sure to get the recommended amounts to reap its complete benefits! Low levels of DHA have been linked to depression, anxiety and memory issues. However, there are so many more benefits than just helping improve mental health.
Omega-3s may:
- Support blood flow to the brain
- Improve mood, memory, and concentration
- Help lower depression and anxiety symptoms
- Reduce inflammation

What’s the first thing you think about when you hear the word nutrition? Maybe you think about healthy foods and the way they affect your body. Maybe you associate nutrition with fitness and exercise. But what about your brain?
Historically, nutrition research has focused on physical health rather than mental health. However, studies continue to prove that our brains, like every other organ in our bodies, respond directly to what we consume. Although no single nutrient can cure mental illness, eating a nutritious diet rich in essential vitamins, proteins, and fatty acids is essential to keeping your brain healthy and stable.
A study in 2017 split 67 people suffering from clinical depression into two groups. One group met with a dietician and followed a balanced, nutritious diet, while the other group made no dietary changes. After 12 weeks, over a third of the group who met with the dietician were no longer classified as depressed, whereas there were no significant changes in the control group. This study is part of an emerging field of research known as nutritional psychiatry, which studies the relationship between food and mental health.
Omega-3s are one of many essential, brain-balancing nutrients. Over 60% of adults don’t consume enough omega-3s to meet basic nutritional needs. Deficiency in these crucial fatty acids is linked to depression and anxiety. Taking charge of your mental health can be daunting, but it doesn’t have to be. It can start with small changes such as introducing essential nutrients, like omega-3 fatty acids, into your daily diet. Next time you find yourself at the grocery store, we encourage you to try shopping with your brain health in mind."

33,https://eatomega3.com/pages/synopsis-of-the-scientific-research-on-omega-3-fatty-acid,"Rough 68% of Americans are deficient in omega-3 fatty acids, despite it having an enormous amount of benefits. [1] In order to do omega-3 fatty acids justice, we have dubbed it the CEO of brain-supporting nutrients. It has such versatility and functionality within the human brain. For starters, omega-3s are a primary structural component of the organ itself, representing 8% of its total weight, and the majority of the weight of substructures like neuronal plasma membranes. [2]Additionally, greater consumption of these acids has been found to correlate with higher gray matter volume in critical components of the brain - especially in its memory center, the hippocampus. [3] [4] The core diver of this correlation is omega-3’s apparent capacity to induce the creation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that supports new neuron formation
One of the most beneficial aspects of omega-3 fatty acids that have been realized through studies is their ability to counteract inflammation and free radicals that contribute to a whole host of maladies from brain fog to literal damage. The aspect of omega-3s that gives it the ability to do this is its signaling capabilities to the body to mass-produce the antioxidant protein Nrf2 and “mediator” molecules that prevent, halt, and resolve inflammation. [5] [6] [7] [8] The impact of these biological mechanisms has been shown to be substantial across structural and emotional cognitive outcomes. For instance, studies have found that consumers of omega-3s are less likely to be anxious or depressed. [9][10] Additionally, a 2007 study tracked over 8,000 healthy older adults and found that those who regularly ingested omega-3-rich oils were 60% less likely to develop dementia than others. [11]
Furthermore, the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids has a strong correlation with neuronal plasticity, memory retention, and capacity to learn. Studies that took a look at 4-10 year-olds, found that omega-3 intake was associated with improved reading ability, listening comprehension and vocabulary acquisition, and activation of the prefrontal cortex. [12] [13] [14] Moreover, Two 2012 studies found that the working memories of both younger (aged 18-25) and older (aged 51-72) adults improved when omega-3 pills were taken for extended periods of time. [5] [6] Lastly, across animal studies where brain injury occurred, omega-3’s corresponded with greater plasticity through reductions in oxidative damage, learning impairment, and cellular homeostasis disruptions. [15] [16] [17]
In essence, omega-3 fatty acids can do a good bit of everything."
