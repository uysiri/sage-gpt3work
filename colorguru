Kelly
(Flame is one of Kelly’s best colors!)
I received color consultation from Color Guru several years ago and am still applying the principles to my wardrobe today. It felt like an ancient secret had been shared with me! Not only do I look better, but my closet is much simpler. Can’t recommend enough!
Missy
(Crisp Cobalt is one of Missy’s best colors)
Following the Color Guru’s advice, I discovered that this blue was a great color for me, so I decided to give it a try. I had a crush on this color the very first time I saw it, but didn’t think I could actually wear it. Well, I have to say that I’m more than happy with the result!

Lunide
(Midnight Navy is one of Lunide’s best colors!)
Super thrilled about the color consultation. Color Guru did a phenomenal job — the colors are pretty accurate with my personality! Thank you again for the grand gesture.
Jenna
(Pansy is one of Jenna’s best colors!)
It was a bit scary to move away from the blacks and grays I’ve always been comfortable with, but for the first time I actually have a plan in place! Now I can invest in the colors that make me GLOW. My Color Guru analysis has completely changed the way I think about my clothes.
Annelise
(Lapis is one of Annelise’s best colors!)
I’ve always known I was a winter, but had no idea what type of winter (I fall into the rare Vivid Winter category).
If you’re curious for yourself or a gift for a loved one, do not hesitate! You will find a surplus of information and color cards to help you keep in mind what shades suit you best!
Rosemary
(Marigold is one of Rosemary’s best colors)
People say, “Everything you wear just looks so good on you!”
I gush about Color Guru to anyone who will listen, which includes random strangers at the store who compliment me. It was the best money I spent this year, hands-down.
Meera
(Papaya is one of Meera’s best colors!)
Working with Jeannie at Color Guru was so much fun! Now I know exactly what looks great on me! I now shop confidently and rock all of these new colors!
Abbie
(Lemon Drop is one of Abbie’s best colors)
“Life changing! I never knew that colors could make such a difference! More than make up or even a new hairdo. Thanks for the secret weapon! I wish I’d known this years ago.”

1,https://yourcolorguru.com/3-reasons-to-know-your-best-colors/,"Have you ever thought to ask “What are my colors?”
Likely, some of you have. But some of you are like me 20 years ago and when my aunt said to me “I think you’re picking ALL the wrong colors for yourself” I was like “Wait, there are RIGHT colors?” (I’m fully admitting that I was not born with superior color analysis abilities, they were indeed learned.)
Why plunk down the money for a color expert to do a personal color test on you so that you can find your color palette? Is it really worth investing in a virtual color analysis?
Now, you know I’m biased, but still 100% YES. And considering that the #1 feedback we get from our clients is “I wish I had done this YEARS ago” I think I’m not alone.
So here are 3 simple reasons why you should know your season colors.
1 – You’ll look your best in your colors
Have you ever wished someone would just tell you what looks best on you so you could just put it on and be done with it? I know you have because if you’re like most of the people I work with, you’re a busy person who doesn’t have all day to browse fashion magazines and Pinterest for outfit ideas. You have more important things in your life.
BUT…you still want to look great! You just want it to be easy. And knowing your colors does just that. Makes it easy to look great in everything you wear!
See, not everyone looks good in every color. The wrong colors can make you look older, tired, washed out, even ill. While the right colors make your skin and eyes look brighter, your teeth look whiter, and give you a GLOW. There are lots of those colors, so whey not wear JUST THOSE all the time?
2 – Shopping for Clothes Becomes Super Simple
Clothes shopping is a WHOLE thing. There was one time in my life I remember liking it, and that was when I was a teenager and my mom would drop me off at the mall for a few hours with my best friend Kat. We would browse, we would try things on, we would ooh and ahh over things we liked, and laughed at things we didn’t. It was a fun afternoon of leisure.
Now, at 46, I own a business, I have two kids who do activities, I’m active in my community, I do laundry, cook, clean, etc. An afternoon at the mall? Not gonna happen. So I online shop. Sometimes I grab a cute top while I’m picking up household stuff at Target.
And this is where having a color card really shines! If I’m at Target and a top comes in 10 colors, I know EXACTLY which one or two are best for me. It eliminates the choice, and it feels SO easy.
If I walk into a clothing store, I just SCAN the racks for my colors. Then, if I take 5 things into the dressing room, all I assess is whether I like the fit. I already know all the colors work beautifully on me.
If I’m online shopping, I just google search “teal top” (because teal is literally my fave color ever) and viola – 100 teal tops appear before me. Easy peasy. Shopping time is cut in half!
3 – You Automatically Create a Coordinated Wardrobe
Having a seasonal color analysis done by a color consultant provides so much more than just which colors look best on you. It creates a wardrobe where everything matches seamlessly. As I’m know for saying “It’s not just your prettiest colors – it’s a PLAN for your wardrobe.”
See, your color card is a FAMILY of colors that are designed to work together.
When you pull out a pair of pants, nearly every top will go with them. When you put a dress on, you automatically have shoes, jewelry, a jacket that goes with it. Your outerwear, your belts, your bags – everything matches!
Putting outfits together becomes simple and fun.
So, I highly recommend looking into getting a 12 season color analysis by a professional color analyst. It helps not only with every day dressing, but also in so many cases outside of daily dressing:
- best colors to wear for professional photos
- best colors to wear on camera
- best colors to wear for video interview
- best colors to wear for pictures outdoors
The list goes on! A seasonal color analysis test is an investment that will pay off for years to come.",colorguru
2,https://yourcolorguru.com/3-things-ive-learned-from-being-a-professional-color-consultant/,"Before I was offering online color consultation services, I was actually an in-person color consultant. Yep, Color Guru actually started with me holding color parties in people’s homes! People always say “Sort of like a Tupperware party?” Yep! Sort of like a Tupperware party! I would take my 200+ fabric swatches and drape people in front of their friends to show them what a difference the right shade could make, and making personal color recommendations as I went!
It was a lot of evenings and weekends, and I began to get overbooked, which was a problem because I had a baby and a toddler at the time. So, since then, I’ve become strictly and online color consultant.
However, what I’ve learned color parties as well as well as virtual consultations doesn’t change. Here are 3 of the things I’ve learned from being a seasonal color analysis expert.
Most people only know 2-4 of their best colors
People tend to thing they know their best colors, but generally, they only know a few. That’s great, but there are lots of colors they are completely ignoring that will look amazing on them. It’s funny because most people think – “If I get my colors done, I’ll feel limited to just those colors” but the exact opposite happens! When we hand them a color card with their best 35 shades, they actually feel liberated to try all these new, beautiful shades they’d never considered before! And try them with confidence, knowing that those shades will highlight their hair, skin, and eye color.
Colors can change with age, but only for a small percentage of people
The most common question I get asked as a color advisor is “What is my color palette?” Obviously…
However, it is usually followed up by the question “Will my colors change with age?” For the majority of people, the answer is no. When I’m looking for someone’s color palette for skin tones, I not only consider their skin, but their hair and eye color as well. Eye color doesn’t change much after the age of 7. The undertones in the skin also don’t change – even though the overt color may look lighter as we age. The hair, however, is changeable – whether through natural hair color changes or artificial ones. Sometimes when someone with cool skin and eyes had warm hair and then it turns cooler as they age, they can jump over to a cool color palette serving them better. The most common is that I see Autumns, Winters, and Springs sometimes turn into Summer types. Here is an example below with Laurie. With the deeper, warmer hair on the right, she looks best in Warm Autumn color palette shades, but once her hair has gone grey, the light, cool, muted Summer color palette suits her best. Her original skin color palette had to change because with light, cool hair framing her face, her ideal types of colors changed with it.
A color palette will completely transform the way you shop
For this one, just head over to our Google reviews! Almost everyone says their shopping has been transformed by shopping with their color card. Here’s one of over 100 Google reviews!
Shopping with a color card takes the “guess work” out of buying the best colors for you. Having your color style nailed down with professional color consulting services is an absolute game changer. I always tell people “You’ll never shop the same way again!”
So, those are my 3 things, but here’s a few more questions I get asked a lot.
What is a color analyst?
A color analyst is someone who analyzes your skin, hair, and eye color to match you with your ideal color palette for clothing.
Which season are you?
I’m a Calm Summer, and I’m a rare person who’s season DID recently change! I used to be a Calm Autumn, but much like Laurie, my hair has cooled off with age and I have muted, cool skin and eyes.
Do I need to look for a color consultant near me?
As a virtual expert, I can confidently say no! We’ve refined our virtual color consultation system for the last 10 years. We made mistakes in the beginning for sure! But now, we know the art and science of seasonal color analysis like the back of our hand. Our color consultants have determined season types for over 10,000 people in 25 countries (and counting!)

3,https://yourcolorguru.com/5-common-mistakes-when-choosing-your-own-colors-video/,"Choosing your own colors is difficult and requires a lot of effort. It takes time to find the right colors that compliment you. Whether you’re out shopping or picking from your wardrobe. Save yourself time and money with a professional color analysis.
There are several mistakes we make when we try to pick our own colors. Here are 5 common mistakes I see when giving a color analysis.
Wearing Too Much Black
One of the most prevalent mistakes revolves around black. Many people think they can wear black well. But not every season is fit to wear black. A winter wears black beautifully. But not so much the other seasons.
Charcoal Gray, for example, is a better option for a summer. Black is looked at as a great basic for everyone. For the springs and falls it can look too heavy and washed out. It can also drag down a summer a little bit.
Not Coordinating Your Makeup Colors
Save yourself time and money with a professional color pallet. Once you wear those colors and clothes consistently you’re going to look amazing. It completely transforms the way you wear clothes and shop for them.
When you’re not following your color pallet it’s difficult to have balance. The harder something is, the easier it is to make mistakes. You can use your color pallet to help choose your makeup too. Once you know what your color pallet is you can transfer it to anything and begin to transform yourself.
Wearing Colors Too Bright for You
There are two seasons for bright colors which is winter and spring. Summer and fall are not meant for bold colors. They’re complimented more by softer colors. These bold colors don’t compliment you or bring out your natural beauty.
It’s important to know the difference between a clear color and a muted color. Winter and springs look good in bright clear colors. Summer and fall look good in muted colors. Employ this and you’ll reduce your mistakes greatly!
Being Stuck in a Color Rut
People seem to think that they are limited to the colors they’ve found. They may have found a color that looks great on them. But when you’re limiting yourself to just these colors you don’t see your other options. There are several colors you’re ignoring that will compliment you.
You’ll begin to surprise yourself with the colors you didn’t know would compliment you. Have a professional color analysis to open your world of color. You can wear a particular shade of every single color, you just need to pick the right shade. There is a color out there for everybody.
Waiting Too Long for a Color Analysis
There is so much value in having a color analysis done. It’s something you can use for the rest of your life. Many women I’ve spoken to have wished they got their color pallet sooner. It makes it effortless to look good. Every color in your wardrobe will bring out your natural beauty.

60,https://yourcolorguru.com/about/,"In fact, I remember wondering – how could I have a closet packed with clothes and still feel like I had “nothing to wear?”
Looking washed out in my clothes
Feeling like I was guessing at what looked good on me while shopping, and
Having a cluttered closet full of pieces that didn’t go together
Turns out, not every color looks good on every person.
The wrong colors make you look washed out, overwhelmed, tired, and older. The right colors highlight your natural beauty and make you look radiant and glowing!
PLUS, when you shop what I call “Color First”, you simply scan the store for your best colors and ignore everything else! This rang my efficiency bells!!!
My theory was that if I always shopped “Color First”, I could look better, cut my shopping time in half, and create a coordinated wardrobe through color!
I did a test run for a few months. And DANGIT. It worked. Then, I became obsessed with helping others discover their best colors, and this new way of shopping for clothes.
But the problem was that the seasonal color analysis systems that were available at the time were outdated. Many of the colors they recommended for me I couldn’t even find in stores, so I decided I’d have to create my own color palettes, taking into consideration that the colors had to be:
This was the time in my life when I went into full-on “leave-me-alone-honey-just-order-a-pizza-for-the-kids” researcher mode.
I dove in and learned everything I could about hair, skin, and eye color, and how those features determined our ideal color palettes. And then I created my first set of color cards, which I then revised several times that year.

(Aquarius is one of Pamela’s best colors!)
As you know, I’m an actor, and I need to have audition outfits, for many different character types, ready to go in a snap. Knowing what colors flatter me has made a huge difference in my confidence walking into audition rooms (in addition to daily life!), and I often receive compliments from casting directors, as well as other actors in the waiting rooms, on the colors I wear. So, try this story on for size:
I was at a wardrobe fitting for an episode on a major network TV show. The costumers had a rack of possible outfits waiting for me. I pulled out my color card and at first, they weren’t sure that a mustard yellow blouse would look good on me, but I assured them it was worth trying on. (It has since become one of my go-to colors.) Guess what blouse, out of all of them on the rack, I ended up wearing? We all agreed it was very flattering and I felt fabulous in it!
So, thank you, again, for doing what you do! You are da colorful bomb!
Tyrone
(Raisin is one of Tyrone’s best colors)
I came across Color Guru while watching a video on YouTube and I’m so thankful that I did. I was in the process of putting together my self-tape studio at home, and as a darker-skinned Black actor I was curious which backdrop option would be ideal for me.
The Color Guru not only provided me with exceptional and thorough information about wardrobe color options that would work best for me, she also went a step further and gave me the self-tape backdrop options that would complement me best.
Casting directors started calling me in more frequently for television and film, and I’ve booked several network roles since using the service. I can’t recommend Color Guru highly enough.

My consultation with Color Guru has helped me see what colors work for me, which is invaluable. But now I also know what colors to avoid, which is saving me time and money on wardrobe choices!

Jasmine
(Peach Blush is one of Jasmine’s best colors!)
I love Color Guru! I didn’t realize the colors I was choosing for for headshot sessions didn’t bring out the sparkle in my eye or radiance in my skin, but instead were sucking the life out of me.
I’m forever grateful that every time I go shopping now I carry my colors with me in my purse and I shop color FIRST!
I save time, money, and energy which helps me enjoy the things that matter the most – my family and my career.
I get compliments all the time from strangers “That color looks good on you!” And I owe it all to Color Guru!
Here are the answers to some of our most frequently asked questions. You can also ask us anything in the chat box in the lower right corner!
It’s simple!
We’ll take it from there! We examine your questionnaire and study the colors in your eyes, lips, cheeks, hair, and skin. We look at your overt coloring as well as undertones, highlights in the hair, flecks in the eyes, etc. Then, we analyze your photo a second time using our exclusive Color Guru tests.
You’ll receive a copy of these tests in your Color Radiance Report.
You’ll also receive a digital and laminated version of your color card, which looks like this:
You’ll receive two versions of your color palette card – a digital version for your phone and a laminated version for your purse or pocket.
Take either one shopping with you, and simply scan the clothing racks for your colors!
Now, you’ll know that you’re buying a color that’s flattering on you.
For patterned, or multi-colored clothing, we recommend a simple rule of thumb – if the pattern has 75% or more the colors on your card, go for it!
If you shop within your color card, you’ll eventually have a completely coordinated wardrobe! Here’s a closet filled with Calm Autumn colors.
We got this question so many times that we partnered with makeup artist, Leisa Kanienberg of imakeupartistry, to create a line of Color Guru Makeup Cards.
Our goal was to create cards that simplify the makeup buying process for you. These are “go-to” color choices for your season type – match the color to whatever makeup brand you prefer.
Here is a sample makeup card. Leisa is our makeup guru!
Yes!
But…only because we gather a lot of information from you before we perform your consultation. We require several photos of you. This way, we can see how you show up in different lighting. If we can’t see what we’re looking for in the photos you submit, we’ll bug you to send more 🙂
We also require you to fill out a questionnaire, where you tell us about your hair color as a child, how your skin reacts to the sun, describe your eye color, etc. All of this information informs our analysis.
The color palette we give you will have 5 colors with names on them. These are your Mood Colors. Color can have a major impact on how you are perceived and what “feel” you are projecting. Here is a sample color card so that you can see the Mood Colors. Just look for the colors with names on them.
You’ll have your results in two business days!

However, as we age, we all lose warmth and natural color in our skin and hair.
So, for some people (about 20%) who are toward the center of the warm/cool spectrum to begin with, this can mean a change in their season type.
Example: Laurie changed from an Autumn type to a Summer type as her hair went grey.

130,https://yourcolorguru.com/are-you-a-spring/,"I love hearing people say “Spring has sprung!”
I live in Delaware, and after going through a long, cold winter (Missourians are rolling their eyes right now) there is nothing like the sight of that first crocus at the very start of Spring. Those first daffodils, tulips, and leaves sprouting from tree branches, Spring signifies LIFE!
And just like the colors of Spring, a true Spring color palette is full of shades that are Warm, Bright, and Clear.
What are Spring colors?
A Spring seasonal color palette is full of warm and bright shades like poppy red, daffodil yellow, and tangerine orange. Some of the neutral Spring colors are ivory, cream, camel, and clearer browns. Spring clothing colors are happy, joyful colors!
There are 3 different coloring patterns that we see in Spring types, and that they each need a unique Spring seasonal color palette. Are these palettes entirely different? No. There are definitely colors that overlap – some of the neutrals do, but there are some important differences in the other colors depending on that particular Spring’s skin tone, hair, and eye color. Spring palettes vary, depending on their dominant quality – light, warm, or bright.
Here’s how we break down the types:
Sunlit Spring – The light Spring color palette
Copper Spring – The warm Spring color palette
Vivid Spring – The bright Spring color palette (or sometimes referred to as the “clear Spring color palette”
Here is an example of a our Copper Spring color palette:
How do we determine your Spring season colors?
First, we always do a broad color analysis based on your photos (we require at least 7!) and the answers you give us in the questionnaire. If you’re identified as a Spring type in the broad seasonal color analysis, then we do a much more specific Spring seasonal color analysis to determine which of the 3 types of Spring you are. This gets you in the exact right Spring palette for your unique coloring.
A few classic Spring color schemes from the Spring colors palette that would work for all of the 3 types would be:
Teal, Ivory, Watermelon Pink
Bright Navy, Wheat, Spring Blue
Poppy Red, Ivory, Sweet Peach
Spring celebrities include:
Kate Hudson (Sunlit Spring)
Amy Adams (Copper Spring)
Blake Lively (Vivid Spring)
The exact right Spring season colors for each of the 3 seasonal types highlights their natural beauty!

131,https://yourcolorguru.com/are-you-a-summer-seasonal-type/,"Each seasonal type has it’s own unique beauty and it’s own beautiful color palette, and for Summer types, the best Summer colors are Cool, Light, and Muted.
What are Summer colors? A summer season color palette is full of soft colors like pastels, some great neutral colors like soft white, charcoal grey, navy, and taupe, and some rich colors as well like cranberry, evergreen, and plum.
We noticed pretty quickly that there are 3 different coloring patterns that we see in Summer types, and that they each need a unique summer seasonal color palette. Are these palettes entirely different? No. There are definitely colors that overlap, but there are some important distinctions on their unique palettes depending on the summer’s skin tone, hair, and eye color. Summer palettes vary, depending on their dominant quality – light, cool, or soft.
Here’s how we break down the types:
Sunlit Summer – The lightest of the Summer types
Moonlit Summer – The coolest of the Summer types
Calm Summer – The softest of the Summer types
Here is an example of a our Sunlit Summer palette:
Colors for summer skin tone include soft white, charcoal gray, light blues, light pinks, cranberry red, and navy to name a few. Turquoise, Raspberry, and Teal Blue are a few of the bright Summer colors.
A few classic Summer color combinations that would work for all of the 3 types would be:
Baby pink, dove gray, soft white
Navy, soft white, baby blue
Charcoal gray, cranberry, soft white
Summer celebrities include:
Reese Witherspoon (Sunlit Summer)
Amanda Peet (Moonlit Summer)
Alicia Silverstone (Calm Summer)

What are Winter colors?
A true Winter color palette is full of cool based jewel-tones like ruby red, sapphire blue, and emerald green. Winter types also get such classic neutrals – they look beautiful in black, crisp white, and navy to name a few. A true Winter palette is full of colors that lean crisp, cool, and highly saturated. As a color season Winter, you look amazing in high contrast. That means the colors you wear are more different from each other than they are similar. Here is a visual representation of high contrast versus low contrast.
High Contrast outfit – black, white, red
Low contrast outfit – shades of blue
But all winter colors are not highly contrasting! While the Winter palette should be mostly clear, saturated colors, Winter types can also wear well a few carefully selected pastels very well. Pastel winter color palette colors include: baby blue, soft pink, sea glass green, and light lavender.
Here is a Winter type in a softer blue, and it’s quite beautiful!
There are 3 different coloring patterns that we see in Winter types, and that they each need a unique Winter colors palette. Are these palettes entirely different?

Here’s how we break down the types:
Moonlit Winters – The cool Winter color palette (sometimes referred to as the Cool Winter palette)

As for Autumn seasonal type, each seasonal type has it’s own unique beauty and it’s own beautiful color palette. For Autumn types, a true Autumn color palette is full of shades that are Warm, Deep, and Muted.
What is an Autumn color palette?
An Autumn season color palette is full of warm colors like mustard yellow, eggplant purple, and pumpkin orange. Some of the neutral Autumn colors are ivory, cream, khaki, olive green, and brown. True Autumn color palette clothing is warm, rich, and earthy – think of the colors of the fall leaves, the bark of the trees, and the deep evergreens.
There are 3 different coloring patterns that we see in Autumn types, and that they each need a unique Autumn seasonal color palette. Are these palettes entirely different? No. There are definitely colors that overlap – most of the neutrals do, but there are some important differences in the other colors depending on that particular Autumn’s skin tone, hair, and eye color. Autumn palettes vary, depending on their dominant quality – soft, warm, or deep.
Here’s how we break down the types:
Calm Autumn – The soft Autumn color palette
Copper Autumn – The warm Autumn color palette
Twilight Autumn – The deep Autumn color palette (or sometimes referred to as the Dark Autumn color palette)
Here is an example of a our Copper Autumn color palette:
(fall season image)
How do we determine your seasonal color type?
First, we always do a broad color analysis based on your photos (we require at least 7!) and the answers you gave us in the questionnaire. If you’re identified as an Autumn type in the broad seasonal color analysis, then we do a much more specific Autumn seasonal color analysis to determine which of the 3 types of Autumn you are. This gets you in the exact right Autumn palette for your unique coloring.
A few classic Autumn color combinations that would work for all of the 3 types would be:
Olive green, ivory, pumpkin orange
Chocolate brown, cream, wheat
Twilight teal, pimento, peony
Autumn celebrities include:
Emma Watson (Calm Autumn)
Julianne Moore (Copper Autumn)
Eva Longoria (Twilight Autumn)
The exact right Autumn season colors for each of the 3 seasonal types highlights their natural beauty!
The Autumn colors palette is so beautiful, rich, and warm! If you’re one of the 3 true Autumn types, you’ll find that one of the 3 Autumn color palettes will suit you perfectly!",colorguru
134,https://yourcolorguru.com/are-you-warm-or-cool/,"Discovering whether you’re warm-toned or cool-toned overall can help you understand why certain colors make you glow, and others well…don’t.
These two celebrities are great examples of an extremely warm-toned person versus an extremely cool-toned person.
Julianne Moore is WARM. Red hair, peaches and cream skin, and warm golden green eyes puts her on the far side of the WARM spectrum. This is why she looks so stunning in this tomato red color – this is a version of red that has a lot of orange in it, making it very warm.
Katy Perry is COOL. Black hair, (at least in this photo, she loves to change her hair color!) porcelain skin, and cool blue eyes put her on the far side of the COOL spectrum. This is why she looks so amazing in this cobalt blue color, which is a cool color.
So, if everyone were a Julianne or Katy, seasonal color analysis would be quite easy! And if you look just like one of these ladies coloring-wise, then you’re in luck, and you now know whether you’re warm or cool.
However, here’s the catch! MOST people have a mix of both warm and cool features, and this is where you need a trained eye to clarify where you are on that spectrum.
Our color consultations not only show you whether you’re WARM or COOL, but determine whether you look better in LIGHT or DEEP colors, and CLEAR or MUTED colors. We do an in depth study of the photos you submit, and bring that all together to determine your ideal color palette!

Get out these Summer colors from your wardrobe.
Colors for All Summers
There’s a variety of colors that will compliment you in the fall. Whether you’re a Sunlit, Moonlight, or a Calm Summer, there’s a color out there to compliment you. Some of us are forever our season and want our colors to be the same way. These colors will help you look gorgeous while keeping those colors that compliment you.
Powerful and Dynamic Color
My number one recommendation is Navy. It’s one of the best neutral colors. In the Summertime your ideal navy shade is light, not a dark navy. It’s important to know the difference. If it’s a navy that almost looks black, it’s not your navy. Get the shade that best compliments you. Light navy is a powerful and dynamic color for Summer.
Popular Color in Stores
Another color that is popular in stores right now is mauve. It is gorgeous for any type of Summer. It helps to bring out your natural cheek and lip color. Keep this in mind when you’re on your next shopping trip!
The Red of Summer
Keep an eye out this year for Cranberry. It’s a Summer’s red. This is one of the deepest colors in your pallet. It’s a beautiful color for you in Fall and Winter. You can pair it with Jeans, a gray sweater, gray boots and silver jewelry. Look stunning this Fall without having to sacrifice your Summer colors.",colorguru

Over the past several months, I’ve been on a journey of reinvention, which includes totally overhauling my style. What an absolute relief to have this fabulous resource as a tool in my reinvention kit. Instead of having to hunt through countless stores and websites trying to find what would look best on me, I have options I already KNOW will work for me...right at my fingertips.
My Color Closet even gives me some new ideas to play around with—fun! And here’s the cherry on top: I don’t have to go on a frustrating hunt through a bunch of stores to find the pieces I like. I know exactly where to find them with a click of my mouse. My Color Closet has me style-winning all over the place!

I was so excited to get My Color Closet; as I love my color season, and the closet exceeded my expectations! The visual look of the closet is appealing and organized. I find something I haven’t seen yet each time I log in.
My closet was updated with new clothes & shoes within a month of starting my membership. I love the different sizing, as for some clothes I’m petite and for others I’m not.
The variety of stores and prices makes shopping easy based on my budget. Finding winter clothes in my summer palette is amazing as it’s been very hard for me to find on my own!

The service has been a revelation. It’s like having a clothes catalog delivered just for me. The items shown in my color closet are perfect for my color type and there are lots of different sizes, shapes and styles included. There really is something for everyone. So far I have bought a dress and confess that I don’t think I would have had the courage to buy it without the inspiration from Your Color Closet. I had been frightened of making more (sometimes expensive) mistakes with clothes, so just bought more jeans and shirts. Now, with the Your Color Closet, I can start filling in the gaps caused by the wardrobe clear-out and know, without a doubt, that the things I buy will be perfect.

To be able to scroll for clothing in my colors has been a game changer. And really the icing on the cake is the extra “How to Style” with an extra “Shop the Look”. It’s almost a no-brainer! The clothing choices are on point and I’m loving it!

So if you’ve ever asked yourself “What colors look good on me?” This article will help you be color wise and understand what color analysis is and how to find a quality consultant so you don’t waste your money and time.
What is Seasonal Color Analysis?
Seasonal color analysis is very simply analyzing your coloring to determine which family of colors will best highlight your natural beauty. Not every person looks good in every color. The wrong colors can wash you out, overpower you, or make you look tired, older, even ill (you probably have seen this when in a dressing room you tried on the wrong shade of yellow!) While the right colors can give you a natural glow, highlight your eye color, hair color, and skin tone, and make your teeth and eyes look brighter and whiter!
Not all analysts do, but at Color Guru, we strongly believe in analyzing skin tone, eye color, AND hair color to determine your ideal season. Some analysts don’t want to include hair because it is the most changeable element. It’s true – a drastic change in hair color can change your season type – however it doesn’t always. We believe the answer is not to ignore hair color altogether because that often leads to an inaccurate season type, but rather consult with your color analyst when considering a hair color change. Often highlights or a color within a few shades of your original color will not change your ideal color palette. Sometimes, but not always, drastic hair color changes might.
What Colors Look Best On Me?
If you’re asking the question “What colors do I look good in?” getting a personal color analysis will answer your question! When the Color Guru team is performing a color analysis, we start by doing an initial personal color test on the photos you submit in order to determine your season colors – Summer, Autumn, Winter, or Spring.
Once your initial color season analysis is complete, we then do a more detailed and in-depth analysis to determine your sub-type. Our sub-types are made of descriptive words that precede the season type: Vivid, Sunlit, Moonlit, Twilight, Calm, and Copper are our sub-types. There are 12 types in all.
What are the Color Seasons – A simplification
This is a very simple overview of the color seasons.
What are Summer Colors?
Summer colors are light, cool, and muted. These are colors for cool skin tones.
What are Autumn Colors?
Autumn colors are deep, warm, and muted. These are colors for warm skin tones.
What are Winter Colors?
Autumn colors are deep, cool, and clear. These are colors for cool skin tones.
What are Spring Colors?
Spring colors are light, warm, and clear. These are colors for warm skin tones.
If you’re asking yourself – “OK, I’m ready! What are my colors?” do your homework and find a high quality color consultant. There is currently no official certifying body for seasonal color analysis, so there are lots of people who call themselves color analysts who have no idea what they’re doing.
3 Questions to Ask Before Getting Your Colors Done
I realize I’m quite biased here, but I’ve seen so many people come through our analysis process who have wasted money and been mis-typed, and I just hate to see that. So consider these 3 questions before you invest in a professional color analysis.
#1 – Ask how many photos they require
If they are asking for 4 photos or less, look for someone else. Remember, they have never seen you before, so all they are seeing is your pictures. Have you ever noticed how different you look in different lighting? Indoors versus outdoors, old hair color versus new, shadows versus sun, artificial light versus natural – it all makes a difference. We require a minimum of 7 photos and we cross check those photos with the coloring information you submit in our questionnaire.
#2 – Ask if your colors will be the same if you are tan in the summer but pale in the winter?
I feel bad – this is a bit of a trick question to weed out the pros from the amateurs. The answer should reveal what they are basing their color analysis on. The answer is yes! Your colors will remain the same even if you’re someone who is pale in the winter and tan in the summer. That’s because all quality color analysis is based on the undertones in your skin, not your overt coloring! Because your undertones never change – (you were born with them and they aren’t going anywhere 🙂 your color palette remains the same year round!
#3 – Ask how long they’ve been doing color analysis.
Colour analysis is half SCIENCE, half ART. Quality color analysis is based in color theory, and there’s lots to learn. But even when you think you know all the science behind color theory, once you start to analyze thousands of people, you see lots of tricky cases – people on the borderlines of 2 seasons, people who don’t fit the patterns you’ve seen before, people who are equally warm and cool, people who are very color neutral, etc. When this happens, EXPERIENCE is key. Just like a hairdresser who learns over time what certain hair types will do or not do, color analysts see what works and doesn’t work with people’s ideal color palettes as well! Ideally, you want someone who has analyzed thousands of people – not just 30 or 40.
Where can I find a color consultant near me?
There’s no need! At Color Guru, we’ve perfected the art and science of virtual color analysis! We’ve been in business for over 10 years, analyzed nearly 10,000 people, and sent our color cards to 27 countries (and counting!) How to know what colors look good on your is as easy as 1,2,3!

172,https://yourcolorguru.com/funeral-little-black-dress/,"I hope the myth of “every woman should have a little black dress” dies a SLOW, PAINFUL death.
Wait, no a FAST, FINAL death. Right here. Right now.
“Every woman should have a little black dress!” Sorry, Tim Gunn, some women can’t take a little black dress and “Make it work.”
(PS, I still LOVE Project Runway, and Tim Gunn, for that matter. I will never tire of the way he says “Lackluster!”)
Here’s the thing though, black is not some magical universal color that everyone can wear. However, it has been sold to us by the fashion industry as such. Black is a cool color, it’s a deep color, and it’s a clear color. If you’ve had your colors done and you’re any variation of winter, you know that cool, deep, and clear is your perfect combo, and you know that you look dynamite in black. If you’re a summer, black isn’t going to be the worst on you (orange and brown are your nemeses – nemesis plural?) However, for any variation of summer, charcoal grey is a much better choice.
AUTUMNS and SPRINGS – Listen Up!
If you’re an Autumn or Spring, then black is going to wash you out my friend. Big time. If this is disappointing for you, I understand. I used to wear black too. I thought I looked chic in it. I read in fashion magazines that it was “slimming.” I felt French. In the end, just like skinny jeans, it’s not for everyone. So take a moment to have a cry, and have a little funeral for the black clothing you own. But don’t wear black to that funeral. You’re better than that now. So, if you’re an Autumn or Spring, what are you to do? What’s your version of “the little black dress?” I’m so glad you asked! Take a look at this model.
This model is a spring, and some of you are probably thinking – hey she looks pretty good in that dress. I’ll tell you why.
- Exhibit A – professional lighting.
- Exhibit B – professional makeup and hair.
- Exhibit C – She’s a model.
If you’re a spring or an autumn and you’re at Uncle Larry’s BBQ, you aren’t going to have any of these advantages. You need to be wearing your correct colors to look your best! (And also, why are you wearing black to a summer BBQ?) I also want to point out that next to the model’s delicate features and warm hair, that the black looks like one big block. Do you ever aspire to be “blocky looking” when you’re going out? I thought not 🙂
Here’s the fact. Even though the model may not look terrible because of these 3 things, she still doesn’t look nearly her best. I’ll prove it to you. Look at her eyes in the teal blue. Look at the gorgeous blush in her skin in the deep rust color. Look at the way her hair shines against the plum.
Same dress, same girl. The right color changes everything, my friends.
Til next time,
BE COLORFUL!",colorguru

Some shades bring out your natural beauty while others may not. It’s important to be aware of what suits you best. The key is knowing how to wear hues that compliment you.
Find the Color That’s Right for You
At Color Guru, we have 12 unique exclusive color pallets. You’ll receive a color card with shades that will compliment you.
Your color card is easy to use. When you’re out shopping, you simply use the card and compare it to the pieces you’re considering.
Only buy the clothes that match the shades on your color pallet. When you start buying clothes that match your color pallet, you notice remarkable results.
Your Clothes Should Compliment YOU!
Your clothes begin to compliment YOU! Not the other way around. When you’re wearing your shades, you see a difference in how your skin and eyes look brighter, your teeth look whiter, and your face is lifted.
Women have said that once they started wearing their colors they received more compliments and feel more confident.
Enjoy Shopping Again
Shopping will begin to become more enjoyable. When you’re at a store it can be very overwhelming with all the options to choose from. With your personalized pallet, you no longer need to feel overwhelmed when you enter a store. After a consultation, you’ll know exactly what colors you need to wear.
Your color pallet will give you a plan for your clothing. No longer do you need to worry about matching shirts and pants. Your wardrobe decisions become effortless. Your clothing will work together and co-ordinate. Know your colors to save yourself time and money. All our consultations are done personally one-on-one.",colorguru

This personal stylist highly recommends this color analysis! Knowing which colors make you glow greatly simplifies shopping – if it doesn’t come in one of your colors, move on.
Here are the answers to some of our most frequently asked questions.
It’s simple!
We’ll take it from there! We examine your questionnaire and study the colors in your eyes, lips, cheeks, hair, and skin. We look at your overt coloring as well as undertones, highlights in the hair, flecks in the eyes, etc. Then, we analyze your photo a second time using our exclusive Color Guru tests.
You’ll receive a copy of these tests in your Color Radiance Report.
You’ll also receive a digital and laminated version of your color card, which looks like this:
Yes!
But… only because we gather a lot of information from you before we perform your consultation. We require several photos of you. This way, we can see how you show up in different lighting. If we can’t see what we’re looking for in the photos you submit, we’ll bug you to send more 🙂
We also require you to fill out a questionnaire, where you tell us about your hair color as a child, how your skin reacts to the sun, describe your eye color, etc. All of this information informs our analysis.
We require 5 photos, with at least one without makeup, but more is always better!
If you are going to take new photos, a great place is actually the front seat of your car! The lighting is usually quite good. There is no need to worry about what colors you are wearing, and glasses are fine. The most important thing is that we can clearly see your hair, skin tone, and eye color.
Yes! We serve everyone. We even did a consultation for a puppy once! But then, puppies look cute in everything… so that was probably a waste of everyone’s time 🙂
Yes! We offer two types of gift cards: email and physical. Just look for the blue “Purchase Gift” button at the bottom of each package.
Email gift cards are sent directly to the recipient and you can choose the date on which you would like the email to be sent.
Physical gift cards are sent through the mail. You can choose for the card to be sent to you, or directly to the recipient. You also have the option to select priority shipping at check-out.
Yes! We ship color cards all over the world and shipping is always FREE!
Color cards are sent through the USPS, just like a regular letter, and should arrive within 7-10 business days (within USA). Please allow 9-14 business days for international shipping. Priority shipping (with tracking number) is available for gift cards only at this time.
We love our process and we think that you will too! On the off chance that you don’t, below is our refund policy.
Try your new colors for 30 days. We firmly believe that even if you are surprised by your results, if you give them a chance, you will see that these new colors can change your life! If 30 days have passed and you’re still not vibing with the process and would like a refund, please submit the following within 90 days of purchase to support@yourcolorguru.com:
Please note that gift packages may only be returned by the purchaser, not by the recipient.
Your color card shows 35 of your season’s best colors. You’ll receive two versions of your color palette card – a digital version for your phone and a laminated version for your purse or pocket.
Take either one shopping with you, and simply scan the clothing racks for your colors!
Now, you’ll know that you’re buying a color that’s flattering on you.
For patterned, or multi-colored clothing, we recommend a simple rule of thumb – if the pattern has 75% or more of the colors on your card, go for it!
If you shop within your color card, you’ll eventually have a completely coordinated wardrobe! Here’s a closet filled with Calm Autumn colors.
Results are emailed within 3 business days of us receiving your questionnaire and photos. If you don’t see your results, please check your spam folder!
We got this question so many times that we partnered with makeup artist, Leisa Kanienberg of imakeupartistry, to create a line of Color Guru Makeup Cards.
Our goal was to create cards that simplify the makeup buying process for you. These are “go-to” color choices for your season type – match the color to whatever makeup brand you prefer.
Makeup cards are included in the Plus and Premium package, or as an optional “add-on” to the Essentials package.
Here is a sample makeup card. Leisa is our makeup guru!
Foundation is very specific to the individual. With so many variables such as personal preference, coverage type, skin type, etc. it’s impossible to provide a “one shade fits all” for each season and subtype.
For 80% of people, no, your season does not change when your hair goes grey.
However, as we age, we all lose warmth and natural color in our skin and hair.
So, for some people (about 20%) who are toward the center of the warm/cool spectrum to begin with, this can mean a change in their season type.
Example: Laurie changed from an Autumn type to a Summer type as her hair went grey.
It might. While adding highlights or staying within 2-3 shades of your natural hair color does not typically change your color palette, a drastic hair color change or transitioning to gray hair can affect your color palette, but doesn’t always.
If you want custom recommendations for hair color, consider the Plus or Premium packages. In the Plus package, you get a 15-minute custom hair color recommendation video! In the Premium consultation, Jeannie (aka the Color Guru) suggests an ideal hair color for you during your 45-minute Zoom consultation.
If you drastically change your hair color within 6 months of your consultation, we’ll take a complimentary 2nd look.
Check out our stylists page to meet Marisa, she exclusively focuses on black and textured hair care techniques! She has been a licensed hair professional for 10+ with half of her experience split between beauty marketing behind the scenes in NYC and servicing clients behind the chair in salon. She is an expert in styling and coloring black and textured hair.
We offer a wide range of items at a variety of price points and we are constantly working to include as many retailers as possible. Some current examples include, but are not limited to Madewell, LOFT, Target, Anthropologie, J Crew, Banana Republic, Macy’s, Nordstrom Rack, and JC Penney.

You’ve got a closet full of clothes, but often something feels off. You’ve tried different styles and clothing combinations, but nothing seems to fix this nagging feeling that your clothes are not quite right. If this sounds like you, it might be time to get your colors done! So often, without even knowing it, wearing the wrong colors is the issue.
Getting your colors done through virtual color analysis is a simple process that can have a massive impact on your appearance and confidence. A personal color analysis that identifies the colors that look best on you, based on your unique skin tone, hair color, and eye color. The seasonal color theory tests performed in the analysis will help you determine the best shades and hues for your wardrobe.
What’s My Seasonal Color Palette?
Having a color analysis for clothing is the first step to discovering your seasonal color palette. An accurate skin color palette (sometimes referred to as a skin tone palette) is essential for understanding your best makeup shades as well. There is help for ideal hair color as well – via custom haircolor consultation.
Asking “What Colors Look Good on Me?” is a question that a professional color analyst can answer for you, and the results have a big impact!
#1 – Better Decision Making – Knowing the colors that look best on you all around can help you make better decisions when shopping for clothes. Instead of buying a shirt because it’s trendy or on sale, you can choose the exact colors that actually look great on you. This means you’ll be more likely to wear the items and feel confident in them.
#2 – Boost Your Confidence – Having a wardrobe full of clothes that look great on you can definitely help boost your confidence. When you know that you look good, you’ll be more likely to put yourself out there and take risks. This could mean speaking up in meetings, networking with new people, or even just going out with friends.
#3 – Develop Your Style – Finally, getting your colors done can help you develop a personal style that’s unique and flattering. Instead of just following trends, you can create a look that’s all your own. You’ll be able to combine pieces in ways that make you look and feel great.
So now you’re probably wondering “What’s my color palette?” How to find what colors look best on you is such a fun process! Seeing your color card for the first time and beginning to “color your style” can really invigorate your wardrobe and sense of style!

Marisa was such a warm person. I felt like I was talking with a friend who happened to be an expert on hair care and color! I really loved how she listened and asked me deeper questions to help me be more clear about what I truly wanted… I got the exact looks that I wanted in my perfect colors to make me shine the most.
Elizabeth
I loved how incredibly thorough Allie was with her suggestions. She clearly had done quite a bit of prep work for the session. She knew my hair type, what would suit me best, and made her suggestions simple and straightforward. This was a great experience, I’m delighted I did this for myself!
Eliza
Allie was extremely informative with her suggestions for me. Not only did she give me the information so that it was easy for me to understand., but she followed up with an email with technical wording that I could share with my personal colorist.
I really appreciated her talking me through why she had chosen what she had!
Michelle
Marisa put me at ease immediately with her warmth and insightful questions. She listened to me while I gave an overview of how I take care of my hair. She was relatable and very empathetic. She not only gave me great ideas about color for my hair (pulling up several photos) but also gave me invaluable information on products to maintain my hair in between visits. This was particularly helpful as I am planning on moving and will face different weather conditions than where I currently live. We also spent time talking about the kinds of flattering cuts I could ask my stylist to do during my next appt. Given the short amount of time for the session, this appt exceeded my expectations! Marisa then followed up with an email reviewing what we discussed. An overall excellent experience.

240,https://yourcolorguru.com/how-to-create-a-coordinated-wardrobe-with-seasonal-color-analysis/,"A coordinated wardrobe is the bonus on the back end of getting a color consultation. Most don’t expect it, but it’s a lovely surprise! Your clothes all start to “go” together. It kinda feels like magic.
This is a photo from my closet. I have less clothes than ever, but I wear all of them and love them! Now, I also have some drawers and shelves, but these are all of my hanging clothes for fall/winter.
I call it my fall/winter capsule wardrobe, but it just sort of happened when I started wearing my best colors exclusively.
I know that most people come to me with the question “Which of the color seasons will suit me best?” They want the colors that make them look their best and feel confident when choosing colors. But, as a professional color analyst, I can confidently say that not ONLY is your personal color palette the colors that will be most flattering on you, but its also a plan for your wardrobe. It is the key to building your wardrobe in a smart way, so that outfits not only flatter you, but are easy to put together.
A well thought out capsule wardrobe, on the other hand, really works for us because it’s designed with intention. I tried to create one for years and was unsuccessful until I learned my best colors. There were a few places that, now looking back, I see I went wrong.
What doesn’t work for trying to create a capsule wardrobe…
#1 – I printed out a capsule wardrobe checklist – The problem here is that I was basically copying someone else’s idea of what I should have in my closet. Example – in this capsule wardrobe list, they recommended a black blazer. I don’t wear black, and I work from home and never wear blazers, so yeah… They recommended a crisp white button down. I couldn’t find one that didn’t feel too stiff. No one can tell you what your “essentials for a capsule wardrobe” should be except you. And all it takes is a little time figuring out what works for you and your lifestyle.
#2 – I tried the “neutral thing” – At the end of the day, I’m just not a neutrals gal. Some women are, and genuinely love wearing black, grey, white, and beige all the time. I can not. I get sooooo bored. I don’t even have one single black and white picture in my house. So, while sure, I might choose a few capsule wardrobe basics in a few neutrals, I want to see lots of gorgeous, rich colors when I fling open my closet doors.
#3 – I believed others were doing it perfectly – Social media got the best of me. Everyone’s capsule wardrobe looked so perfect, and I bought it for a while. But then I realized, clothing is always going to be a shifting thing. We gain a little weight, we lose a little weight, our favorite top gets a ketchup stain, our jeans wear out, we stop liking the way something fits, etc. Somehow I thought if I bought into the idea that I could create something perfect that would sort of stay…well…perfect. Nope. Impossible.
Lots of people are looking for a sustainable capsule wardrobe plan, I was. And it’s no wonder. Fast fashion has become the norm in our culture and clothes are so easy and cheap to buy, that if we aren’t intentionally mindful, we end up with closets that are packed…but still don’t really work for us.
Do you prefer to have lots and lots of clothes to choose from and rotate them very often? Or do you prefer to choose each item carefully, thinking about how long it will last, if you really like it, and if it will coordinate with the rest of your clothes? If you absolutely love a bright yellow and red printed top, but have absolutely nothing to wear it with, its a waste of money, so the coordination piece is a pretty big deal.
I’ve helped people in their closets for years, and one thing I’ve seen over and over again is a closet full of pieces that don’t work together. Confusion when dressing ensues. Your color palette is a family of colors, designed to work together, so your wardrobe concept is done for you colorwise! When you buy clothes only in your color palette, I’ve had so many clients tell me “I never expected my color personal color analysis to create a capsule wardrobe for me” But there it is!
The Secret of a Perfect Capsule Wardrobe for me turned out to be just knowing my colors! I know it sounds too simple, but knowing your best colors makes you really picky about what you let into your closet. If that shade of blue isn’t going to look good on you, why have it? Suddenly, I had standards for what I brought into my closet. I de-cluttered my closet and I stopped buying color mistakes. Sometimes, I went on a shopping trip and only came home with one perfect thing. Damn, it felt GOOD! When I shopped, I knew what I was looking for – clothes in my color. And then, simply, did I like the way they fit, and was it “my style”. Shopping became a treasure hunt for my colors!
So Here are My Capsule Wardrobe Must Haves:
#1 – Clothes in my best colors
#2 – Clothes that feel good and look good on my body
#3 – Clothes that are my “style”
Boom. Done!

241,https://yourcolorguru.com/how-to-look-good-on-zoom/,"So many of us are suddenly doing Zoom chats to connect with fellow workers and also family and friends.
Here are 3 Quick Tips for looking better on your Zoom chats:
1) Wear a color that contrasts with your background. If the wall behind you is beige, and you’re wearing a beige sweater, you’ll just faaaaaade into the background. So, if you’re background is neutral, choose a bright pop of color – it will brighten your viewer’s day too!
2) The most universally flattering neckline is a V-neck. Doesn’t matter if it’s a short V-neck or a deep V, but a V-neck instantly creates a beautiful shape! Just don’t go too low if you’re Zoom-chatting with Grandma Millie…
3) Did you know that Zoom has a “touch up my appearance” setting? I didn’t! And I’ve been using Zoom for years! Just tap “settings” and then “touch up my appearance.” I got this tip from @ars_magna – my favorite Boston-based photographer.",colorguru

243,https://yourcolorguru.com/love-it-or-hate-it-a-color-analysis-quiz-is-likely-a-waste-of-your-time/,"Once people understand the massive difference wearing the right colors for them can make, their next step is finding out what their own colors are. Enter the online color analysis quiz – the simplest and (spoiler alert!) least accurate way to determine your best colors.
Why am I throwing shade at color analysis quizzes?
#1 Let me share with you the message I get over and over again – in my DM’s, in my email, and to the Color Guru support inbox. It goes like this: I did a color quiz and got my seasonal type, but I don’t think these colors look good on me! I keep trying them and it’s just not working. Please help.”
A color palette quiz is designed to determine a person’s seasonal type and are becoming increasingly popular. However, despite their popularity, experts in the field of color analysis agree that these quizzes are often inaccurate and can lead to incorrect identification of a person’s seasonal type.
If for example, if one of those quizzes puts someone in the wrong summer color palette, it’s likely they will look washed out. Summer seasonal color analysis has to be done so carefully. They all do – Spring, Autumn, Winter. But back to our summer example – what does it mean when a color washes you out? It means it’s not aligned with your skin, hair, and eyes in a flattering way, often the issue with looking washed out is that the color is not the right saturation level for your features. The wrong colors can make you look older, tired, washed out, overwhelmed, or even ill. The right colors have the power to make you look glowing and highlight your best features.
#2 The second problem with seasonal color analysis quizzes is that the questions are often too vague or subjective. For example, a question might ask the user to choose the color that is closest to their hair color from a selection of photos. However, the selection of photos may not include their actual hair color.
Plus, can the quiz algorithm determine the undertones in the hair color? What if they dye their hair often? What if they are in the process of going grey? What if their hair is dark in the winter, but in the summer gets natural golden highlights from the sun? And that’s only the hair part, not even taking into account the question of skin tone or eye color, which are also an important part of the process and quite hard to nail from looking at a series of photos. One incorrect answer can lead to flawed results and a misidentification of that person’s seasonal type.
#3 Color analysis quizzes are often based on outdated ideas and theories about color. Older color palettes sometimes have colors that aren’t find-able in stores. Older systems often lump everyone into only 4 types, which isn’t nearly specific enough to give someone an accurate palette that highlights their hair, skin, and eye color.
In conclusion, as with everything, you get what you pay for. However, the wonderful thing about a plunking down a little bit of cash for an experienced professional color analyst to do your colors is that you can be confident that your results will be accurate. You won’t waste time and money buying the wrong shades for you, and you’ll start to look gorgeous darling – in everything you wear!

245,https://yourcolorguru.com/naming-our-colors/,"I occasionally get asked from people who have had color consultations and gotten their Color Guru color cards, “Do these colors have names?” Hmmm…they didn’t. And I was avoiding giving them names for a few reasons:
1. I didn’t want to give them boring, obvious names like “light pink.” I wanted each color to feel special because I believe each color IS special!
2. I didn’t want to name them myself. Not because I don’t love the idea of naming colors – I do! I’m totally envious of those people who get to name the Benjamin Moore paint colors – how fun! However, I knew that I could never name them as well on my own as I could with help from the Color Guru Community.
3. I wasn’t sure how I could add names to the current design of the color cards. I like to keep the cards simple, portable, and uncluttered. I finally decided that we will not add the names to the cards at this time, but that the color names will be available on the website (coming soon!)

260,https://yourcolorguru.com/not-your-mothers-seasonal-color-analysis/,"Often, when I tell people I’m a professional color analyst, they ask “Wait…is that what my Mom had done in the 80’s/90’s?” Well, yes…and no.
When I was looking for someone to do my colors for the first time, I had such a hard time finding seasonal color analysis near me. And I’m in the Philadelphia area, so a major US city!
I finally found someone who could do my first color analysis consultation in 2011, and it was from a color analysis system that was started in the 1980’s.
The woman doing the seasonal colour analysis test on me was only choosing between 4 different color palettes, and I knew deep down that only choosing between 4 seasons couldn’t possibly be specific enough.
There was only:
An Autumn color palette – a deep, warm toned color palette
A Winter colors palette – a deep, cool toned color palette
A Spring color palette – a light, warm toned color palette
and a Summer colors palette – a light, cool toned color palette
The professional color analyst determined that I was an Autumn, and I did absolutely look great in about half the colors she recommended, but the other half didn’t look so great. I learned later when I began to intensely study color analysis that this was because I was on the borderline of Autumn and Summer.
The other issue was that because the color palette had been created in the early 1980’s, I couldn’t find a lot of the colors in stores because those colors were just not available anymore.
What is the best color analysis system?
The best color analysis system is based on both a science and an art.
Helping people find their personal color palette is based in color theory. The science is the color theory. The art is the experience gained over years of doing color analysis and knowing exactly what to look for so that the client never looks overwhelmed or washed out by the color they are wearing.
There have been several seasonal colour analysis systems over the past 50 years. And like any service, important improvements continue to be made.
We had 3 big intentions when we created the Color Guru system.
The 3 F’s – Flattering, Findable, Fun
Flattering
When we created the Color Guru system of online seasonal color analysis, we knew we needed more than four seasons, so we broke it down further to honor the wide variety of skin, hair, and eye color that we see from our customers on a daily basis.
We came up with 12 color categories:
Summer seasonal color analysis is now broken down into:
Sunlit Summer, Moonlit Summer, and Calm Summer
Winter seasonal color analysis is now broken down into:
Twilight Winter, Moonlit Winter, and Vivid Winter
Autumn seasonal color analysis is now broken down into:
Twilight Autumn, Copper Autumn, and Calm Autumn
Spring seasonal color analysis is now broken down into:
Vivid Spring, Copper Spring, Sunlit Spring
Findable
We knew that we had to give people modern colors that they could actually find in stores. We could not include dated colors that couldn’t be found anymore.
Fun
We knew we wanted the entire color analysis process to be fun! So we created a company that is fresh, modern, affordable, unpretentious, and friendly!

289,https://yourcolorguru.com/save-500-this-year-by-getting-your-colors-done/,"Have you ever heard that most people only wear 20% of what is in their closet? It’s true! Don’t you find yourself grabbing the same stuff over and over again?
Meanwhile, you’re ignoring all of these clothes that you spent good money on. You try it on, you take it back off. It just doesn’t feel right. Why don’t you want to wear those clothes? You aren’t even sure.
I’m speaking from personal experience here. For the longest time, my cluttered closet left me frustrated. I wasn’t wearing more than half of my clothes, so why did I buy them in the first place? I felt guilty for the money I’d wasted, but I couldn’t help it, I did not want to wear those clothes!
Here’s the thing. No one teaches us how to buy what is actually right for us, clothing-wise. Most women are taught to impulse shop. I know I was. Go the the clothing store, browse around, and buy what you like in the moment. 2 weeks later, you try and wear it…and hmmm…you don’t really like it anymore. What happened? Impulse buy regret strikes again.
The average American woman spends in the $2000 – $3000 per year on clothes. And if half of them end up being things we don’t want to wear, that’s $1000 – $1500 of wasted money.
Now not all of these mistakes are color mistakes, but some of them are! That’s why I estimate the average person who does a virtual color analysis saves $500 per year. Very simply, once you know your color style via online seasonal color analysis, you only buy colors that are wonderful on you! You stop making color mistakes. You stop buying colors that will wash you out, overwhelm you, and make you look older, tired, even sick!
Now, back in the 1980’s, there was only 4 season color analysis based on a skin color palette. They used to cover the hair with a towel! When we were creating the Color Guru system, we saw very quickly that only 4 seasons based on skin tone color palettes were not nearly diverse enough to properly assess the wide variety of skin tones we saw in our clients. Beyond that, we saw clearly that you can’t just base color analysis on skin tone only. For the best and most accurate analysis, you must take into account skin, hair, and eye color. So we created 12 unique seasonal types and the right seasonal color analysis test to go with each one. Actually, we developed several season color tests.
When I was first diving into online color analysis, it was because my aunt had told me that I was wearing “all the wrong colors”. She told me I needed a color consultation. “What is a color consultation?” Is it like a color season quiz? I had taken a free personal color analysis test online once, but it hadn’t really helped much.
So, I tried to find a color analysis near me in the Philadelphia area. I was really surprised when I couldn’t find anyone who was providing this service in person! Philly is a major US city, and all I was looking for was a person to provide a personal color analysis test for me.
I finally found a retired image consultant who gave me me first set of colors. Even though they were dated, left over from the 80’s colors, it was still a game changer for my wardrobe! I could not believe the difference in how I looked, the number of compliments I was getting, and how my clothes started to work together!
That’s when I became obsessed with creating my own system for how to determine seasonal color analysis! I studied every color analysis system out there, dove into and trained in makeup shades, hair color, and most of all, clothing colors! And now, we give you, our clients, your personal color cards, which we are so proud of!
Seasonal color analysis is BACK! And it will save you money each year to come to know your colors! The feedback we hear most often? “I wish I had done this YEARS ago!”",colorguru
290,https://yourcolorguru.com/seasonal-color-analysis-is-an-easy-instant-makeover/,"People never expect the massive difference wearing the right colors makes. I’ll show you a few photo examples in this blog so you can see for yourself, but first, let’s talk a little bit more about why seasonal color analysis makes such a big difference.
Wearing your best colors is the fastest and easiest way to look better.
The wrong colors can wash you out.
What does it mean when a color washes you out? As a color analyst, I hear this question all the time. Well, here’s a perfect example. After her color analysis with us, our customer Iris came to us with before and after photos that truly blew us away.
Here are her before photos, where she tended to wear cool, muted earth tones, dark tones, and some pastels. Here’s she’s wearing some of the tones that are in the Summer color palette.
But even though a random online color palette quiz or untrained eye might put her in these colors, Iris is not a Summer type…
Seasonal color analysis is an art and a science.
Now, as soon as we saw Iris’ coloring here at the Color Guru, we knew that she would look her best in bright, clear, warm colors – the Spring colors palette. These cool, muted tones in the BEFORE photos were washing her out.
Here’s the thing – these cool, muted tones don’t wash everyone out! On some people, they look absolutely amazing and highlight their natural beauty. But on Iris, these tones were BLAH.
After our initial analysis of the 7 photos Iris submitted, we knew Iris was a Spring. After our more in depth analysis, we knew Iris was a Sunlit Spring! She’s the lightest of the Spring types, and here is the color palette we gave her:
And here are the results on Iris. I mean, I based my whole business around seasonal color analysis because I believe in it so strongly, but even I was completely blown away by the difference!
Looking for an easy, instant makeover?
Getting a quality seasonal color analysis from a reputable color analyst is the easiest way to transform your look for the better! The makeover affects not only how you look, but is a closet makeover as well since the color palette we give you is a family of colors that work together! Everything starts to coordinate effortlessly.
How do I find color analysis near me?
To answer the question “Which season are you?” you don’t need to search for a color analyst near you or take your chances with an inaccurate online seasonal color analysis quiz.
Color Guru is a virtual 12 color seasons service that has served people in 26 countries and counting! Over the last 10 years, we’ve become the most reliable and best color analysis system available online.
Our seasonal analysis process is simple! Answer a few questions, submit 7 photos, and in 3 business days you’ll have your color results delivered right to your inbox! Learn more at www.yourcolorguru.com/get-started",colorguru
291,https://yourcolorguru.com/seasonal-color-analysis-is-the-key-to-a-capsule-wardrobe/,"I always wanted an organized wardrobe where everything coordinated with everything else. That was not my reality for most of my life though. My reality was a closet full of mismatched stuff that I didn’t like all that much, and never seemed to go together!
Looking back, now that I’m a professional color analyst, I know that it’s because I had a smattering of so many different seasons in my closet – summer colors palette, winter color palette, spring colors palette, and autumn colors palette! No wonder my clothes didn’t match together well!
I knew what I wanted – an affordable capsule wardrobe where everything in my closet looked great on me and coordinated together. Was that so much to ask? I didn’t think so…
I looked at some capsule wardrobe inspiration online, and wasn’t too excited by what I saw. A lot of the capsule wardrobes were all neutrals – black, white, beige, grey. Yawn.
I already knew for sure that black was not a good color for my particular skin tone, so black was out. Plus, some of the capsule wardrobes were SUPER minimalist, and while I definitely wanted to pare down, I didn’t want a hardcore minimalist capsule wardrobe either.
Plus, I wanted to wear COLOR! Not just neutrals.
Well, here is one of the best secrets of a capsule wardrobe – the clothes don’t all have to be neutrals, they just have to be a family of colors that work together! And that’s what we created with our seasonal color analysis system, which we (biased, I know) think is the best color analysis system available on the internet.
The Color Guru is not just another color analysis quiz. We view color analysis as an ART and a SCIENCE.
Because a seasonal color analysis quiz is automated, it can only view it from the “science” perspective. Example – if a color palette quiz asks you your hair color, and you enter “brown” how does the quiz determine which shade of brown, what the undertones are, and how it contrasts with your hair, skin, and eye color? I hate to get all “hater” on the concept of an online color analysis quiz, but I have seen so many people mis-typed and misled through them! We see brown hair in every single season – we see Summer types with brown hair, Autumn types with brown hair, Winter and Spring types with brown hair. “Brown hair” is not enough. What makes the biggest difference is the nuances that a computer can’t spit out an answer to.
Season color theory is something you gain expertise with over time, and we have 12 color seasons to fit the vast variety of coloring we see in our customers.
I got off on a tangent there, but to come back to my main point – don’t try to plan a capsule wardrobe without starting with a quality seasonal analysis! It’s a family of colors that go together so that you don’t have to worry about your clothing not matching. It’s a game changer! It’s the KEY to a capsule wardrobe! Here is an example of one of our 12 color cards, so you can see how well the colors coordinate! Plus, your color palette has the best colors for your hair, skin, and eyes, so you always feel beautiful and confident in what you wear!",colorguru
292,https://yourcolorguru.com/sewing-lately/,"More of us are picking up that needle and thread since Covid-19 has shut down the tailors and seamstresses. I’m sad for these small businesses.
I’m also happy that some people are getting their hands back in sewing and mending because it is such a satisfying and calming practice.
Have you ever sewed a button back onto a shirt, making it wearable again?
Have you ever shortened the straps on a sundress to make it fit your body more beautifully?
Have you ever hemmed pants (I’m 5’1″, so I’ve hemmed pretty much ALL of my pants) for you or your children?
Most women I talk to find this a very satisfying practice. Because we are working with our hands and making something useful or beautiful. It’s also calming and grounding to sew or mend.
I’m thinking about putting together a very basic free course in sewing and mending. Is this something you’d be interested in?

294,https://yourcolorguru.com/shine/,"Recently, I had 2 Premium Color Radiance Consultations, and both women felt so excited and connected to the colors I showed them!
They both happened to be Summers, but different variations – a Sunlit Summer and a Moonlit Summer. Both said the same thing in different words. Essentially, they said that the colors felt like home to them, like they just didn’t quite trust their instincts before, but if they had, their instincts would have led them to this palette.
I think we can be a little bit scared of the power of our own beauty. If you’re not ready to be seen and show up fully, it’s probably not time for a color consultation.
I notice that I continually attract women who are ready for a change in their lives, or are already in the process of change.
Some want to simplify their wardrobes. Some want to shop more mindfully, in a more sustainable way. Some are just ready to stop hiding in boring, colorless clothes. Some are ready to see their incredible beauty and let the world see it too.
Either way, the feedback I continually get is that the color consultation gives them the confidence to SHINE in colors that reveal their natural beauty in a new way.

307,https://yourcolorguru.com/spark-joy-is-great-for-the-kitchen-bad-for-the-closet/,"First, let me preface this by saying I freaking LOVE Marie Kondo.
Her “Does it Spark Joy?” question has transformed my home in so many ways! I did a kitchen declutter, I did a playroom declutter, I did a garage declutter! All paid off big time, and I love my home so much more since she came out with that genius little book – The Lifechanging Magic of Tidying Up – where she introduced the method now called Konmari.
I’m amazed by Marie Kondo for so many reasons. I mean, first, she’s got two small children and her signature wardrobe color is WHITE. How does she pull that off? Do they not eat ketchup or peanut butter? Maybe her kids live on marshmallows and white Tic Tacs?
I still use the Konmari method to declutter closets throughout my house – hall closet, the bathroom closet, the storage closet, however, I have found after using it myself and working with clients in their closets, that the one place is doesn’t work well is in the clothing closet.
While Does it Spark Joy is a great question for your closet, if it is the ONLY question you’re asking, you’re going to be in trouble.
Why?
- Clothing is personal – Much more personal than a spatula or a picture frame, clothing holds memories. There is that top you wore the last time you nursed your youngest baby. The sweater your grandmother knitted for you. The dress you wore on the first date with your now-husband. I find it hard to separate what sparked joy and what sparked memories – and those are two different things. And while sure, you may not want to ever get rid of that sweater your grandmother knitted for you, and that’s totally fine, but it’s possible that your closet gets so filled with memory clothes, clothes you wish you still fit into, fantasy clothes (like the big dramatic beach hat you bought to wear on vacation before you realized there was no way you could fit it into your carry on – gulp – been there!) that your closet gets really confusing, containing things you actually don’t wear.
- Clothing needs to work together – Do you care if your oven mitts match your dish towels? I don’t. Do you care if your bath mat matches your toothbrush? For most of us, nope. But here’s the thing – I DO care that my pants match my tops. And the problem with only asking “Does it Spark Joy?” in your closet is that you can end up with 100 pieces of clothing that spark joy, but don’t work together. For a wardrobe to be functional, the pieces have to go together.
- You might get rid of much needed basics – This was my biggest problem when doing a closet declutter. When I just used the question – Does it Spark Joy? I judged my clothes on whether or not they “excited” me. Well, I got rid of some things that I saw later I shouldn’t have. There was that rather boring neutral pair of shoes that didn’t fill me with glee when I looked at them, but they were crazy comfortable, matched everything, and were my go-to pair of shoes. And I still miss them! Like that friend from kindergarten who has always been SO good to you, and who you kind of took for granted… Did those shoes spark joy? Well, not really in the sense that they excited me a ton, but damn I miss them. I kept flashier ones that aren’t nearly as comfortable, and it was a mistake.
Why Konmari and Seasonal Color Analysis work so beautifully together.
As I said before, when decluttering closets, “Does it Spark Joy” isn’t a bad question to ask – it’s just not the ONLY question you should ask. I do think KonMari and seasonal color analysis are a match made in heaven! And when you’re decluttering clothes, I’d recommend asking these questions in this order.
- Is this one of my best colors? If you’ve had a color consultation and you’ve committed to wearing your best colors, and this isn’t one of them, now you’ve got an outlier in your wardrobe. See, your color palette is a family of colors that is designed to work together. When you stick with it when buying clothes, outerwear, shoes, and accessories, now everything in your closet coordinates beautifully. This saves so much time putting together outfits!
- Do I like the way this fits my body? And the important part here is “Do I like it?” Your mom may love the way something fits you, or your friend swears you look “so hot” in it, but if it makes you feel self-conscious or uncomfortable in any way, it will sit there, taking up precious room in your wardrobe. Don’t settle for clothing that doesn’t feel good to YOU.
- Does it fulfill an important need? Some clothes aren’t flashy, fun clothes, and they may not spark joy. I have a great undershirt that is boring as heck. It’s fitted, nude, and stretchy. Doesn’t spark joy. However, every time I wear a white blouse, I wear this nude undershirt underneath. It makes it so you can’t see through the white blouse to my bra. It does the job. You likely have these items in your closet too. Those black pants that fit amazingly and go with everything, that white button down that is basic as heck but just looks great every time with every pair of pants you own. Give these items the credit they deserve and keep them around because they get the job done.
- Does it Spark Joy? Thank you Marie Kondo for this one! It is a great question to ask, and it really helps you identify what types of things you may want more of or less of in your life! This, and the other questions above, can help you achieve a decluttered closet that you truly love!",colorguru

344,https://yourcolorguru.com/the-hanger-hack-for-an-easy-capsule-wardrobe/,"Some people are pretty extreme with their minimalist capsule wardrobes. They’ll limit themselves to 30 pieces of clothing that all work together to pare down and simplify their closet. I love looking at their sparse closets on Pinterest and their capsule wardrobe checklists – white button down, check, beige blazer, check, pants that can unzip and turn into shorts, check. Those 2 in 1 items give you serious capsule wardrobe street cred.
Designing a minimalist wardrobe is a great goal, but there are many ways to do it.
I wanted a middle path. I wasn’t exactly sure how to create a capsule wardrobe, but I knew what I didn’t want. I didn’t want overflowing drawers and closet, most of which I didn’t wear. But I also didn’t want to pare down and limit myself to a certain number of items. To me, that felt, well…too limiting. Like, it would be stressful if I bought a top, and now my number was 31. Was I still a minimalist?
So I created my own way, and that was 6 years ago and I still use it to this day.
I call it very simply “the hanger trick”. It’s really simple. I decided to go about building a wardrobe I loved, I needed some boundaries.
#1 – I bought a set of 50 hangers that were all the same (if you don’t have hangers that are all the same, it is SO nice to see everything hanging so neatly! You’ll never go back. With just that one upgrade, you’ll be surprised how suddenly your closet looks like…a Marie Kondo closet! Ok, maybe not quite, but it’s pretty great.
#2 – I put only my favorite things in my best colors on those 50 hangers. Knowing your ideal colors is the absolute best way to begin assembling a capsule wardrobe. Once you know your best colors, why would you wear anything else? Plus, you can focus in on a family of colors that all work together, so putting together outfits is a breeze.
#3 – No more hangers – I set a rule that I would not add hangers to my closet.
#4 – One in, one out – If I bought something new that needed a hanger and all my 50 were being used, I had to purge one item to free up a hanger.
#5 – I arrange all my clothes by color – This I do just because it makes me happy to see the colors all grouped together! My color coordinated closet brings me so much joy! Totally not part of the hanger trick…
Basically, I created a scenario where an item of clothing had to “earn” a hanger in my closet. And for me, 50 hanging items is just perfect. It naturally keeps me in check and keeps my wardrobe simple and uncluttered. I also have a few drawers and a set of shelves for jeans, sweaters, socks, pajamas, undies (can you tell I have little kiddos?), etc.
My hanger trick system is so simple, it’s as easy as watching Marie Kondo folding pants! Ok, maybe not quite, but it’s pretty great.
The secrets of a perfect capsule wardrobe is to find what works for you and do that! So if you’ve been struggling with how to make a capsule wardrobe (like I was for a long time), I hope you find the right path for you! A basic capsule wardrobe really does make life easier, especially when you start with a color palette.",colorguru

I’m an Autumn myself so I have an affinity to those beautiful fall colors. Whether you’re a Twilight, a Copper, or a Calm Autumn. All of these colors I’m going to tell you about will look amazing and compliment you. Pantone fall fashion 2017 colors are very popular in stores right now. I’m going to tell you which colors are best to compliment you.
The Red of Autumn
Grenadine is the red for all my autumn ladies. It’s a beautiful tomato red and one of the most vibrant colors in your pallet. Try wearing a dress with the Grenadine color. They are a wonderful option to showcase Grenadine. But be careful where you’re wearing it. You’ll be dropping jaws and catching eyes in no time.
Accessorize Your Autumn
Butter Rum will go great with anything. It’s a fall neutral color you can pull out of your closet and wear with anything. It’s a muted and warm color to wear. Think of a Werther’s Original candy. It’s silky and smooth, just like the color. Try wearing a bag with the Butter Rum color. It makes a great fall bag color.
Bring Out Your Color
Make your fall shine with Maple. There are many out there who have strong or subtle red undertones in their hair color. It’s time to bring out those highlights and color. Maple is a color that will bring those highlights to life. Try wearing a cozy sweater or a pair of jeans in Maple. You’ll be surprised at how neutral this color really is and how much of your wardrobe matches it.
Shine on this season my autumn ladies. Whether you’re shopping for a new wardrobe or you’re looking at your existing wardrobe. Make your clothing decisions a breeze with these beautiful colors that will compliment you.",colorguru

Any winter can wear 5 of the 2017 Pantone fall colors. That’s more than any other season gets! Here are 3 of the 5 colors to wear this season as a winter.
A Favorite Color
Shaded Spruce color is one of my favorites for winters. This color looks great with black or grey basics. You can even pair it with a crisp white. Try a camisole or blazer in this color with a black or crisp white shirt underneath.
Pair Anything in Your Winter Wardrobe
Navy Peony is a medium depth navy that’s a very powerful color on winters. It’s a great neutral color that can pair with anything in your wardrobe. Stop being overwhelmed by what to match. It goes great with any warm colors in your pallet. One of my favorite combinations is navy and cherry red. Try combining the two in a dress for stunning results.
You Can Wear Lighter and Softer Tones
Most people think of winter as deeper jewel tone colors. You don’t need to limit yourself to these colors. There’s still lighter and softer colors that will compliment you. The lighter and softer colors can be used as accent colors instead of your outfit color. A great example of one of these colors is Ballet Slipper. It works great for a camisole and under a blazer or a sweater. You can pair any of these with simple black pants for great results.",colorguru

The right colors can make your skin look brighter, your eyes and teeth look whiter, and give you that natural glow! While the wrong colors for you can drag you down, wash you out, overwhelm you, and even make you look older, tired, and sick!
A color consultation performed by a professional color analyst might be the best investment you ever make to look and feel confident in everything you wear, understand your personal color style, and save time and money while shopping for clothes! Your color card is a cheat sheet wardrobe color guide!
So, you may be asking “What color suits me best?”
There is a whole family of colors that suit you best, not just one! And in seasonal color analysis they fall into color categories by season.
Here’s a quick and simplified overview:
Winter types look best in cool, deep, and clear colors
Spring types look best in warm, light, and clear colors
Summer types look best in cool, light, and muted colors
Autumn types look best in warm, deep, and muted colors
Because we find these 4 categories way too general, we actually break down those types further. Each season has 3 subtypes, so we have 12 types total. Here are our types:
The biggest mistake we see other color analysts making is that they base their color analysis on skin tone only. While skin tone is certainly a very important factor, a quality color analysis should take into account hair, skin, and eye color. For example, you could have a winter skin tone, but spring eyes, and summer hair! We’ve seen it! This is when a professional color analyst can determine which season will look best on you.
So what is the best color analysis system?
No matter which system you choose for your color analysis, you should look for a few important things:
#1 – Is the analysis based on hair, skin, and eye color?
All 3 need to be taken into consideration to properly identify your color style!
#2 – How many colors do they give you?
It’s pretty difficult to build a wardrobe around just a handful of colors. Look for systems that give you at least 25 best shades, ideally more. At the Color Guru, we found that 35 is the perfect amount. That’s why we created our color cards to look like this, with your best 35 shades!
#3 – Do they offer makeup and hair help as well?
You’ll likely feel like knowing your best clothing colors is a total gamechanger, but you may want to upgrade your makeup and hair color to coordinate with your season. It’s wonderful to have that help available if you want it!
We give makeup cards that look like this:
Here are some of the most common questions we hear…
Will my colors change as I age?
Will my colors change if my hair goes grey?
What colors look good on tan skin?
What colors look best on pale skin?
Can you really tell me my best colors with a virtual color analysis?
Is your system based on season color theory?
What does it mean when a color washes you out?

To which I answer “YES!” For some people, wearing whatever they want means throwing out any and all “rules” anyone else prescribes for them. I honor that. However, after working with hundreds of women, I know that the “no rules” approach often leads to boatloads of confusion. ??
Before I began studying color analysis, I was confused too. I bought lots of stuff, but it didn’t work on me or work together! I disliked shopping and just thought “I guess I just don’t have any sense of style.” Well, that wasn’t true. ? ? ? ? ? ?
What I didn’t have was good guidance. Why do celebrities look so put together? Because they’ve paid a stylist, who has tons of practice and expertise to guide them. Great personal style takes good guidance and practice, that’s all. And once you know the rules, you can intentionally and thoughtfully choose to break them, like I did in this photo. ? ?
I’m a Calm Autumn and the blue of this dress is not on my color card. I wear deep, muted, and warm colors best. Well, this dress is deep and muted, but it isn’t warm. However, it is peppered with warm colors. But you know what the most important thing was? I just instantly fell in love with it! And I knew that, for me, it was a great purchase because there are many things that work about it, and I love it. ? ?

355,https://yourcolorguru.com/why-seasonal-color-analysis-is-making-a-comeback/,"Seasonal color analysis is back big time! And here’s why.
If you’re in your 50’s, 60’s or 70’s, you’ve likely heard of seasonal color analysis and maybe have had a color consultation. If you’re in your 30’s or 40’s, ask your mom or grandmother if they remember “getting their colors done”? And many who are under 30, you may be hearing about season colors for the first time ever just lately.
What is Color Analysis?
Color Analysis is the process of analyzing a person’s hair, skin, and eye color to match them with the color palette that will be most flattering to them. Having a personal color test done can inform your clothing choices for the rest of your life!
For example, if you have fair skin with pink undertones, cool blonde hair, and grey/blue eyes, you’ll likely look best in one of the Soft Summer colors palettes. The Sunlit Summer Seasonal Color Palette is full of beautiful cool pastels (like Cotton Candy blue, Sea Glass green, and Baby Pink) and wonderful neutrals (like charcoal grey, true white, and navy blue)
But someone with quite different coloring – black hair, deep brown skin, and brown eyes will have a much deeper, darker color palette, like a Twilight Winter, which is full of jewel tones (like ruby red, sapphire blue, and emerald green) and high-contrast neutrals (like crisp white and black).
Why did Seasonal Color Analysis Fall Out of Trend?
Seasonal color analysis was first popularized in the 1980’s with the brand Color Me Beautiful, and rapidly became massively popular. It’s not surprising that it was so well received. Getting your colors done is so incredibly helpful for:
- looking your best,
- shopping for clothes more easily, and
- creating a coordinated wardrobe.
As a color analyst, I’m still amazed that color analysis ever fell out of trend! However, I suspect it was due to the fact that the system was too simple. People recognized that the 4 Seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn) classifications are simply not enough to analyze the wide variety of unique skin tones, hair, and eye color combinations that exist in our world.
I’ve also worked with people to simplify their closets for over 10 years now as a professional color consultant, and I hear the same things over and over. People are sick of their overstuffed closets and drawers. They realize that buying disposable clothing is not good for their lifestyle, wallet, or the environment. More people are wanting to carefully choose what they wear, and they want that clothing to last. Seasonal color analysis can help them make the best choice the first time.
Is it the same as the ‘80s trend?
Color analysis has come a long way from the 80’s, when there were just 4 seasons – Winter, Spring, Summer, and Autumn. We saw that wasn’t nearly specific enough for all the variation we see in people’s unique coloring, so we created a 12 season system. Each Season has 3 sub-types based on their dominant coloring quality. For example, a Sunlit Summer is the lightest of the 3 Summer types. Their dominant quality if LIGHT.
Which Season are You?
Well, here’s how it works in our system. We’ve made our goal to provide the most comprehensive virtual color analysis available on the internet! You submit several photos (we require a minimum of 7) and answer a questionnaire. We then do a general color analysis on your photos. We then do a more specific color analysis. So for example, if in the general analysis, you are a Winter type, we then do a much more specific Winter seasonal color analysis on your photos. This is where we determine your dominant quality as compared to other Winter types. We’ve created an in-depth form of personal color analysis, done virtually so that you can easily discover your best colors.",colorguru
