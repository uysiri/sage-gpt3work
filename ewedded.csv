https://www.ewedded.com/blogs/behind-the-seams/4-tips-for-how-to-choose-a-veil-for-your-wedding-dress,"In my nearly two decades of styling brides I found that when it comes to the veil the first question for many of them was to veil or not to veil? For some it came down to breaking away from an ancient tradition they felt no longer resonated with modern times and for others it was simply that they were overwhelmed by the many wedding veil styles there are to choose from and/or were not sure exactly how to wear a veil.
Choosing a long veil or short veil, embellished or simple, blusher or no blusher, or to even wear one at all is ultimately the decision you have to make, but here are some things to consider as you’re pondering whether to incorporate a veil into your aisle style.
Keep an Open Mind
You probably were given this same advice when you were shopping for your wedding gown. It also rings true for the veil because once you put one on it completely transforms your entire wedding day look. What I like most about veils (other than tradition) is how they delicately frame the face and gown silhouette (when wearing a long veil). So, when your stylist asks if she can put a veil on you after you’ve chosen your dream gown, I suggest saying yes. In the end, you may not end up choosing to wear a veil, but at least you can say you gave it a consideration.
Consider your Hairstyle
How to pick a veil for your hairstyle can be tricky, and it’s all about where you want to incorporate the veil into your mane - top of head, center back or low. If you plan on wearing your hair down with loose casual curls, maybe you forgo a veil, or wear a simple one layer or circular cut chapel or cathedral length veil that will sit atop your crown with ease. For low pulled back hairstyles you may want to secure the veil at the base of your head. However, if you plan on wearing a blusher then it should sit higher up on your head.
Indoor or Outdoor Ceremony
Let me preface this by reminding you that this post consists of suggestions not rules - so please take the parts you think you can benefit from and leave the rest behind. In the process of asking yourself, “what type of veil should I wear?”, also consider how much you’re willing to fuss with it. If you’re getting married outside, there’s a chance that the weather may not cooperate, and since most wedding veils material are of weightless tulle it may be blowing right in your face. With this said, while you may have to bag the veil for exchanging “I do’s”, you can still use it for epic photo ops.
For indoor ceremonies know how long the aisle is your working with and how formal of a setting it is. If you’re getting married in a cathedral with an aisle the length of a football field then a cathedral length veil may be the perfect accessory to complete your look. If your ceremony is in a family home or estate with no aisle then perhaps you choose an elbow length or even a birdcage veil with your dress.
Let Your Gown Do the Choosing
I’m going to let you in on a little secret: any wedding gown can benefit from a veil! If you’re worried that a long sleeve wedding dress with veil or a tea length wedding dress with veil is too much or won’t look right, there’s no need to fret. The key is making sure that from the many different types of veils there are to choose from that you’ve chosen a one that enhances as opposed to overpowers your wedding day beauty.
When pondering wedding veil ideas the best advice I can give you about picking the perfect one is to make sure you create balance and harmony:
With gowns of understated detail consider an edged veil in crystals, ribbon or lace. Perhaps it’s choosing a veil that adds dimension in terms of the cut or embellishments. You can really go as dramatic or simple as you choose.
If you’re wearing a heavily beaded or all over lace gown you can either level up the grandeur with a crystal encrusted veil or lace mantilla or choose a minimal style that frames you and your gown to perfection.
For vintage and short dresses add some whimsy with either a birdcage veil or a voluminous short wedding veil that brushes your shoulders or elbows.
Now that I’ve got you obsessing over whether to veil or not to veil, I want to leave you with a wedding veil length guide to help make the process as easy as possible!"
https://www.ewedded.com/blogs/behind-the-seams/5-tips-for-managing-wedding-day-disasters-with-ease,"6 Tips for Managing Wedding Day Disasters with Ease
Planning a wedding is a huge undertaking and not always rainbows and butterflies. Even if you have the most organized plan, you may face crises. Potential wedding day mishaps can range from small issues like a missing bridesmaid’s bouquet to larger issues like a storm threatening to ruin the reception. No matter what the issue, it’s important to know how to manage wedding day crises.
Here are some tips to help you manage wedding day crises:
Hire a Wedding Day Coordinator: Not every marrying couple desires to or has a budget for a full-service wedding planner, but wedding day coordinators can offer enormous value when it comes to deflecting wedding disasters and ensure that you and your fiancé get to enjoy the biggest day of your lives. If a day-of wedding coordinator isn't in your budget, refer to tip #5.
Stay Calm: The most important thing to do when faced with a wedding disaster is to stay calm. Take a few deep breaths, step away from the situation, and think about the best way to handle the issue. By staying calm and focused, you’ll be better able to assess the problem and come up with a solution.
Have a Plan B: Before the wedding day, think about potential issues that may arise and have a plan B ready. This could be a backup venue in case of bad weather, extra decorations in case something breaks, or extra seating in case more guests arrive than expected. Having a plan B ready will help you quickly and effectively manage any wedding day crises.
Communicate: If wedding mishaps occurs, make sure to communicate with all the necessary people. This might include your vendors, the venue staff, family, and the wedding party. Keeping everyone informed will help the situation stay under control and you’ll be able to effectively work together to come up with a solution.
Delegate Tasks: You don’t have to do everything yourself. If a day-of wedding coordinator isn't part of your plan, delegate a loved one or member of your bridal party to be the problem solver. Giving this responsibility to someone else will also help to make sure that all other necessary tasks are still getting done while you’re dealing with the crisis.
Pack a Wedding Emergency Kit: Should you or someone in your bridal party be faced with a wedding day wardrobe malfunction or are in need of basic essentials, you want to make sure you have an emergency kit to handle these issues. Your day-of coordinator should have this in their arsenal of management tools, but here's a list of some vital items to have in your kit if you're going to DIY one:
Double-sided tape
Super glue
Sewing kit
Tide stick
Q-tips
Baby or makeup wipes
Large safety pins
Bobby pins
Hairspray
Feminine products
Hairspray
Zip-ease or a white crayon
Remember these tips to help you manage any potential wedding day crises and make sure that you enjoy your big day."
https://www.ewedded.com/blogs/behind-the-seams/5-tips-to-ensure-perfect-wedding-gown-alterations,"5 Essential Tips for Perfect Wedding Gown Alterations
Navigating the wedding gown alterations process can be daunting, stressful ,and emotional for many brides. My belief is these feelings stem from a lack of understanding of the process, being ill-prepared, and for most brides the alterations process is so close to their wedding day, so the anxieties and stress are at an all-time wedding planning high.
The following FAQ's & tips should melt your stress away, bring a beaming smile to your face and ensure your gown fits your every line and curve to perfection.
When Should I Get My Wedding Dress Altered?
Once you have possession of your gown, call the store you purchased it from (if they offer in-house alterations). Or if you purchased it online or somewhere else, find a skilled and reputable wedding seamstress and schedule your fittings. I highly recommend doing this no matter how far away your wedding date is. If the seamstress doesn't schedule wedding dress fittings as far out as I’ve recommended, ask them when you should schedule your first appointment.
Make sure the tailor knows all the details about the work that needs to be executed on your gown, particularly if there will be custom work or accent pieces that need to be crafted, such as sleeves or sashes or boleros. I can’t stress the importance of this, especially if you can only find time for alteration appointments on the weekends. The amount of work and complexity of the tailoring you want and need on your gown will determine your wedding dress fitting timeline. On standard alterations most seamstresses require at least eight weeks prior to your wedding for your first fitting, but it's always better to give them more time if you can.
How Much Can You Alter a Wedding Dress?
Most seamstresses have a two-size limit for taking in a gown without compromising its natural look and fit. Anything greater than this is considered a reconstruction and you can expect more dollar signs if a tailor has to reconstruct the gown to fit you. I would keep this in mind if you're on a weight loss plan. Don’t lose so much weight that your gown has to be remade to suit your new size.
You can’t wait for all that weight you plan on losing to come off before you schedule your first appointment either. What if you don’t lose it? Worst case scenario, what if you gain weight? I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it happens to some brides. Stress takes hold of our bodies in ways we have zero control over. Weight gain could be a result of the added stress you’re lugging around.
So, can a wedding dress be let out? If you purchase a gown that's too small or you gained weight since you purchased your gown there are ways of getting a dress altered down, but it may be costly, and you need to ensure you've enlisted a highly skilled seamstress to do the work. In most cases you won't have to go purchase a whole new gown, but it's on you to find a seamstress who has years of experience working with brides and know how to masterfully alter a wedding dress.
What Do Wedding Gown Alterations Cost?
I wish there was an easy answer for this, but how much you pay for alterations depends on a number of factors including gown fabrication and intricacies, desired custom work, your body proportions and the amount of turnaround time you've given the seamstress to do the work.
For example, if you buy a gown with a lace hem, the seamstress will most likely need to hand-pick the lace from the hem to tailor it to your length (unless the designer sent the gown with the hem unattached, which is an option that more and more designers are offering). It can take days for a seamstress to get this done. Seamstresses need to be precise in every change they make to your gown, which is why a generous time frame is essential. If you are wearing a gown with no hem detail, you will pay much less for your hem than a bride who has a lace gown that needs hemming.
To be safe I recommend allotting $350-$450 for your gown alterations. If you know what tailor you're going to be using in advance of purchasing your gown, you may want to ask for their wedding gown alterations price list to better gauge your costs. If you don't know who you're going to use, ask former brides and your network for recommendations on places that alter wedding dresses. Nothing beats a first-hand recommendation.
Altering a wedding gown is intensely laborious. It’s not in any way, shape, or form similar to modifying one of your work dresses or a pair of jeans. The skill required to correctly alter a wedding gown is one very few people possess; it shouldn’t be overlooked or undervalued by you or the person paying for the alterations to your gown. Go into the process knowing they're expensive and worth every penny!
How Long Do Wedding Gown Alterations Take?
You should expect a minimum of two fittings. Some brides require three and others even more. Your first fitting will most likely be the longest. The seamstress will pin you for the majority, if not all, of the required alterations. You will discuss any changes, custom work, or additions at this time. Your second fitting is to evaluate the fit of the gown and give you instructions on how to bustle your train. If any minor adjustments need to be made, a third fitting will be necessary. If there are more than three, this is usually because there are specifics greater than standard alterations involved, or perhaps a communication problem between you and the seamstress resulting in you not being completely happy with your gown. Seamstresses need to be precise in every change they make to your gown, which is why a generous time frame is essential.
If at any stage of your alterations process, you’re not happy with something, don’t stay quiet. Unless you communicate what’s bothering you, the seamstress is not going to see it. She doesn’t have a crystal ball. If you tell her what you don’t like and she either won’t or can’t fix her work, ask to speak with a manager or the owner. If the seamstress is the owner, I suggest you ask her to put your gown in your garment bag and give it to you to take somewhere else. Don’t allow her to do any further work on it.
What Do I Need to Bring With Me to My Wedding Dress Alterations?
It's extremely important to bring the following items to all your fitting appointments:
The shoes you will walk down the aisle in
Bra or bra cups you plan on wearing with your gown
Undergarments like slips and petticoats
For custom work you may need fabric, sketches, and measurements
Patience, courteousness, and a smile
At your final fitting you may want to bring your veil, headpiece, and any other accessories you plan on wearing so you can pull all the elements of your aisle style together.
In closing, you have to own your gown process. Be responsible, respectful, and accountable—just as you expect from everyone you’ve enlisted to make magic happen for you. Alterations are a process, and it can be a long one, but the fit of your gown will be the driving factor of how comfortable and beautiful you feel on your wedding day."
https://www.ewedded.com/blogs/behind-the-seams/6-tips-to-kickstart-your-destination-wedding-planning,"6 Tips to Kickstart Your Destination Wedding Planning
There's a slew of benefits to planning a destination wedding, like hosting fewer guests, checking off a bucket list destination or going back to a place that holds special meaning to you and your fiance. Plus, you get a ""twofer"" wedding and honeymoon all in one.
However, planning from afar has its own logistical intricacies and you have to put a lot of faith in professionals you don't have immediate (and local) access to. Without the proper planning and guidance the nuances of a destination wedding can be complex and stressful . We've outlined some tips and planning considerations to curb any anxieties and pitfalls.
First, let's define what is a destination wedding? According the The Knot, a destination wedding is a wedding that takes place outside of the city or town that the soon-to-be-married couple currently lives in! So whether you're planning a romantic simple beach wedding a few towns away or an exotic wedding overseas, both are considered destination affairs.
If this sounds appealing to you keep reading for some practical recommendations.
Visit your ideal destination before committing to it. If your schedule and budget allow it you will have more peace of mind and clarity of your wedding day vision if you can visit your location in advance, especially if it's a plane ride away.
Once you decide on your location create your destination wedding checklist. This will help you stay on track and budget and will guide you in delegating responsibility to your planning team.
Send save-the-date cards ASAP. Give your loved ones plenty of time to rearrange their schedules and save up for your wedding. The addition of a wedding website with important information about your destination will be a huge help to your guests and minimize texts, calls and emails from everyone.
Hire local professionals who know the wedding landscape and requirements of where you're getting married. This may include a destination wedding planner, photographer and entertainment. They have the scoop and connections to make your wedding unforgettable (for all the right reasons).
Indulge in the details and guest experience. Hosting a destination wedding may require your guests to be present for multiple days and if your location is far away traveling can be a hefty financial investment. An unforgettable all around experience may include welcome baskets of treats specific to the region, festive pre-wedding activities, and relaxing or intimate day-after-wedding events.
Ship ahead & arrive early. If you're planning on shipping decor or other items make sure you give yourself plenty of time (2-3 weeks) in case of damage or lost packages. If you can arrive 1-2 days early to do a walk through with your planning team you'll be able to decompress and relax before all the whirlwind of wedding fun kicks off.

https://www.ewedded.com/blogs/behind-the-seams/9-tips-for-keeping-your-inner-bridezilla-at-bay,"This post is for every bride, no matter what stage of the wedding planning you’re in. Maybe you just got engaged, or you could be at the pinnacle of stress and feel that inner Bridezilla rearing her head, or maybe you’ve become a full-fledged Bridezilla. The good news is it’s never too late to extinguish your inner Bridezilla.
It’s easy to get blindsided by our zilla tendencies!
I’m sure your heart is thumping with anticipation to realize your wedding dreams as you float down the aisle in a magnificently pristine white, ivory, champagne, blush, silver, or any-other-color-of-the-rainbow wedding gown you’ve chosen to adorn you as you exchange vows with your true love.
So how does one go from ‘getting a ring on it’ to floating down the aisle without becoming a Bridezilla? The first step is trying to understand why a bride-to-be has the potential to turn into a raging lunatic.
I have a theory and it starts with Cinderella.
As it is for many women, watching Cinderella for the first time as a young girl may have sprouted your very first dreams of becoming a bride. It’s a dream that strengthens in us as we get older and intensifies when we finally find our true love.
And, let’s face it, the most magical part of Cinderella’s transformation from an ordinary girl into the princess of all princesses is not the mystique of the glass slipper or the carriage drawn by white horses, or even Prince Charming; it’s the sparkling blue gown her fairy godmother spins up for her to wear to the ball, the gown that compels our eyes to widen as we gaze at Cinderella catching the attention of every guest and the prince himself. And then there’s her wedding gown . . .
It’s Cinderella’s beauty in her snowy-white classic ball gown that’s engraved on the brains and hearts of young girls, forever, and the one thing we’ll never forget from the movie. An emotional connection to this symbolism of “true-love” garment has been established and is the standard we will follow when it is time for our wedding day.
And, as though Cinderella wasn’t enough to keep us wedding crazed and gown obsessed, as we grow into womanhood, we continue to be bombarded with fairytale wedding images. From magazines to movies, books, the internet, and songs, we’re surrounded by wedding consumerism.
I’d bet many of you bought your first wedding magazine before you were even of marrying age. I’d also speculate that there are women across this country with secret Pinterest boards filled with hundreds of inspiring wedding images yet with no prospect of getting engaged anytime soon. Before you got a ring on it, you may have been one of these women, or you may know a friend or two who fits this bill.
Over the years, weddings have become more elaborate and expensive and more of a production.
We can thank the multitude of wedding shows such as Say Yes to the Dress, Bridezillas, Platinum Weddings, and the over-the-top reality star weddings from the Bachelor and Real Housewives franchises for contributing to the fantasies of modern-day couples who are ready to embark on wedding planning, just as you’re about to do.
If you’re anything like me, you’ve killed a significant number of brain cells watching these shows and fantasizing about every detail you want for your own wedding day.
There are so many more niceties involved in planning a wedding today than there were twenty-five years ago—even ten years ago. With more particulars to attend to, there is a greater level of attention required in order to bring your vision to reality. This increases the stress for everyone involved in your big day, which amplifies the chance that the wedding professionals you choose to work with will fall short of your expectations. I don’t want that for you (or them) so I’m here to help.
For most women, the focal point of her obsession is her wedding gown, and you may be the same. Crafting the perfect frock of your daydreams, tearing dozens of gown photos from magazines, and spending countless hours searching online for your perfect dress engulfs you.
You may be reading this and thinking there’s no way I’ll get so obsessed with planning to risk becoming a bridezilla, but I can assure you, every bride before you thought the very same thing, yet lo and behold, for one reason or another, many of them morphed from everyday woman to bona fide B-R-I-D-E!
I know this because prior to starting EWedded I was the owner and operator of multiple bridal boutiques for over 13 years. As a stylist and gown retailer, I was under constant pressure to deliver a bride the gown of her dreams, in pristine condition and with a supreme fit. It was a wonderful, stressful, beautiful, daunting, emotional, and sometimes painful adventure. I loved it!
From the moment I started my company until the day I closed my doors, I kept a file of customer issues that I often referred to so I could continue to hone my team and my business practices. There were three problem areas that resonated with brides over and over again:
- Her shopping experience
- Delivery of her merchandise
- Problems with the fit of her gown and/or the alterations process
The purchase of your wedding gown and the assurance of its perfection is more than a one-day shopping jaunt. It’s a process that begins the instant you establish communication with a retailer and ends when you’ve completed your final alterations fitting and are gleefully trotting out the door with your gown in hand. The length of time from the day you buy your gown until your wedding day will determine the length of your relationship with your retailer; it can be three months or twenty-four months or somewhere in between.
Taking all of this into consideration here’s my advice to ensure that by the time you’ve said “I do,” your road to wedded bliss has been a Cinderella story.
Carve out plenty of time for shopping, planning and for gown alterations.
Set your budget before you start shopping and planning.
Set and communicate your expectations of your bridal party and your wedding vendors at the very start of your planning process.
Invest in a wedding planner (even if it’s just for day-of-planning) or delegate tasks to the members of your bridal party.
Remove the word perfect from your vocabulary. Things will go wrong. Be ready to roll with the punches.
Take planning pauses and get back to enjoying your future spouse sans the pressure of wedding planning.
Drown out the noise. Everyone is going to have opinions about nearly every aspect of your wedding planning process. Only filter the opinions that matter (the first being you and your fiancé’s).
Don’t get so entrenched in the details (that likely only you will notice) that you stop having fun.
HAVE FUN! SAY “I DO!”"

Weddings are a special event that often come with a hefty price tag. From the venue to the dress, it can be easy to go over budget and end up spending much more than you intended. Planning a wedding doesn’t have to break the bank, however. Here are some tips on how to keep wedding costs down.
Set a budget and stick to it. You should decide how much you are willing to spend on your wedding before you begin planning. Make sure to consider all potential costs, such as vendors, decorations, and food. Once you have a budget, stick to it and try to find ways to cut costs where you can.
Choose a non-traditional venue. Consider venues outside of the traditional wedding locations, such as a friend’s backyard or a local park. These venues may be less expensive than those at more popular wedding locations, such as hotels or banquet halls.
Shop around for vendors. When looking for vendors, such as a photographer or caterer, don’t be afraid to shop around. Compare prices and services to find the best deal. Whether it be securing low cost wedding venues to finding an affordable wedding planner you have to do your research, put in the time, and leverage your circle of influence to ensure your getting the best deal possible without compromising on value.
DIY decorations. Many frugal weddings that look expensive are all because of a commitment to DIY. Get creative and make your own decorations (or enlist your most creative family and friends). You can find plenty of DIY tutorials online that can help you create beautiful decorations for your wedding.
Skip the favors. Wedding favors can be an extra expense that is often unnecessary. If you do decide to give out favors, look for inexpensive items that still make a statement.
Consider a weekday or off-season wedding. The majority of weddings happen on the weekends and in the summer and fall months. If you're open to getting married on a Thursday in December, you can shave quite a bit off of your wedding budget.
Rent when you can. Another relatively easy way to save money is to rent items like jewelry, suits and tuxedos, and decor (even faux and wood flowers).
Create a signature drink. Easily opt out of a top-shelf liquor and multiple bar options by only serving a signature drink or add a couple of beer and wine options for more of a cost-efficient variety.
Plan a quick wedding. Time is money and that is even truer when planning a wedding. The longer the planning time, the easier (and more likely) it is to go over budget. Save yourself time, money and stress by planning a wedding in fewer than six months.
Planning a wedding can be a stressful and expensive process, but it doesn’t have to be. There are plenty of budget wedding ideas and with a little creativity and some careful planning, you can achieve affordable wedding planning and have the day of your dreams at the same time."

One month out you should be finalizing and confirming your wedding day itinerary and timeline, and if you're working with a planner make sure you're confirming the wedding coordinator checklist with your planning team - you want to make sure you're on the same page. This list should also include a confirmed wedding vendor checklist. All of the key players in your wedding day should be lined up at this point.
The other planning priorities at this point include:
Finalize rehearsal dinner details
Song selection and announcements with your band and/or DJ
Provide your photographer with 10-12 of your must-have before and after ceremony posed photos
Confirm when final payments need to be given to your vendors
Enlist a planner or bridal party member to get your last minute guest list RSVP's
Set your reception seating arrangement if you plan on having assigned seats
If you plan on changing your name and address you should start that process at this time
The 2 to 3 weeks before wedding frenzy kicks in you get a bit of a breather, but the 'wedding must have list of items' in this time frame are very important and shouldn't be overlooked.
Pick up your wedding rings
Confirm the arrival times with your vendors
Confirm hotel and and accommodation reservations
Have your final gown fitting if you haven't done so already
Choose the date and schedule obtaining your marriage license and blood tests
The week before your wedding will require your bridal party and anyone else involved in the planning to begin fulfilling their responsibilities too. It's an all-hands-on-deck moment from here on out:
Provide your caterer with your final guest count
Pack for your honeymoon (if you're going right after your wedding)
Schedule pick up times for wedding gown and tuxedos
Groom and his party should have final tux fittings if they're renting
Coordinate tux rental returns
Enlist your bridal party to help with wedding errands and responsibilities
Give gifts to your wedding party, family and your fiance if you don't want to do it at the rehearsal dinner
Make arrangements for someone to collect and take your wedding gifts to your home
Arrange house/pet sitter while you're on your honeymoon
While the couple of days before your wedding should include pampering yourself and relaxing activities, there's still some fine details that need to be taken care of.
Finalize your day of wedding planner checklist
Get your nails done, and if you haven't already done so have a hair and makeup trial run
Compile a contact list of your vendors and important people who will be ""running the show"" and distribute to the appropriate people
Make payment envelopes for your vendors and give them to your planner or coordinator to distribute at the wedding
Make a wedding day emergency kit
Have your ceremony rehearsal and rehearsal dinner
Go to bed early and drink lots of water
On your wedding day you should have very little to do other than to have the time of your life and marry your forever person. All of the duties to orchestrate the wedding of your dreams should have been delegated to the appropriate people. On your big day we recommend the following:
Take time to meditate, relax and reflect
Get your hair and makeup done early so you have plenty of time for pre-wedding photos
Stay nourished and hydrated
Don't forget the wedding rings and marriage license
Exchange ""I do's""
Bask in every moment and have the time of your life"

Eco-Friendly Weddings: With the environment becoming an increasingly important topic, couples are looking for ways to make their weddings more eco-friendly. Ideas include using sustainable materials for decorations, opting for locally sourced food, purchasing decor and attire second-hand and even choosing venues that are powered by renewable energy sources.
Non-Traditional Venues: Traditional wedding venues are becoming less popular. Couples are opting for unique locations such as historic homes, wineries, museums, castles and even private estates.
Digital Invitations: Physical invitations are becoming a thing of the past as couples opt for digital versions. This is not only more convenient for the couple but also more eco-friendly.
Food Trucks: Food trucks have become increasingly popular for weddings, as they allow couples to offer their guests a variety of food options. From gourmet options to traditional dishes, food trucks are sure to be a big hit in 2023.
Bold Colors: 2023 wedding colors are right and bold. From vibrant reds and blues to soft pastels and everything in between. Couples will have a wide array of options when it comes to choosing the perfect color for their big day and direction for the bride on what bridesmaid dress colors to choose.
Minimalist Wedding Gowns: Minimalism has become increasingly popular in wedding dress trends, and is sure to grow in popularity. We can expect to see bridalwear with simple silhouettes, subtle embellishments, and muted colors.
Disco Decor: Disco decor has become increasingly popular among wedding receptions, adding a touch of retro glamour to the festivities. From shimmering disco balls to LED light-up dance floors, disco decor has become a must-have for creating the perfect wedding celebration.
Comfy Reception Decor: Expanding on the popularity of wedding lounges, couples will be making their guests feel right at home with residential inspired furniture like over sized sofas, ornate rugs, lanterns and candles and chandeliers."
https://www.ewedded.com/blogs/behind-the-seams/the-easy-guide-to-green-ideas-for-an-eco-friendly-wedding,"Anyone who's planned a wedding or is currently planning one knows that they're expensive. According to The Knot Real Wedding Study couples spent an average of $34,000 on their wedding in 2021. The hefty price tag of these fête's also create massive amounts of waste.
Did you know the average wedding produces 400 pounds of garbage and 63 tons of carbon dioxide, according to ""The Green Bride Guide,"" by Kate Harrison? A wedding doesn't just have an impact on your wallet, it also has a lasting impact on our environmental preservation.
With more couples seeking to incorporate eco-friendly elements into their wedding and becoming more intentional about sustainability we're laying out an easy guide to planning a green wedding.
Sustainable Wedding Dresses
Since the wedding dress is typically the first big purchase in the planning process we want to provide a few options on how to snag yourself an eco-friendly wedding dress.
Purchase from a sustainable wedding dress brand. These designers use recycled or eco-friendly materials and typically work in small studio spaces that emit fewer carbon emissions. Green Wedding Shoes provides a thorough list of designers to choose from.
Purchase vintage, pre-owned or refashioned wedding looks. This is a time to tap into your creativity. Perhaps you can use family gowns and heirlooms and redesign them to a look that best captures your style.
Shop designer samples. This is where EWedded comes in. We work with independent retailers and brands to sell their discontinued and stagnant inventory. Once you learn what happens to unsold wedding gowns this may be the perfect way for you to help lighten the global carbon footprint by purchasing a sample dress.
Eco Friendly Wedding Invitations
One of the first things to hit the trash are the paper goods used in your wedding design, and that starts with your invitation suite.
One of the easiest ways to be sustainably conscious with your invitations is to go digital and leverage technology. Aside from your formal invitation the rest of your suite could be digital and managed through a wedding website.
Print your invite and other announcements on recycled paper or made of sustainably sourced materials.
Use plantable seed paper for the most eco-friendly wedding invites.
Eco Friendly Wedding Rings
There are a number of ways to ensure sustainable wedding ring choices that are environmentally conscious and even celebrate nature.
If you want to stay with a classic diamond in your engagement ring and band then be sure to purchase either conflict-free or lab-created diamonds.
Consider rings made of recycled or repurposed materials for your sustainable wedding bands.
Frequent estate sales and antique shops to find the perfect vintage bling for your ring finger.
Eco Friendly Wedding Decorations
When it comes to decor your options are endless and the process of picking the right decorations can be an overwhelming process.
One way to make it easy is to choose a venue with built-in decor or an aesthetic that requires few add-ons. Consider an outdoor setting like botanical gardens, a winery, or an elegantly appointed Estate. You may want to think about choosing a date close to a holiday. From Thanksgiving to the New Year you can bet most venues will be decked out in seasonal decor.
Purchase used decorations. Facebook Marketplaces is a great place to start if you're looking to purchased pre-loved items.
Seek out items that can be reused in your home decor like chalk boards, glass signage, lanterns, string lights and chandeliers, and vases.
Conscious Floral Arrangements
Fresh flowers tend to be the most popular option and they're truly eye-catching and transformational, but those freshly cut beauties are not the best eco-friendly wedding flowers if going green is top priority for you.
Choose dried flowers or wild flowers.
Capture the botanical look you want with fabric or wood flowers. Some sites to check out include Sola Wood Flowers and Forbes list of the best places to purchase artificial flowers.
Literally, go green. Instead of flowers achieve your desired style with locally grown greenery, like herbs, succulents, evergreens and other plants that catch your eye.
There are a number of ways to pull off a green wedding. Some other ideas to reduce wedding waste include:
Look for caterers who focus on local, sustainable, and seasonal cuisine.
Donate what you can - food, flowers, decor and more.
Rent when you can. Read our blog on what to rent vs. buy for inspiration.

https://www.ewedded.com/blogs/behind-the-seams/the-ultimate-guide-to-choosing-proposing-to-your-bridesmaids,"When you’re planning a wedding, it can be hard to decide who to ask to be your bridesmaid (or bridesman). After all, you want to honor the people who are most important to you and make sure everyone feels included. Often, due to social pressure or family obligation, a bride feels that she has to have more people in her bridal party than she wants.
Here are some best practices for choosing bridesmaids while maintaining who and how many people you want standing with you at the altar. We've also peppered in some bridesmaid proposal ideas that will make the process as stress-free as possible.
1. Choose People Who You’re Close With
When choosing your bridal party, pick people who have been with you through thick and thin and you know have your best interest at heart. There’s no need to feel obligated to include a distant cousin or a friend-of-a-friend. Pick people who have been there for you in the past, who you can rely on, and who you know will be supportive throughout the wedding planning process.
There are other ways to include the special people in your life without asking them to be part of your bridal party.
-
Invite them to do a reading
-
Ask them to serve as an usher
-
If they sing or play an instrument invite them person to be part of the ceremony
-
Give them the honor of saying the prayer or giving a toast at the reception
2. Consider the Number of Bridesmaids
Your wedding party size should be manageable for you and be a source of inspiration and support rather than additional stress. Consider the number of people you’ll be able to comfortably accommodate at your ceremony site and venue. You should also take into account the budget for bridesmaids’ dresses and accessories. Being a bridesmaid is an in investment of time and money, so these should be factored into your final decision.
3. Be Mindful of Emotions & Expectations
When asking someone to be part of your bridal party, be mindful of their emotions. It can be difficult for someone to say no to such an important request, so make sure you’re sensitive to their feelings. Also, if you’re asking someone you haven’t spoken to in a while, make sure to catch up with them and explain why you’re asking them to be a bridesmaid.
The responsibilities of a bridesmaid are typically set by the bride. Your bridal party is your responsibility. You need to manage the group with open and honest dialogue about what you expect from them in terms of time commitments, special dates and financial contributions at the onset of your wedding planning.
4. Make It Special
When asking someone to be your bridesmaid, make it special. Try to find a unique and personal way to propose. Here are a few ideas for a unique bridesmaid proposal:
-
Organize a fun day out with all of your bridesmaids-to-be, like a day at the spa or even throw a bridesmaids’ party, that's all about them. Since most of the planning process will be about you, this gesture puts your maids in the spotlight for a moment.
-
Bridesmaid proposal box ideas are always a huge hit. If you're unsure of what to put in a bridesmaid proposal box, rely on these popular trends - candles, beauty and wellness items, personalized tumblers, robes, jewelry, wine and sweets. To level the proposal box up take the time to include a sentimental bridesmaid proposal letter that's personal and unique to each of your bridesmaids.
-
Host a brunch or dinner and bring out a cake that reads ""Will you be my bridesmaid?""
-
Keep is simple yet thoughtful by mailing a handwritten bridesmaid proposal card.
-
Have flowers, food or balloons sent to each bridesmaid with a personalized proposal attached."
https://www.ewedded.com/blogs/behind-the-seams/to-rent-vs-buy-wedding-essentials,"Planning your wedding will be one of the most exciting and memorable moments in your life, but ask any couple who’s tied the knot before you about their wedding planning experience and you’re sure to hear how overwhelming it can be.
Whether you plan on DIY-ing most of your wedding or offloading all of the work to a planning and design team, there are so many details and necessities that go into pulling off a Pinterest-worthy wedding.
As you’re determining the budget it will be worth doing a cost-comparison on buying versus renting certain items, from wedding aisle decor to your overall reception design.
There are some factors that may sway your rent vs. buy decision, so use our suggestions below as a loose guide to your wedding rental checklist. You’ll want to take into consideration your venue choice, your desire and ability to reuse or pass down a memento or heirloom piece, and your total wedding budget and how you plan on allocating it over all your wedding day essentials.
Attire & Accessories
For the most part it’s easier and less stressful to purchase your wedding day attire and accessories. This is also the case for bridal party dresses. However, for the members of your party that will be wearing a tuxedo or suit, renting seems to be the popular choice.
We don’t recommend renting wedding accessories. As you’re accessorizing, think about how you might be able to wear items from your wedding again like your jewelry and shoes and those stylish details that may be worth preserving or passing down like your veil and headpiece or tie, pocket square and cufflinks. There’s bound to be future special occasions where you may want to break out and wear these mementos again.
Wedding Ceremony Rentals
If you’re getting married in a church or other inside venue there may not be much you have to rent if anything at all, but if your dream is to be married outside here’s a list of the things you may need/want to rent plus some wedding ceremony decor ideas:
Transportation for you and your bridal party
Seating for your guests (and/or lounge furniture)
Aisle runner and/or rugs
Wedding arch or another altar-inspired focal point
Tent(s)
Electricity and lighting (including chandeliers)
Restrooms (for remote venues and tented affairs)
Anything you plan on personalizing like signage and paper goods should be purchased as well as florals, greenery and trees. Think about what might be able to be planted in your yard or garden.
Items that could go either way include candle holders, lanterns, vases and other decor specific to your wedding design. You may want to create a wedding decoration wishlist and determine which items are better for you to purchase rather than rent.
Wedding Reception Rentals
The core of your rentals (especially if you’re having an outdoor wedding) will go towards your reception design. It’s important to find out from your venue what’s included in your price from the list of items below. Your venue may include all inclusive chair, table and linen rentals in your package or offer a la carte wedding decoration package prices, but you need to know exactly what’s included before you write that check.
We suggest the following rental items for your wedding reception be added to your checklist:
Tents
Tables and Chairs
Dance floor
Linens and napkins
Glassware, dinnerware and flatware
Electricity and lighting (including chandeliers)
Restrooms (for remote venues and tented affairs)
Lounge furniture
Bars
Wedding Decor’ Rental Tips
As you determine your needs and wants this post should provide some insight to how to best navigate your purchasing and wedding rental solutions. Do some early research on how much it costs to rent tables and chairs for your wedding or to hire wedding decorators.
Once you know what is going to be rented it will be in your best interest to meet with two to three rental companies to determine if they have what you’re looking for and can work within your budget. Lastly, ask to see past work and make sure to read customer reviews."
