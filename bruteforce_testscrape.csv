https://www.bruteforcetraining.com/blogs/bf/10-reasons-why-sandbag-training-is-awesome-by-matt-palfrey,"1. It’s Affordable & Accessible
I started sandbag training because I didn’t have the time or the money to get to the gym or purchase any other equipment. My first sandbag was a 25kg plastic contractor bag of builders sand, taped up to seal the holes. Was it perfect? No. Did it get me off my ass and doing something? Most definitely. It also cost me less than $3. As I progressed I started adding these bags into ‘outer’ bags for extra strength and durability - I used an old hold-all and rucksack that I had spare in the house. This degree of affordability and accessibility is important as no one should feel like fitness is something unavailable to them.
2. You Can Do It Anywhere
Sandbag training doesn’t really require any additional equipment or specific location. Sure, there are plenty of additional pieces of equipment that will improve your results over time, but you don’t need any of that stuff to get started. It’s also an incredibly portable way to train. I take my sandbag with me when I’m traveling and fill it when I arrive.
3. Be Awesome Rather Than Just Looking Awesome
The bottom line is the vast majority of people who train with sandbags are more concerned with what they can do than how they look. If you walk into a gym with a pile of sandbags in it, you know those people are there to train. Only those in the know will really be able to appreciate that you’re doing superhuman work picking up that nondescript bag. That’s the polar opposite of the guy who picks up the biggest dumbbells and always looks around to make sure people have seen him. It takes real skill to control a sandbag while making the movement look impressive and you’ll probably spend most of your time looking like you’re wrestling an oiled hippopotamus. This is not a good look for posers.
4. It Makes You Feel Like Rocky
I train in my garage in all weather. Plenty of times I have to take a breather because my hands re too cold to grip my already frozen sandbag. Have you ever tried to lift a 90kg frozen sandbag? It’s the kind of thing that makes you pretty focused. I actually like the adversity element that comes with sandbag training. I’m there to get results, to make a real difference and, sometimes, to simply get through it. I don’t care that the other guy is training in a temperature-controlled gym, sipping his energy drink, with access to a whole range of expensive equipment. That guy is Ivan Drago. I’m Rocky Balboa, and I’m going to go the distance (possibly winning the hearts of the Russian people in the process).
5. It Really Does Compliment Other Training Methods
As opposed to a lot of health and fitness ‘experts’ promoting their systems, I’ll just say that sandbag training could be a great addition to your program rather than saying you should drop all that other stuff and do this instead (“no credit card required!”). Yes, you could use sandbag training as your primary form of strength work. I do and it works well for me. But you can also use sandbag training as accessory work for barbell, dumbbell, kettlebell, bodyweight, or any other form of training. Try including some sandbag lifts during deload weeks or during outdoor conditioning sessions like hill sprints. I know plenty of people who have dramatically increased their overhead lifts by supplementing regular barbell presses with sandbag variations, myself included.
6. Unlock A Whole New Range Of Exercises
The nature of the sandbag means you can use it for a range of exercises that are either impractical, or just plain impossible, with other traditional free weights. Sandbag training really comes into its own when you start including exercises like:
- Bear hug squats, step ups, lunges and carries
- Shouldering
- Drags
- Load carries of any variety
7. It’s Unforgiving
The sandbag has a constantly moving center of mass and, more often than not, will make you fight for each and every lift. This does a few interesting things, most notably it gives you a high return on the time and effort you put in. But I’ll be honest right now and tell you a lot of people don’t stick with sandbag training because it isn’t easy and there are very few glossy ads telling you it’s the thing to do. However, like most unconventional training methods it can also yield unconventional results. And sometimes unconventional results are just what you need to move forward.
8. It’s Like Totally Multi-Planar Dude!
While I love biomechanics and sport science, there is no denying it’s often used incorrectly to get you to A) buy something or B) follow a particular method. When discussing multi-planar movement it’s all too common for people to assume that every exercise needs to be performed in every direction for it to be effective. This is just plain nonsense and leads to the kind of programs that steadfastly refuse to incorporate exercises that haven’t literally just been invented there and then. Yes, multi-planar movement is important, but it’s not the be all and end all of athletic training.
Resistance against stress is a great way to work on developing your core strength and multi-planar capabilities. For most people, the ability to resist against movement in the sagittal (forwards and backwards), frontal (side to side) and transverse (rotational) planes is just as important as being able to move through them. The sandbag is a great tool for this as it forces you to control an unstable object through all planes, irrespective of whether you are moving in a particular direction.
9. It Makes You Better At Other Stuff
I’m a big fan of heavy barbell lifting (heavy anything for that matter). And I’ve had numerous conversations with people who are trying to improve their strength that typically raise concerns about their inability to lift as much weight in a sandbag as on a barbell. That’s true, especially when it comes to overhead lifts. But the thing about sandbag training is that it makes you very good at the stuff in between the lifts as well. You get good at the transitions.
You can’t overhead press a sandbag unless you can also clean it up to chest height. If you’re using a handleless sandbag (the choice of the purist) then you’ll also probably have to round back lift it from the floor like an Atlas stone. You may well be pretty tired before you even start your actual exercise and that will really test your mental fortitude. The same is true of many sandbag exercises - there are transitions to accomplish alongside the main lifts. Some would see this as detracting from the program, but I see the opposite. Sure, I like to lift max weight on a barbell from time to time. My sandbag work is something different though. Though I’m loath to say it, as it is always horribly over-used, sandbag training can therefore have a good transference into functional daily activities.
And that leads us nicely onto...
10. Sandbag Training Is Simple (But Not Stupid)
One of the greatest advantages of sandbag training is the intense challenge it can provide. I know I’ll certainly end up dumping the bag after a failed lift far more than I would with a barbell. This has the surprising effect of keeping sessions focused on the work at hand rather than lots of arbitrary additions that don’t really add anything.
One of my favorite sandbag training sessions is 20 ground-to-overhead lifts with a handleless sandbag filled to my bodyweight. It looks simple, even basic, but it never fails to leave me feeling as though I’ve had a great workout. This ethos of straightforward and effective training sums up sandbag training and how I feel about health and fitness as a whole.
Get Yourself A Sandbag
The alternative is to get a sandbag specifically constructed for use as a strength and conditioning tool. On the whole these will be considerably more durable and they will often have additional features such as handles.

Have you ever had to move a load of rocks during a weekend landscaping project? Or had to cut some low hanging or diseased branches off that tree in the front yard? What you might notice as you complete these tasks is that they require a mixture of strength, balance and precise coordination. These skills can be learned and practiced within a solid functional strength training regimen.
The days of going into a gym and lifting barbells and dumbbells for hours on end are over. The trend in fitness is to take what you do in the gym and apply it to your life. This is how Crossfit and other ""movements"" were born. The revolution that has been taking place over the past several years is to make workouts directly adaptable to life. Most of the population isn't working out to compete in a bodybuilding or strength contest, but rather needs the strength and endurance to weather ordinary life trials. Of course bodybuilding and intense weight training will always have a place, but functional training allows real world training to take place every time you train.
One area of functional training that is easy to dive right into is sandbag training. The idea is to lift a sandbag with as much weight as you can manage and eventually form will follow function. In other words, as your strength increases with the sandbag movements, that same strength will carry over into other aspects of your life. Part of the advantage of training with a sandbag is that it offers an ever changing and shifting workload. The shifting sand forces your body to adapt to the weight in real time, just like you do in your everyday life. Think about the last time you helped someone move to another house or apartment. Think about carrying that couch up or down a flight of stairs and think about how you had to change grips or re-position your body to carry the couch over a railing. You can help prepare your body and muscles for all those awkward movements in part with a solid sandbag training routine. That shifting weight inside the sandbag challenges not only your muscles, but your mind as you think about how to control and stabilize that bag of sand.
The idea behind any functional training regimen is to prepare and protect your body for all the challenges you come across in everyday life. Of course if you already have a solid weight lifting routine, sandbag training can be added to fill in any gaps and also for the pure challenge it offers. Sandbags are a perfect entry point into a functional training regimen and also a great addition to almost any training program.
If you're looking for a quality sandbag that will withstand whatever you can dish out visit Brute Force Training has it.

https://www.bruteforcetraining.com/blogs/bf/5-basic-fitness-movements-using-a-brute-force-sandbag,"Fitness sandbags are versatile training tools you can use to build strength and improve overall fitness. The shifting nature of sand provides a unique workout that engages core and stabilizer muscles unlike traditional weight. In spite of its unwieldiness, the sandbag is a highly useful and effective tool to improve your overall strength and conditioning.
Who would benefit from fitness sandbags?
The fitness sandbags are particularly beneficial to athletes who are looking to improve power, strength, and speed for performance in whatever sport they prefer. For beginners, it is important to focus on form and keep things slow at first in order to effectively learn the movements.
Beginners usually start their fitness regimes with some basic sandbag exercises for about 20 – 30 minutes per session. We would advise you to start any workout regime with a warm-up, like jogging or jumping rope for 5-10 minutes. After the warmup, choose a sandbag weight which will feel comfortable enough to lift relatively easily during your fitness sandbag workout.
Here are 5 basic movements any beginner can use to get started with sandbag workouts:
Sandbag Back Squat
The sandbag can be placed across your shoulders behind your head while standing. Lower your body to a squatting posture, keeping the chest high and extending your hips backward. You should keep your weight on your heels. Your knees should not move forward of your toes at any point. Then, drive your hips forward and explode upward, returning to the original position.
Sandbag High Pull
Start with the sandbag on the ground with your body in the deadlift position. Grab the barbell handles and thrust your hips forward while standing up. Meanwhile, leading with the elbows and keeping the sandbag close to your body, pull the sandbag to chest level. Slowly lower the bag back to starting position for one complete rep.
Sandbag Overhead Press
Here, start with the sandbag resting on your arms at the chest level, and then extend the sandbag above your head. Your back should be kept rigidly straight and abdominal muscles need to be kept tight during the performance of this exercise. The shoulder muscles should be fully extended to lift the sandbag above your head and the elbows also should be straightened in the process, finishing the rep with elbows next to your ears. Then the sandbag is lowered back to the chest level and the exercise is repeated.
Fitness Sandbags Lunge
Start with the sandbag across your shoulders or in the overhead position. Step one leg forward while simultaneously lowering the opposite knee to the ground. Then stand up using the forward leg until you are fully upright. Keep your back straight and chest up and then repeat with the opposite leg. Lunges are an excellent way to isolate the larger leg muscles such as quads, glutes and hamstrings.
Start this exercise with the sandbag on the floor and feet shoulder width, hips back, knees over toes with a straight back and upright chest. With a firm grip on the barbell handles, extend your hips forward, and stand up while keeping your arms straight. When fully upright, your sandbag should hang just below your waist against your quads. Then, in a controlled manner, lower the sandbag to the floor to complete one rep.
The unique 8-handle configuration of Brute Force sandbags allows you to perform over 300 movements with this single piece of equipment. Available in 3 sizes to match any fitness or ability level, our sandbags are the best selling and most used in the industry. If you are newer to fitness, we recommend our Mini sandbag, adjustable up to 30 lbs."
https://www.bruteforcetraining.com/blogs/bf/5-best-sandbag-workout-movements-to-build-strength,"Sandbags have become popular in the functional fitness as an alternative to traditional steel weights. Not only are they portable, versatile and adjustable, but they also engages muscle groups differently than traditional barbells or dumbbells. Engaging these key stabilizer muscle groups not only gives a better total body workout, but also enhances neuromuscular coordination.
Power Clean:
The best exercise that engages nearly all muscle groups, the power clean is the powerhouse of the sandbag exercises. Good technique is key to avoiding injury, so make sure you never sacrifice form for repetitions. Starting with the sandbag on the floor in the deadlift position. As you pull the sandbag up your legs toward your waist, drive your hips up and forward in an explosive movement. Catch the sandbag in the front rack position. Cleans engage leg muscles such as quads and hamstrings at the beginning of the movement, but end up attacking traps, lats and arms as the rep is completed. Remember that neuromuscular coordination? This one tops the list for enhanced cognitive function while building strength.
Thruster:
The thruster is a full body movement using almost every muscle group, all while giving you a great cardiovascular workout. Start with the bag in the front rack. Go into a front squat and then as you extend, drive the sandbag fully overhead into a push press. Remember to finish the rep with full extension and ears in front of elbows, and repeat. String a few of these bad boys together and any athlete will be quickly humbled.
Bent-Over Row:
This is an isolated movement sandbag workout targeting critical back, shoulder and arm muscles, especially the lats and shoulders. Start in a squat stance, move your hips back and bend at the waist, keeping your back straight. Pull the back to your chest, making sure to keep the straight back and pinch the shoulder blades together as you finish the rep. For extra credit, slowly lower the bag back to the starting position over 3 full seconds. This eccentric movement pattern is a great way to efficiently train muscle and build strength quickly.
Romanian Deadlift:
Another more isolated movement, this one is all about those hamstrings. While they may not have the curb appeal of the quads, strong hamstrings are the foundation for functional movement and injury prevention. Start with your sandbag on the ground, feet slightly wider than shoulder width apart. Rather than bending the legs and lowering your hips like a traditional deadlift, this variation shifts the hips backward and bends at the waist. Legs should be slightly bent as necessary, but as you drive the hips forward and extend fully to the up position, you should feel the engagement almost exclusively in your hamstrings. If you feel it in your lower back, that is a sign that you are rounding rather than keeping your back straight as you complete the rep.
Split Squat:
This one is a real leg burner. You can do this with the bag with the bag behind your head on your shoulders, or to up the difficulty, in the front rack or bear hug positions. Start standing with feet roughly shoulder width apart, and step backwards with one leg into a lunge position. Keep your chest high and proud and go all the way down until your knee touches the floor, then step back up to the starting position. Alternate legs or do 5 - 10 on the right leg followed by the left leg. This under-rated movement not only yields killer quads and hamstrings, but also requires core and stabilizer muscle groups to fire in order to stay balanced on the way down, giving an added benefit.
While there are over 300-plus movements you can do with a single sandbag, these are some of our favorites that we make sure show up often in our daily workouts. Variation is great and necessary, but keeping some core movements in heavy rotation will help build strength and help give measurable results as you get stronger over time. Now grab that sandbag and go get after it!"
https://www.bruteforcetraining.com/blogs/bf/5-reasons-to-try-a-20-lb-weighted-vest-for-a-great-workout,"Weighted vests are a popular workout tool for both men and women. A 20 lb weighted vest is an excellent option for a low or high-impact workout. They have been proven to help burn more calories and improve overall conditioning.
The convenience of a weighted vest cannot be denied. It’s a grab-‘n-go!
The adjustable 20 lb weighted vest by Brute Force is an ideal weight for all your training needs. This simple one-piece design is easy to use and is a leader in weighted vests.
Here are 5 solid reasons to consider using a weighted vest in your next workout.
Versatility
A 20 lb weighted vest is an extremely versatile piece of training gear.
They are perfect for upping your game when you are speed walking, doing a variety of home workouts, or even for more complex cross-training routines.
The versatility of the Brute Force Training Vest 3.0 cannot be beaten. It's customizable and is the most comfortable weighted vest out there. The minimalist design hugs close to your body while allowing you to have unrestricted movement and easy breathing.
The added resistance of a 20-pound weighted sports vest is ideal for raising the level of your current cardio work and bodyweight training. It isn’t an overwhelming weight, however, you can add additional weight at any time, if so desired.
Your one vest can be easily used for both cardio and conditioning training, to help you become a better athlete or simply to get more toned and fit.
Affordable
There is a real pay-off to using a 20-pound weighted vest.
The Brute Force 3.0 vest is affordable and allows you to alter your workouts without the huge expense of some other equipment on the market.
Unlike the price of heavyweight equipment, the vest is a simple add-on tool to give you the desired intensity without the huge price tag.
Portable
A weighted vest is a convenient, all-in-one piece of equipment that can be taken with you anywhere.
There is no need to buy a huge weightlifting station that takes up valuable space in your home. Your vest is space-saving! It stores easily in your closet or gym bag.
Simply wear your 20-pound vest right over your workout clothes. The slim fit is easy to wear on hikes while training, without having to lug around a workout bag.
Nothing could be simpler. Just strap it on and begin your workout.
Strength and Endurance Building
Weighted vests provide the added weight needed for building your endurance and strength.
Carrying extra weight during your aerobic or training exercises requires more effort and after only a short period of weighted vest use, you will see your effort rewarded by how your overall strength and endurance have grown.
“One recent study found that weighted vest training improved blood lactate thresholds for runners. This means they were able to tolerate faster speeds for greater periods of time before fatiguing.”
Vests allow for better results. For example, if you utilize a 20-pound weighted vest in your running training, you will be amazed at your increased speed and endurance results when you train without the vest again.
We all wonder how heavy our weighted vests should be in the beginning. For beginners, try using a quarter of the max weight to start off with and gradually add on as you begin to feel comfortable with your vest and weight. If you have exercised with a weighted vest on before, use a weight that will give you more of a challenge when training.
Different weights will be good for different activities. Familiarize yourself with how to adjust the weight on your vest so that transitioning between exercises will be as smooth as possible.
Cardiovascular Benefits
When you train in a 20-pound weighted vest, your cardiovascular system works hard.
This extra effort helps to strengthen an athlete's lungs and the body’s ability to use oxygen. Weighted vests assist your cardiovascular system to deliver fresh oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and more to the organs and cells in your body.
Your cardiovascular system is very important to your overall health, and a weighted vest can aid in building up that strength.
The Final Lift
A 20-pound weighted vest is a versatile and important workout tool for men, women, and even older children.
A weighted vest is wonderful for increasing your overall cardiovascular health during your workouts and training. It can also add to your weight loss routine by helping you to burn more calories. Simply adjust your workout by adding your desired weight.
Whether you are a seasoned pro or relatively new to working out, a weighted vest can be the perfect workout tool to help up your game. It can deliver the results you desire, faster."
https://www.bruteforcetraining.com/blogs/bf/7-exercises-you-can-only-do-with-sandbag-training,"Sandbag training has taken the fitness world by storm over the last few years - and with good reason. The unstable load created by sand engages muscles differently than traditional equipment, and the added effort needed to stabilize the load enhances cognitive function. While many of the movements we use are similar to traditional weight training, here are some great exercises that can only be accomplished with a sandbag.
Brute Force Burpee
The exercise everyone loves to hate just got even harder. Start with the bag on the ground, do a pushup and then jump your feet forward, stand up and get the bag all the way over your head as efficiently as possible. This sandbag training is the real deal, and will quickly humble even the fittest athlete.
Bear Crawl and Drag
Bear Crawl and Drag is one of our favorite sandbag training exercise here at Brute Force HQ. A new twist on a classic, start in the bear crawl position with the bag between your hands on the floor. Crawl forward a few steps, then while balancing one one arm, use the other to reach back and pull the bag as far forward as possible. Continue alternating crawling and dragging and feel the burn in your shoulders.
Burden Carry Sandbag Training
Sometimes, it doesn’t need to be complicated to give a great workout. The simplest exercise on this list, or maybe on any list, is also one of the world’s oldest. Sling your sandbag over a single shoulder, or rest in behind your head across both, and cover some distance. That’s it. You will be surprised how quickly that sandbag gets heavy, and will gain an appreciation for our ancestors who used to have to carry food, water, and other supplies for miles.
Bear Hug Squats
Another classic movement with a sandbag training specific twist, the bear hug squat is just like a goblet squat, but rather than a kettlebell or dumbbell, squeeze the sandbag in a bear hug position - without the use of the handles. Don’t be tempted to rest the weight on your shoulder, as the bear hug position should keep the bag under your chin and use grip and arm strength to keep it in place.
Shoulder to Shoulder
Similar to a push press, this exercise has you shifting the sandbag from shoulder to shoulder via overhead press in order to really engage core stabilizers and showcase the unstable load. There is no real comfortable way to hold the bag as you change shoulders, and your arms will be screaming in no time.
Overhead Toss Sandbag Training
This one is great for building and enhancing neuromuscular coordination by engaging various stabilizer and neutralizer muscles. Start with the bag on the ground, get your hips low and explode upward as you throw the bag up and over your head behind you. Let go earlier than you think in order to achieve maximum height.
Shoulder Slams
Shoulder slams are a staple here at Brute Force HQ, and for good reason. Not only do they help us alleviate a little stress as we slam the bag into the ground, but the exercise is very functional from an evolutionary perspective.
While there are over 300-plus movements you can do with a single sandbag, these are some that you can't do with any other piece of equipment, so they're a fun addition to a more traditional workout.
Now that you've got some new moves to pair with your new gear, grab that sandbag and go get after it! If you're looking for more moves to build strength, check out our other article to level up your workout."
https://www.bruteforcetraining.com/blogs/bf/81487745-garage-gym-reviews-of-the-brute-force-sandbag,"What’s functional strength?
Being able to use your strength in environments that are outside of the gym. Such as lifting cars off of old grandma’s or rolling boulders up mountains.
One way to build this type of strength (or close to it) is by lifting things that aren’t precision calibrated like a barbell and bumpers.
A low tech device that is becoming more popular in functional strength circles is the sandbag. Sandbags provide a killer workout that you can do at anytime and anywhere. In my search for the best sandbag available, I stumbled across the fine folks at Brute Force.
Today, I’m going to review the Brute Force Sandbag and let you know whether it’s worth dropping your hard earned benjamins or not.
Let’s do it."
https://www.bruteforcetraining.com/blogs/bf/are-sandbag-workouts-effective,"One of the hottest trends in fitness-- sandbag training-- saw a massive increase in popularity during the pandemic. With over 300 movements with a sandbag, many are ditching barbell setups in favor of the versatility of sand. So how do sandbag workouts compare to traditional weight training? Let’s break down some of the key benefits.
Unstable Load Training Works More Muscle Groups
While traditional weight training focuses on isolating muscle groups, the sandbags engages smaller fixator and neutralizer muscle groups. You get the benefit of training your primary muscle groups and those that are not easily engaged. If functional fitness is the goal, sandbag training adds an extra layer of complexity to movements. Sandbags enhance overall gains when compared to static training. Another advantage is that when you force different muscle groups to work together, you are enhancing neuromuscular coordination. Not only are you building muscle, but you are actually giving your brain a workout as well.
Train From Anywhere
We all know that when it comes to fitness, consistency is key. The compact and adjustable nature of fitness sandbags allows the functional athlete to tarvel with them easily. Instead of uncomfortable hotel gyms, why not throw an empty sandbag in your carryon and fill it at your destination? A sandbag can be kept in your car so that you can crank out a quick but effective workout.
Dynamic Movements Lead to More Efficient Workouts
Incorporating dynamic movements into your workout such as power cleans, thrusters or burpees give you a total body workout that will leave you feeling completely drained with fewer reps and less time spent switching between movements and equipment. Formats popularized by Crossfit such as a 20 minute AMRAP (As Many Rounds as Possible) or descending repetitions (21-15-9) are short and sweet, but pick 3 movements and you have an instant sandbag workout on the go. The combinations are endless, and the results will speak for themselves.
Train Like the Pros
Find out why sandbag workouts are the top choice for professionals who rely on functional fitness for their livelihood. Sandbag training is the go-to choice for police, military and fire athletes who need to cultivate peak performance in order to succeed on the job. The unstable nature of sand more closely replicates real world situations than traditional weight training, providing a key advantage in the field - when it matters most.
Understanding the true versatility of sandbag workouts will help you achieve consistency, strength gains and metabolic conditioning like very few other pieces of equipment out there. Let’s take a look at a classic sandbag workout to see why so many functional athletes reach for their sandbag first.
Descending Repetitions, 21-15-9 of:
Bear Hug Squat:
Brute Force Burpees:
A favorite here at HQ, the Brute Force Burpee takes the exercise everyone loves to hate and takes it to the next level. Starting with the bag on the ground, grab the handles, kick your feet back into a front leaning rest, do a pushup and then pop your feet back to the starting position. Now lift the bag over your head from the ground, fully extending into an overhead press. That’s one.
Shoulder Slams:
Start with the bag on the ground, grab the suitcase handles and yank the bag up onto your shoulder while keeping your hips low and back straight. Stand up fully, and then with as much force as you can muster, slam the bag onto the ground. (Make sure you are on a smooth surface to prevent premature wearing of the material). Functional, practical movement patterns showcase the unique nature of sandbag training.
When combined, these three movements will hit just about every muscle in your body - including the hard-to-train secondary groups we discussed earlier. Each of these movements featured are also unique to sandbags, showcasing why this training tool has gained such popularity in recent years."
https://www.bruteforcetraining.com/blogs/bf/awkward-terrain-odd-objects-sandbag-training-for-ocr,"Why you should use sandbag training
Using a sandbag to work out is a form of functional training, and one of the best ways you can improve your speed, strength, and agility for OCR. It continues to grow in popularity and any serious adventure racer is sure to add the use of sandbags and heavy objects during all forms of training. Why? Because every Obstacle Course Race out there has you carry, drag or toss some sort of unstable, odd object... so you better train that way!
Brute Force Sandbag Training for OCR
One of the biggest benefits of using Brute Force Sandbag Training for OCR is that it develops real-life practical strength. A lot of the activities and challenges during an adventure race require practical strength such as lifting heavy objects, jumping, lifting yourself, and having to navigate obstacles. Training with a sandbag prepares you for more awkward scenarios that deal with heavier weights, increase your grip and forearm strength, and allows you to climb over or under objects more easily. The strength developed during sandbag training is different from basic weight training in that immense balance is required to safely and properly handle heavy sandbags. With a barbell it's easy enough to push a weight in the air, but it's a whole different ballgame when it comes to sandbags and other heavy awkward objects.
Many new muscles will develop and strengthen during sandbag training that you were unaware of. These muscles help even out any muscular imbalances between larger muscles and using a sandbag forces your body to stabilize in many different, yet beneficial ways. A sandbag is unstable and continually changing form, which makes it a challenge just to pick up and hold. Lifting it and throwing it is that much more difficult and requires a lot more skill and finesse compared to a typical bar based workout.
When it comes to optimally building muscles sandbag training must be incorporated into any fitness routine you're using to become a better OCR racer."
https://www.bruteforcetraining.com/blogs/bf/brute-force-sandbags-and-weighted-vests-help-you-prep-for-obstacle-course-racing,"There is nothing more rewarding than the thrill of the chase in obstacle course training.
Have you ever tried one?
Whether you are a seasoned pro or a newbie to the obstacle course world, you will need to train to the best of your abilities to fully prepare for the big day.
Steps For Preparing for An Obstacle Course Race
So, you have decided to sign up for an upcoming obstacle course race. What next?
You’ll want to start training for the race, right away! The course will most likely include 10-20 obstacles that involve some type of intense running, jumping, climbing, hiking, and crawling through a unique set-up of muddy, uneven terrain.
You will need your body to be ready!
Here are some simple steps that you can take to prepare.
Sign up:
First, sign up for your course! Join with a friend if you can. It is always better with a friend to accompany you on your training journey.
You and your training partner can support each other during your tough training routines and can celebrate each other's achievements on the big day.
Remember to opt for any alerts that will let you know about start times, venues or changes, etc.
Choose the right course:
There are usually different course levels, based on ability. You can choose between the more complex elite courses for seasoned athletes and the non-elite courses for beginners.
Do some shopping around to find the course level and registration price that suit both you and your pocket and remember to get as many details as possible.
Gather supplies:
What clothing or equipment will you need on race day? It is important to find this out early so that you can start training with them before the race.
Things like compression shirts, sports bras, gloves, knee/elbow pads, and shoes should be collected at this point.
Be sure to purchase shoes that are designed for OCRs. They should be great for gripping and have excellent drainage. Also, try to get your hands on some training gear that will help you reach your training goals: weighted vests and sandbags, etc. (more on that below)
Strength Training and Running Training:
You need to train beforehand to be at your strongest because, during the obstacle course, you will find yourself in a constant state of stop-n-go. So, you will need an appropriate training plan to train for this.
A combo of scheduled weight training, running and cardio exercise is ideal.
Improve your diet:
When facing an upcoming OCR, you’ll need to fuel your body well to power your training. Speak to someone who knows about the right kinds of foods to help build your strength and endurance.
Try to include plenty of fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins. Also, remember to Hydrate! Being properly hydrated can not be stressed enough.
Sleep for OCR Training:
Rest and recovery are achieved best while you are asleep, so get enough sleep to help you reach your goals.

https://www.bruteforcetraining.com/blogs/bf/crossfit-training-with-a-weighted-vest,"CrossFit is intense. CrossFit can be brutal. BUT, CrossFit gets results. By adding a weighted vest, your game leaps from great to phenomenal.
Why CrossFit?
CrossFit is the perfect high intensity training for building both strength and endurance. Adding a weighted vest to your functional CrossFit workouts will take you to a whole new level of fitness.
CrossFit movements are based on simple, everyday actions. Your typical gym moves like lifting, squatting, jumping, pulling and pushing are all utilized in a new way to burn calories and build muscle.
Do you want ripped abs? Actually, do you want ripped anything? Then CrossFit is for you.
A Growing Phenomenon
CrossFit has an unbelievably massive following and the increasing numbers aren’t slowing down. Followers include pro-athletes, celebrities, first responders, the military and everyone in between. They all have one goal in mind: to be the most powerful athlete that they can be.
Gyms and trainers across the planet offer CrossFit WODs to their clients. It’s a great workout for everyone – including kids. CrossFit workouts incorporate many gym tools like kettlebells, dumbbells, bars, sandbags, ropes and rings just to name a few. The cardio aspect often involves rowers, running, bikes, box jumps, skipping ropes and the list goes on.
A weighted vest is the ultimate CrossFit accessory to add-on as it ups the anti in every one of these activities.
Upping Your Game with A Weighted Vest
When you wear a weighted vest in your CrossFit workout, you are adding weight to your frame making everything you do, including just standing, that much tougher. This added weight increases the intensity of your workout, helping you burn calories, gain strength, build muscle, and increase your overall endurance at a faster rate.
The extra resistance can help shake up any CrossFit routine or add a little spice if you feel like you've hit a plateau.
The simple design of the (Anti Plate Carrier) APC weighted vest 3.0 by Brute Force is the most comfortable weighted vest available on the market. It is plate free so there are no uncomfortable plate weights hampering your movement. The Brute Force 3.0 Vest design consists of 10 flexible 2-pound weight packets filled with their proprietary recycled steel blend. They are adjustable in length, width and are constructed out of fabric that will not only last you years but will allow for uninhibited breathing.
It's so comfortable you will forget you are wearing it. This vest will move and flex with every twist and turn of your body. It doesn't restrict any of your movement, allowing for a great CrossFit workout.
You’ll forget it is there as your workout intensifies. Breathing is never inhibited the way it is in some of the weighted vest options. It really is the best weighted vest for CrossFit or indeed any workout.
The Brute Force vest has adjustable straps for versatility, a carry handle, breathable aerospace mesh panels, and is made out of 1000D military spec Cordura.
The Sweet Rewards
There are many benefits to using your weighted vest in your CrossFit workouts.
- The use of the vests can increase your VO2 (that's how much oxygen your body is using during your workout).
- The added resistance can help increase your speed
- Your muscle and cardiovascular endurance will improve
- Muscle mass increases
On average, women add around 14 lbs of weight to their vests, while men typically add 20 lbs or more. No matter who you are, it is recommended to start with a lower weight and work your way up as your goals change.
CrossFit Lingo
Once you strap on your super comfortable weighted vest, you may want to try out a beginners CrossFit class in your gym.
CrossFit can feel like its own world, and it has its own unique language.
Here are a few common new words that you may want to know as a beginner in a CrossFit class:
- WOD: Workout of the Day
- EMOM: Every Minute on the Minute
- AMRAP: As Many Reps as Possible
- Box: A CrossFit gym with the bare necessities to perform all the WODs.
- Ladder: A series of exercises where you increase the number of reps by 1 each time they are performed. (i.e. 5 squats, then 6 squats, then 7 squats …)
- SQ: Squat
- PR: Personal Record refers to when you reach your personal best in a given exercise. For example, completing a certain number of push-ups in a minute.
- Hero WOD: These workouts are named after first responders who have died in the line of duty. These workouts are especially difficult to remind CrossFitters of the sacrifices that these men and women made for their country.
Final Thoughts
Adding a weighted vest, like the Brute Force tactical vest, will up your game and help you to see the results that you desire much faster than without. It is quickly becoming the CrossFit essential gear.
CrossFit with a weighted vest is an intense and wonderful workout. You can enjoy weighted vest workouts if you are ready for a serious challenge. Go on - give it a try!

https://www.bruteforcetraining.com/blogs/bf/functional-fitness-on-the-road,"Vacations are the perfect time to disconnect and relax, but that doesn't mean your workout routine should suffer.The problem with vacations and working out is that they just don't seem to go together. Packing up all your workout equipment to make sure you don't get too far off track can be a daunting, if not impossible task. If you're used to free weights, there simply isn't any convenient way to load a bunch of plates and bars in a bag or trunk. On the other hand if you have become accustomed to working out on machines, replicating that routine is even more complicated. You have to ask yourself, will the hotel have the machines I'm used to? If not how do I do my routines with free weights? If you're enjoying the great outdoors, then all of those questions and concerns become even greater. So what can you do? How do you stay in shape on vacation?The answer may be simpler than you think-- sandbag training.
If you haven't done it before, now is the time to start. Sandbag training offers the ultimate in portability and is literally a gym in a bag. One of the many benefits to this type of training is the ability to replicate real life gym moves without the need to carry tons of equipment around. Presses, bent over rows, curls, squats and a variety of other conventional and unconventional exercises can all be accomplished with a sandbag. Plus, the bag can be folded and placed in almost any suitcase for travel all over the world. Typically, as the name would imply you fill the bag with sand, but rice, dried goods or other native options might be used. Just be sure you know the exact weight and don't fill the bag with anything dangerous, think canned goods.
Another advantage to traveling with sandbags is the challenge they present. You will find yourself struggling with a weight you can normally manage easily, because the weight naturally shifts. You also have to think through how to hold and carry these bags, which provides just the right amount of mental stimulation for your workout.
When you select a sandbag to travel with you will want to find a company that stands behind their product, offers a bag as tough as you are and is thoughtfully designed. Brute Force sandbags make an excellent choice because they offer different types of bags for different workouts, bags that have multiple handles (which is important when executing various lifts) and military grade materials.
Choosing workout equipment to travel with is much like choosing a travel partner. You want them to be tough, easy going and hassle free. Brute Force Sandbags offer all of that and more, which is why they might just become your favorite travel partner of all."

https://www.bruteforcetraining.com/blogs/bf/garage-gym-ideas,"Tell your car you are kicking it out. Your gym is moving in. Seriously! We have some fantastic garage gym ideas.
Your Garage Is the Perfect Place For A Gym
A garage is a perfect space for a home gym. It's almost as though it was made for it.
It’s solid. It’s tough. It can handle the weight.
When you clear out your garage, you’ll be able to see that it is just the right size for your gym and, while somewhat separate from your home, it is readily available without having to drive anywhere!
A garage is ideal for the equipment that you will need and having a designated space that is customized by you, right at your fingertips, is a huge bonus.
Garage Gym Ideas Prep
With a bit of elbow grease, you could have the perfect home gym in just a few hours! If you are wondering how to make a CrossFit gym of your own, here are some garage gym ideas to get started:
Declutter:
The first thing you will need to do is declutter and reorganize your garage. Removing all of your belongings will help you to see how much space you will have to work with.
See this as a perfect opportunity to organize your life and create a unique space that is all about you.
Envision:
When you stand back and see your space free of your belongings and debris, you’ll realize how open it is. Imagine what kind of energy and look you'd like for your gym.
Remember that you can have several “areas” in your gym - anything from a yoga mat area to a weight training section. Rowing machines, strongman equipment, and bikes work well too.
Create The Plan:
Your CrossFit garage gym layout is very important. Sketch out ideas of where you’d like to place your equipment and how they will fit. Measure your space and locate the best spots for any large equipment.
Tape out a map on the floor of where things will go before setting it in place so that you get a clear idea of how it will all fit together. Like a puzzle, you will find the locations that work best for you, in your space.
Add Color:
Don’t be afraid to add energizing color to your garage gym. Positive quotes on the walls can add inspiration to your workouts. Colored floor mat tiles can add some fun or much-needed cushioning for your workouts.
Keeping things light and bright in your garage gym is a good idea. Including colors that you like will help to keep you motivated.
Add Light:
You will need plenty of lighting in your garage gym. If you don't have a window, be sure to add some lights to allow for good visibility, no matter what time you train.
Add Storage:
Make sure that you allocate some storage space for smaller equipment. Locker-type cabinets can hold your small items away neatly, while doubling up as handy surface tops for things like your water bottle, towel, etc.

https://www.bruteforcetraining.com/blogs/bf/sandbag-training-fill-in-the-gaps,"""I COULD TELL RIGHT THEN THAT SANDBAGS WERE GOING TO BE A BIG DIFFERENCE MAKER IN MY TRAINING.""
It was the summer of 2009 when I first had the chance to throw around a heavy sandbag. Before then I had only primarily used barbells and dumbbells. Throw in the few times I trained with kettlebells and that was the most unorthodox type of training I had done up to that point.
Let me tell you I was straight up humbled the first time I threw around sandbags but, as much as it humbled me, it also got me hooked. I could tell right then that workout sandbags were going to be a big difference maker in my training. And not just a difference maker within my own training, but for the athletes I worked with as well. (I think it’s done well over the years in helping produce 9 state championship gold medals in wrestling).
Since that hot summer day where I got absolutely dominated by sandbag training, I’ve made it a point to keep sandbags programmed into my training to help push my fitness and give me the ability to compete on another level... And there’s no doubt in my mind that sandbags have made an amazing impact on my success as an athlete within the sport of fitness.
So, WHY use sandbag training for competitive functional fitness (AKA CrossFit)?
Well, let’s think about the sport in itself first…
CrossFit is… “constantly varied functional movement done at high intensity”
To get GOOD at CrossFit you must be… “training for the known and the unknown.” Now that we know that, let me ask YOU a couple questions…
How will you react when sandbag training is included within a WOD or event you’re competing at? Are you going to freak out or are you going to be ready to rock and roll?
What I’ve witnessed over the years, and even now in present time, is in how some athletes, just ain’t ready.
Well, let me tell ya…
Sandbags will help fill the holes most regular strength and conditioning methods leave open.
So, if you’re an athlete competing within the sport of fitness and you want to be as successful as possible, you’ve got to be as well rounded as possible. For this, getting a steady dose of odd-object style training in with sandbag training is essential. While your training should primarily be composed of fixed and balanced objects like barbells, dumbbells, and kettlebells, if you neglect odd-object training with sandbags, I feel you’ll be leaving a lot out on the table in terms of overall athletic development.
Think about it…
Sandbags “fill the gap” in regards to overall athletic development helping you build up more balance, coordination, and even the ability to react. These are all important attributes to have as an athlete, which in turn will help you be “ready for anything” especially the UNKNOWN. For instance, one thing I love (and hate at the same time) is in how sandbags like to shift and move on you when you lift them. This in turn forces you to shift and move as well. Just makes you a better all around athlete in my opinion.
But, WHY try to “fill the gaps”?
Well, training for CrossFit can sometimes become a bit too constant and specific. Even when you’re doing a completely unique WOD each day that’s challenging you in different modal domains, athletes are often times using a lot of the same, balanced out movements within these workouts.
Take Olympic lifting for example… It’s without a doubt you must be highly skilled and proficient with the Olympic lifts in order to be a successful competitor within CrossFit. But, in this day and age, if all you were to do were Olympic lifts and nothing else, you’d be neglecting a lot of the “unknown” which could help take your ability as an athlete to the next level.
Think about it this way… When you lift a barbell that’s balanced, the movement becomes rather predictable overtime. From the set up, the bar path...granted not every repetition is going to be exactly the same, but each is going to be more similar than they are different (at least that’s the obvious focus you want to have).
Now, let’s bring in sandbag training, where every rep is going to change, making you react just a bit differently to each one. Now you start stimulating muscles you didn’t even know you had. Smaller muscle that often times get neglected. So trust me when I say, you’ll definitely be sore the day after training with sandbags…I’ve seen bags bring down some of the “fittest” athletes around.
Don’t believe me?
Let’s look at the classic CrossFit WOD, “Grace”.
It’s 30 Barbell Clean and Jerks @ 135 / 95 for time.
Top male athletes are cranking this out in the low 2 minute to even sub 2 minute range while the women are around the same.
Average male and female times are around the upper 4 minute range.
What’s super impressive with the WOD Grace is in how I’ve seen a lot of athletes crank this out UNBROKEN. No easy feat at all, but what makes it somewhat “easier” is how the barbell is balanced. It should be expected that the more efficient you are with the bar, the better your time will be. Just makes sense right?
Now, test this same WOD out with a sandbag. You use the same weight and you’ll be in a world of hurt. Shoot, test it with an 80# or even a 45# sandbag and you’ll think the bags weighed closer to 135# or 95# (or more).
The difference the sandbags make are HUGE. From the shifting of the weight that forces you to react differently to each rep, the tax gripping the bag puts on your hands and forearms, and the punishment it puts on your core, a barbell Grace and sandbag Grace are going to be two completely different monsters.
But look at it all from this point of view…
Let’s say you get faster and more efficient at doing a sandbag Grace, you think your normal Grace time is going to improve?
You bet your ass it would ;)
And this is just one simple example of the difference training with sandbags can make. So just think about all of the other benefits that sandbag training can bring you as an athlete and in the sport of fitness. All you need to do is add in a single day of sandbag specific training to your weekly routine, and you'll see the difference (odds are you will add more than this after getting familiar with the bags).
So, if you’re not currently using sandbag training within your programming in some way, shape, or form, it’s time you start thinking about doing so NOW. Otherwise you’ll be leaving a LOT of athletic potential out on the table.

https://www.bruteforcetraining.com/blogs/bf/sandbags-for-a-great-workout,"With the pandemic feeling like it's fading away, now is the perfect time to find a reliable, simple, and super effective way to work out within society again! Whether you are working out in a gym, at home in your garage, or on the move as you travel. Workout sandbags are the most versatile tool for efficient, multifunctional training available to us all!
Sandbag training provides perfect strength, endurance and stability training for anyone from a beginner (like me) to a seasoned athlete.
Why Sandbags?
Lifting weights has been a staple in gyms as part of workout routines for generations, but sandbag training offers power along with stability and endurance. This is why the US Navy, the military and many other powerhouse institutions use sandbags in their workouts. Sandbags have become a favorite among many competitive athletes and celebrities who want a more challenging and well rounded workout.
Sandbags provide a unique challenge that replicates real-life situations. While working out with sandbags, the awkward nature of lifting the soft, unstable load forces your body to constantly re-align itself to balance and build not only your strength, but stability power too. It provides you with thorough, full body conditioning.
Unlike conventional training equipment, sandbags are soft enough to offer you a comfortable experience while remaining durable enough to provide you with hours of powerful training from your old equipment. Another perk to sandbags is that once they are empty they are so light that you can simply fold them up and take them with you anywhere! Just refill them when you get to your destination and, voila! You never need to miss a workout when you own a sandbag!
What Exactly Are Workout Sandbags?
Workout sandbags are precisely what they sound like - bags of sand, but with some remarkable differences. We have designed our training sandbags to be durable, pliable, and adjustable, making them ideal personalized workout tools!
Brute Force offers some of the best training sandbags available to give you the ultimate workout challenge. Brute Force sandbags are 100% American Made, and we are consistently the top-selling, top-performing, and most used sandbags in the industry. We built our sandbags to be tough enough to carry your workout to a new level.
Which Sandbag is Right For Me?
Here are a few things to keep in mind when choosing your own workout sandbag. Some workout sandbags have handles and some do not. They also come in different sizes and shapes. The most common though, is the rectangular sandbag that looks something like a duffle bag.
Brute Force has a fantastic range of excellent sandbag options to choose from and all of their bag kits come with weight fillers. If you prefer it, they are happy to pre-fill the fillers for you or you can opt to fill them yourself. (we recommend common playground “sand box sand”)
They include:
- The Classic- These are the most popular tactical sandbag kits. They come in 3 different, adjustable weight and size options (scout, athlete, strongman) ranging from 11lbs all the way up to 135lbs in multiple color options. With 8-Handles, this Sandbag gives you access to over 300 movements in one piece of equipment! They are made from durable 1000D Military-Spec Cordura and meet ALL specs for Unstable Load Training.
- Barebones- The biggest difference with this particular sandbag is that it does not have handles. Barebones Strongman bags are adjustable in weight from 75lbs to 125lbs. While the max capacity is 135lbs, this sandbag functions best between 85lbs and 115lbs. This sandbag is built for advanced sandbag training and is geared towards power development and grip strength.
- Brute Balls- Sand-filled, adjustable, soft stone/atlas stone balls. “The first of their kind”, the original Brute Balls came out in 2013, but the 2.0 version has been redesigned with Strongman and odd object training in mind. “The ultimate in just lifting something heavy and awkward.”
- Kettlebell Sandbags- One part kettlebell, one part sandbag, all parts awesome! Weighing less than 1 pound when empty, the Brute Force Kettlebell Sandbag™ is the ultimate training tool for people on the move or Deployable Fitness™ in a tactical environment. The Brute Force Kettlebell Sandbags come in 3 sizes: 15lbs, 30lbs, and 45lbs. These are their max capacities. They are all adjustable and suitably designed for beginner to advanced training levels.

The Ultimate Sandbag Workout
Getting started on a new fitness regime can be challenging, but the rewards are endless. Sandbags could be the next great addition to your new or current workout plan. Your dynamic resistance will be put to the extreme test when doing a sandbag workout. The off-balance nature of the shifting sand builds muscle and stability strength at an optimum level.
Give it a try! Sandbag workouts are unique, allowing personal customization. You can start by using your sandbag much like a replacement for your traditional barbell, or, if you are feeling bold, you can find many new, hard core options and open up your workouts to endless possibilities."

Article Contributed by Mark Briggs, 18+ years on the job. From the time I began my Law Enforcement career, I promised myself and my family that I wouldn’t end up in that pine box because I wasn’t in shape. To me, I surrendered the right to be unfit when I raised my right hand and swore that oath to Protect & Serve. Throughout my 18 year career, serving in both Patrol and SWAT, there were a variety of training methodologies that I utilized, but one of the most beneficial, hands down, was sandbag training.
Why sandbag training? Quite simply, it's a truly functional form of training that is highly adaptive to any fitness level. By utilizing the unstable load that’s provided by a sandbag, you’re forced to engage more muscle recruitment due to the shifting of the sand during any lifting movement.
Sandbags are also valuable training tools due to the varied load capacities and sizes of the bags. In the real world of Law Enforcement, you often find yourself going from stationary positions to very explosive behaviors (sitting in a car one second, to a foot pursuit and wrestling match with a suspect the next). Sandbags are great for all range of motion training scenarios you may find yourself in, and not only can they be used to improve your strength, but also your anaerobic capacity as well. For anyone who’s found themselves in the situation, you know this; If you can’t breathe, you can’t fight.
Sandbags On The Range
Using sandbags on the range is another personal favorite when it comes to range training. Using the sandbag to elevate your heart rate through a variety of movement patterns, and then making accurate shot placement far better simulates the physiological responses of a real gun fight than standing on the XX yard line and firing 2 rounds at center mass in XX seconds, right?!
While we program many different drills around strength and conditioning at each training session, the conditioning drill below is one of our favorites. It is also scalable and flexible based on your range requirements and/or limitations.
Sample Conditioning Drill
Start at the 50 yard line with a 50-70lb Athlete Sandbag Kit.
- 15 Sandbag Deadlifts, Fire till you hit
Sprint/Carry to 25 yard line:
- 10 Sandbag Cleans, Fire till you hit
Sprint/Carry to 15 yard line:
- 5 Brute Force Burpees, Unload/Reload
Sprint/Carry bag back to start.
Currently, I have teamed up with with Brute Force to provide a series of different tactical fitness training ops for both patrol and SWAT at different locations throughout the country. We believe that this type of training is a game changer and provides a much more ""Real World"" training experience. Many of the departments who have taken the training have not only bought into the idea of this training, but have implemented it into their regular PT regimens.
If you want to up your fitness level, add a new wrinkle to your training and have a little fun doing it, think seriously about adding sandbag training into the mix. Trust me, you’ll be glad that you did. The benefits of sandbag training for law enforcement are unparalleled."
https://www.bruteforcetraining.com/blogs/bf/unstable-load-and-odd-object-training-functional-and-effective,"As the fitness industry continues to evolve in both training concepts and equipment development, a much more robust and readily accessible pipeline of goal specific fitness programming is at our fingertips via local and commercial retailers, social media, and downloadable applications. With so many training trends, equipment gadgets, and “online” trainers, it is often difficult for the average consumer or fitness enthusiast to make informed choices on what types of training such as unstable load training are right for them.
“Functional” training has gained tremendous momentum, over the past decade, earning its very own fitness programming category, and continues to top the American College of Sports Medicine’s coveted annual top ten leading fitness trends in the world. Social media, internet, and television have all provided tremendous recent exposure of Strongman events, CrossFit competitions, tactical strength and conditioning, and obstacle course races, all proclaiming functional training and functional fitness as a primary training modality.
Originating in Physical Therapy, Functional fitness is a blend of traditional and unconventional training methods, using a variety of different equipment and movements in preparation to perform any physical activity relative to sport, activity, or occupation. Similar to sports specific training in its continuum and programming, however, quite polar opposite in that there is no specific sport, event, or physical activity in consideration, but all sports, events, and/or physical activities to remain prepared to competitively perform, including basic activities of daily living. In fact, functional fitness was first born by physical therapists providing movement specific therapy to those patients suffering from occupational injuries most commonly resulting in overuse, imbalances, and/or lack of mobility/flexibility. Today, functional fitness has been reborn is more dynamic, compound movements for the purpose of improving performance whether it be competitive or occupational.
Enter unstable load training:
“The ability to lift or unconventionally move an odd object or unstable, uneven load efficiently and effectively with the intent of improving functional work capacity & performance.”
Most commonly, this resistance is shifting throughout the exercise, forcing the user to not only focus on primary movers, but synergistically engage smaller fixators and neutralizers to stabilize the load in effort to move it effectively through the desired path. Unless an athlete’s single fitness goal is muscle hypertrophy, as is only a mere 1.8% of all competitive and recreational athletes, it is absolutely vital to training adaptation and translation to include free weight exercises in all planes of movement, as the body physically and neurologically performs as a single unit. However, the training continuum is not perfect. Different sports and events share many shades of gray. That said however, unstable load training is the single most effective training concept to develop neuromuscular and stability adaptations necessary to perform effectively in the other 98.8% of athletes in competitive, tactical, and/or recreational events.
A key core concept of functional training involves unstable/uneven load exercises and equipment. Do not confuse instability exercises with unstable load training, which places the user/athlete on an unstable surface such as a balance disc, Bosu Ball, or balance board. Unstable load training uses a variety of unconventional equipment such as sandbags, kegs, stones, specialty barbells, or by varying the resistance in either unilateral or bilateral exercises and most commonly placing the user on a stable, firm surface. The intentional training outcome is to move the resistance effectively, efficiently and precisely. As odd objects, sand, and water are uneven and/or shift, joint, muscular, and neuromuscular activities increase as maximum force of prime movers decrease. This is considered “inhibitory post synaptic potential” or the need to produce force in an open environment as well as to stabilize the body as force is exerted, necessary in nearly all of sports and tactical occupations. Again, the goal is to effectively perform the unconventional task at hand, training the body as a fully “functioning” unit, not to simply exert maximum force and isolate individual muscle groups.
Nearly all athletes are required to be functional in their sport or tactical occupation. The expectation is to perform their best under all conditions, including high stress, maximum intensities, and treacherous environments. These athletes can dramatically improve performance and functionality through incorporating unstable/uneven load training within their fitness programming.
Brute Force specializes in providing tactical, functional, and traditional athlete sports performance training by certified, and diversely experienced coaching staff featuring the gold standard in American made unstable/uneven load and odd object gear and equipment offerings.
Sandbag workouts have become the leader in unstable load and odd object training because of the very nature of the shifting sandbag. Their unpredictability offers a unique experience unlike that you'll get with traditional steel weights. We offer a variety of fitness sandbags in three sizes to suit loads from 5 to 125 lbs. Our 12-pocket weighted vests are also suited for sand or steel shot rather than their uncomfortable plate carrier counterparts, unevenly distributing the weight across your body to give you a different workout each time you put it on."
https://www.bruteforcetraining.com/blogs/bf/weighted-sandbags-for-the-strongman,"Sandbags are indeed the ultimate piece of workout equipment. The number of athletes incorporating sandbags into their Strongman workouts has grown massively.
What is a Strongman Workout?
A strongman workout is all about gaining strength.
Also called strongman training, it is a workout regime that combines the elements of functional movement with extreme weights. Functional exercises are based on natural movements like lifting, pushing or pulling, etc.
This powerful training provides the athlete with an exceptionally hard workout that helps to build muscle strength while improving stability and control.
Unlike powerlifting, strongman training focuses on your strength, power, and endurance building.
Why are Sandbags Good for Strongman Training?
Sandbags are an excellent weight source for strongman training.
Sandbags can target your muscles in a different way to traditional gym equipment like dumbbells and barbells.
Take the Strongman Sandbag by Brute Force, for example. It provides you with dynamic resistance due to the unstable weight of the shifting sand inside. They are unpredictable, so your body must continually balance and stabilize to cater to the momentum of the sand. Your workout is, therefore, never the same.
Reasons why Strongman sandbags are awesome:
They improve stability- Sand shifting within the sandbag is unpredictable. This movement forces your body to readjust, building resilience and strength constantly.
They improve future performances- Utilizing heavy fitness sandbags during a workout is tough! When working with sandbag weight, your strength and endurance improve in leaps and bounds.
They are versatile- Your strongman sandbag bag can be used with many different strongman exercises. This is because of the range of handles on the bag. Brute Force Classic Strongman Sandbags have eight handles. Four other pairs of handles mean you can use them for almost every exercise: squats, lunges, shoulder throws, twists, deadlifts, high lifts, rows, swings, hop-overs, and more.
They are adjustable- When you need a heavier workout, add more sand! You have any weight option you like in one piece of equipment!
They are affordable- Brute Force Strongman Sandbags are multiple purchases for the price of one! Because of their versatility and adjustability, you only need this one item for most of your workouts. This is also great when you don’t have the space or budget for more equipment.

https://www.bruteforcetraining.com/blogs/bf/weighted-vest-benefits,"Weight vests are getting increasingly popular as we begin working out more from home, especially as a new year and coronavirus strains are upon us. If your handheld weights aren't pushing your muscles to their limits, weight vests are a popular and effective solution.
You may see countless reviewers, fitness influencers, or online coaches preach the advantages of weighted vest workouts, but are they true? Does walking with a weighted vest benefit you? This article will break down the positives of weighted vest workouts and potentially justify their hype.
Are weighted vests safe?
Before we discuss the advantages of tactical weight and training vests, you must remember that they are contingent on you using the weighted vest properly. Firstly, ensure you use a comfortable, adjustable (ideally a vest with sand weights) and secure training vest.
Next, you will not feel the effects of weight harnesses and vests unless you fill them with an appropriate weight. Additionally, functional strength training exercises will trump maxing out your weights and sets. The goal of wearing a weighted vest is to gradually condition your body to lift, maneuver, and carry more weight, rather than overloading it for short bursts of exercise.
With that said, weight vests are perfectly safe so long as you don't add too much weight too quickly, which can overload your back, core, chest, and shoulders and potentially lead to injury. We recommend reading through our article ""Best weighted vest workouts"" to help you recognize how much weight to add to your exercises, which exercises you can add more weight to, and how to ensure you are not overexerting yourself.
What are the benefits of a weighted vest?
1. Build strength
Everyone gets excited at the thought of weighted vests amplifying your gains. Even though it may sound a little overhyped, you will almost always increase your strength and muscle mass so long as you pace your weight progression as you would with any workout.
A couple of researchers conducted a study in 2012 that analyzed the effect weighted vests had on young men as they worked out. This research breaks down their increase in muscle mass, endurance, and overall strength through empirical numbers. We highly recommend reading through it if you're curious about the science behind gains.
Another fascinating read is this study, which observed a weighted vest's ability to preserve muscle mass in older adults.
2. Improve Endurance and Running Performance
Everyone from long-distance runners, sprinters, and power walkers advocates for training with a weighted running vest, walk weights, or weighted bodysuits. If you are running, jogging, or walking, acclimating your body to carry added weight significantly improves your stamina and endurance.
Countless studies examine this topic because many Olympic athletes train with weighted vests religiously. If there weren't already enough reasons to get a weighted vest for running performance, we have more.
Suppose you are interested in sprints, dashes, or non-cross-country athletics. In that case, studies like this one show that participants training with heavier weight (greater than 5-8% of their body weight in the vest) experience more remarkable performance after training.
Additionally, for the long-distance track stars, conditioning your body to carry nominal intervals of weight (starting at 5% of your body weight) in a tactical vest results in easier breathing, better blood-oxygen levels, and of course, faster times.
3. Increase Cardio Intensity
For Crossfit proponents, wearing a weighted vest drastically improves your endurance, calorie burn, and fat loss. You can probably piece together why that is.
The more weight you train your body to carry while movement training, the more calories you burn. As a result, you gain better endurance, and fat loss becomes more efficient.
Common research studies indicate that nominal weight vest capacities (~10% of your bodyweight) lead to over 13% more calories burned as your exercise. That seems like a fair trade in our eyes.
We recommend seeking out specialty weight loss vests if you are interested in losing a lot of weight and CrossFit weighted vests if you want a well-rounded all-purpose vest. We can help you decide which popular vests might be best for you in our article, ""Best weighted vests.""
4. Strengthen Bone
Your weighted vest workouts stress your muscles, your joints and bones. Weight-bearing activities like focused strength training reduce your risk of osteoporosis due to your bone tissue adapting to the increased weight.
Workouts like dead-lifting, squatting, and power training improve bones like your pelvis, shoulders, knees, elbows, and spine. Check this research out to learn more!
There are countless reasons to get a weighted vest. However, of all the objective causes we covered above, the most crucial reason is taking care of yourself and your body.
Exercise is the key to maintaining health throughout your life. We can't expect to live long, perform seamlessly, or even feel energized as we age if we don't support our bodies. Invest in a weight vest, and your muscles, joints, and bones will thank you for it."
https://www.bruteforcetraining.com/blogs/bf/weighted-vest-workout,"If you've done any research online for improving your at-home workouts, then you've likely seen fitness influencers, gravity-defying calisthenic athletes, or coaches advocate for weighted vests. For around $160, you can equip yourself with a high-quality, adjustable, comfortable, and breathable vest that boosts the benefits of your workouts, especially if you do not see the results you want.
The APC weighted training vest is one of the best weighted workout vests you can buy. It uses sand pouches for dynamically adjusting your weight for various exercises as you grow stronger or need less weight for a more intense circuit.
You can also search for vests with weight plates, but you may experience discomfort while running or walking, doing gravity workouts, or maneuvering around.
What does a weighted vest do for your workout?
Weighted vests amplify the effects of at-home workouts. Studies indicate that wearing a weighted vest with 15% of your bodyweight inside can improve your gains, calorie burn potential, and endurance by 12-18%.
Weighted vests are great for warming up as well. As your body acclimates to heavier weight, more blood flows to your muscles, preparing them to support the increased load. Apply this principle to a workout, and your muscles will thank you.
Using exercises to improve power, you will see the bountiful benefits of weight vests over time. For home gym warriors, you may approach a point where you don't see the results you would like, or your workouts are not as efficient as they should be.
Weight vests are a small investment compared to gym memberships, gym equipment, or personal trainers, and they are incredibly versatile. You can use weighted vests to lose weight, increase strength, endurance, target muscle groups, and so much more.
For many, using a weighted vest is the key to becoming lean and fit at home.
How to start training with a weighted vest
Experts recommend starting with 5% of your body weight in your vest. Test out some exercises, or try a short circuit and add more weight if you need.
The goal of using a weighted vest is to push but not strain your body. If the workouts are uncomfortable to perform, your heart rate is too high, or you think you might injure yourself, reduce the weight.
Use your point of failure as a baseline. For example, if you can walk five miles with a 10-pound (4.5 kg) vest before your feet blister or your ankles buckle, start with three or four and work your way up. The same goes for reps of your favorite exercises.
At-home weighted vest workouts
Here are some of our favorite calorie-burning and muscle-growing vest workouts you can easily do at home. We also recommend compiling them into circuits to build several muscle groups simultaneously. We have a pre-planned routine for you at the end.
Strength training
Weighted vest pushups
Start with three sets of five. Ensure your arms move through the full range of motion, lowering your chest to one to two inches (3-5 cm) off the ground.
If you've ever seen people do pushups with people, 45-pound (20kg) weights, or tires on their backs, they almost definitely started with weighted vests.
Remember that it's better to do five pushups with good form than 10 with lousy form. You may feel muscles working by the end of your sets that you never have before.
Work your way up to three sets of eight to ten reps for each of these workouts, and then increase the weight from there.
Weighted vest squats
If you're looking for a killer quad workout at home, squats are a staple of any athlete's regimen. If you're considering squatting with a weighted vest, then you're likely stepping up from kettlebells or dumbbell squats.
Leave the hand-held weights to the side for now, and focus on your form, breathing, and range of motion. Start with three sets of 10, and as you get stronger, increase the weight. From there, you can pick the traditional weights back up in addition to your vest.
You may not be doing Bulgarian jump squats on the first day, but you will see results quickly.
Stair climb
A stair climb is one of the most demanding exercises you can do with a vest. Athletes see the best results when climbing regular stairs rather than using a stair machine, but use what is most convenient.
Climb the flights of stairs as you would usually, and pace yourself so you don't pass out and have to climb them again. Experts say five to seven minutes of continuous climbing, a minute of rest, and rinse and repeat.
Plank press-ups
This bodyweight ab workout will make you feel every pound in your vest. Start in a standard plank position, with your forearms on the floor. Extend your arms until they are straight and perpendicular to your body.
With your forearms still planted, press your body up and down. We recommend three sets of five for this killer bodyweight core workout.
The additional weight can cause you to hyperextend your back, so be careful with this exercise. If you feel too much strain on your back while pressing up, consider reducing the weight.
Cardio
For cardio, mountain climbers are great. You can equip your weight vest for running, and even using weighted vests for walking makes a huge difference.
You must have enough room to maneuver, breathe, and exercise your usual range of motion, so be cautious. The vest is supposed to bolster your workouts, not inhibit them.
Many people prefer jogging with a weighted vest, as it can be cumbersome on long-distance runs. Box jumps are another great exercise that makes you sweat.
You may need to re-learn how to do a box jump with the extra weight, as you can lose your balance in mid-air. Once you get them down, these weighted jumps push your muscles to the limit. Do as many reps per set as you can, but remember to pace yourself.
At-home circuit
Finally, after familiarizing yourself with the various workouts you can enhance with your new exercise machine, here's a sweat-inducing, fat-burning, and strengthening circuit you can do at home:
- Warmup (5lb, 2.3kg vest) - 45 seconds each
- Light calisthenics or jogging
- Stretches
- Jumping jacks
- High-knees
- Dumbbell stretches
- Weighted vest pushups (10lb, 4.5kg vest)
- Eight reps
- Stair climb (10lb, 4.5kg vest)
- 5-6 minutes
- Plank press-ups (10lb, 4.5kg vest)
- Eight reps
- Prisoner squats (10lb, 4.5kg vest)
- Eight reps
- Incline rows (10lb, 4.5kg vest)
- Eight reps
- Wide-grip or close grip pushups (10lb, 4.5kg vest)
- Eight reps
- Box jumps (10lb, 4.5kg vest)
- Eight reps
- Mountain climbers (10lb, 4.5kg vest)
- 45 seconds
Repeat the circuit 3-4 times, and we can guarantee you will feel the burn. Continue adding weight as you grow stronger and the exercises become less challenging.
Maintain the same difficulty level all the time; working out should never be easy. However, it should never be draining or painful. Remember to rest, hydrate, and pace yourself.
If you're new to the weighted vest scene, we may be biased, but we happen to think ours is the best. Get one here."
https://www.bruteforcetraining.com/blogs/bf/weighted-vests-for-running,"If you're looking for a way to reinvigorate your training regimen, running with a weighted vest is a great potential solution. We will give you the down-low on weighted vest benefits along with an intro to the world of running vests in general.
There are many options when it comes to a weighted running vest. You can find them in all different shapes, sizes, and colors.
We strongly believe that a weighted vest filled with sand is better than a traditional plate carrier because of the weight distribution and how much more comfortable it is. It conforms to your body while you run. Conversely, plate carriers are very uncomfortable and make you feel like you can't breathe.
But first, let's start with an intro of what a weighted vest is and what does a weight vest do.
What are weighted vests?
A weighted vest is a piece of clothing that you wear to add resistance or weight to your body. This can be in the form of weights, sand, or water.
There are many reasons why someone might want to use a weighted vest. Some people use them for fitness purposes, while tactical athletes might use them for training. People use weighted vests for higher level fitness reasons for an extra challenge and improve their overall strength and conditioning.
People who use weighted vests for tactical training typically do so in order to improve their speed, agility, and power.
Why would I use a weighted vest for running?
People use weighted vests for running because they want to increase the difficulty of their run and improve endurance. If you're looking for a weight vest for running, we recommend using one filled with sand. Using plates can feel like running with body armor. Some weighted vest benefits include:
- More efficient calorie burn because running with weight forces you to work harder, increasing perspiration and heart rate.
- Increases endurance over time by forcing your body to adapt to running while adding resistance
- Running with weight is actually recommended by physical therapists for anyone who has had an injury or surgery. Wearing a weighted vest will help you maintain fitness while recovering from an injury without the risk of re-injury caused by overtraining.
- Weighted vests are also great for warming up before running because they get your body ready for a workout. The added weight helps increase blood flow to your muscles and gets them ready for running!
- The best weighted vests are also great because they can be used in non-running workouts as well, such as plyometric exercises or weighted calisthenics movements like pushups, pull ups, squats etc.
What qualities should I look for in a good weight vest for running?
Some of the best running vests on the market are filled with sand, and we think you should know why. Weighted runners have been around for a long time, but many people don't understand how they work or what they do.
The weight distribution in a plate carrier is not even and can be very uncomfortable while running. A weighted vest filled with sand conforms much more to your body's shape and supports breathing easier while running.
When looking for a weighted vest, make sure that it is adjustable so you can find the perfect fit. It's also important to find one with high-quality construction because you don't want it to break on you when you're in the middle of your run.
We recommend finding a vest that has pockets on the side so you can easily store your belongings. This is a great feature if you're running long distances and don't want to carry a lot of extra weight with you.
Finally, make sure to find a vest that is comfortable! You'll be wearing it for extended periods of time, so it's important that it feels good against your skin.
The best weighted vest is the one that gets the results you want.
A weighted vest workout is a great addition to any workout routine, but it's important that you find the right weighted vest for your body and your fitness goals. If you're looking for a weighted running vest specifically, we recommend using one filled with sand rather than weight plates because it's much more comfortable, you'll wear it longer, and you'll be more likely to get out and exercise.
As you probably already know, sand is our specialty. In addition to weighted vests, we carry a full line of workout sandbags and kettlebells. If you haven't already joined our community, we urge you to get started with one of our training programs to learn about the power of working out with sand now."

Adjust your vest to your own comfort level, keeping it gently snug to your body. Have the weight fit your needs, and adjust regularly to give your workout some variety. Start with a weight that is lower than you think you need, and add to that.
The cardiovascular benefits and strength building from regular use of a weighted vest for women simply can't be beat."
https://www.bruteforcetraining.com/blogs/bf/why-sandbag-training,"Odd-object or sandbag training has been practiced for centuries and the makings of the sport of Strongman can be traced back to ancient history, far before society began to experience the phenomena of physical fitness. For the general population of habitual exercisers, however, this very primal style of training has been forgotten for many years in mainstream fitness as new tools such as barbells, dumbbells and high-tech machines have dominated the common weight room. The practice of moving stones, carrying logs and lifting heavy load is about as practical and accessible as it gets and is not only excellent for training elite level athletes but for mom and pop types as well.
The sandbag is one of the many implements that are included in Strongman-style training and provide a highly inclusive approach to core training for all levels of athletes through a diversity of possible movement. The affordability of sandbags, versus barbells and machines, adds to the accessibility of this tool and companies such as Brute Force Training have created top-quality implements with convenient features to maximize versatility. I tested the Power Combo sandbags by Brute on both myself and my own clients and here were some of our favorite ways to use them that you should try out, too.
Squats
Unlike most barbell squats, the sandbag squat can practically be self taught, if not at least coached to perfection in just minutes. Squats performed with a barbell, such as the back squat or front squat, often have greater requirements of mobility and pose greater risks to a beginner athlete. These type of squats can take days, weeks or even months to years to master and yet a sandbag squat allows you to move safely and effectively with generally very few cues.
Carry
A sandbag carry is about as simple as it gets: take the bag from here…to there. In practice, however, simple doesn’t mean easy. There are many ways to hold the bag – over the shoulders, in a bear-hug or a Zercher-style – each of which will make great demands of your posterior chain, core and obliques. Oh, and your soul because a max effort sandbag carry is no joke.
Clean and press
A classic Strongman event, the clean and press is often done with an axle bar. You may have also heard of the ‘clean and jerk’ in the sport of weightlifting, made more mainstream and popular by the training methodology and sport of CrossFit. Both of these movements take the weights from ground to overhead, yet the complexities of a bar can take years to master. Performing this movement correctly with a sandbag can take just a few minutes and teach the necessary fundamentals of explosive power and raw strength.
Brute Force Training Bags
One of the unique features of the Brute Force Training bags are the multiple handles that are especially great for first-time sandbag users. There are 4 sets of flexible soft-grip handles that facilitate a variety of grips and positions from which to grab the bag. These come especially useful for lapping the bag or getting it to the shoulder, such that may be a common necessity for obstacle-race athletes but could also be used to vary grip work in training.
The 1000D military-spec Cordura fabric and military-grade velcro is webbed with triple reinforced stitching and features YKK zippers, making this bag among the most durable to it’s competitors. The Brute Force collection includes the Mini, Athlete and Strongman sandbag kits that range from 25-125lbs at max recommended fill to suit a variety of athletic needs and strength. Brute Force also sells the Barebones and Heavy Hitter grip-less and heavier loading bags for more advanced sandbag users as well as Brute Balls, a soft option to atlas stones, another implement often used in Strongman.
Whether you’re a beginner to the practice of physical fitness or you’re a veteran of the weight room and sport, sandbag movements are a valuable training tool not to be ignored. The simplicity of Strongman movements that can be performed with a sandbag make them accessible to even the most newbie of trainees and can also add a new level of intensity to the seasoned athlete in adding strength to the posterior chain, creating explosive movement patterns, and developing core stability. Brute Force Training has created durable bags proven to last and withstand your toughest training sessions.

https://repfitness.com/blogs/rep-blog/13-benefits-of-a-trap-bar,"13 Benefits of an Open Trap Bar
Author: Aimee Heckel Published: 7/6/2022
You’ve probably seen it at the gym: the unique, hexagonal-shaped bar that can look intimidating to use if you’ve never tried it before. But turns out, it’s super easy to use – and incredibly beneficial. This bar, called a trap bar or hex bar, is arguably one of the most underrated specialty bars out there.
Due to its shape, trap bar allows for the equal distribution of weight around the body, instead of just in front like a regular deadlift. The bar also features dual, neutral-grip handles (standard and raised).
The Open Trap Bar is even more useful and versatile. The open-sided frame allows the lifter to step in and out of the bar and doesn’t limit the lower body range of motion. This makes the bar functional for a wide variety of movements, such as lunging and carrying.
Here are 13 reasons you should add an Open Trap Bar into your strength-training routine.
1. Less stress on the lumbar spine
One of the biggest benefits of the Open Trap Bar is it allows for a more upright torso position than conventional deadlifts, thereby reducing strain and stress on your lumbar spine. With a trap bar deadlift, the weight is closer to the midline. This makes the bar great for people who want to still perform a deadlift-like pull but reduce the demand on their lower back, either due to pain, injury, or the desire to mix up training. This can help you build more back strength before (or in addition to) tackling a straight bar deadlift. The Open Trap Bar can also be an alternative for back squats; work your legs without loading the spine from the top.
2. Improves your deadlifts
Open Trap Bar deads can help improve the technique and strength of straight bar deadlifts. Some lifters tend to hyperextend their lockout (with a slight backward lean) due to pulling the bar up against their thighs and to counterbalance the bar. This can lead to an increased risk of injury to the back. The Open Trap Bar reduces that hyperextension (it's awkward to lean back like that without falling over). An Open Trap Bar can help train you to not hyperextend and understand what a neutral spine feels like, so you’ll perform straight bar deadlifts more safely.
3. Keeps you lifting when you have limitations
The Open Trap Bar can allow lifters to do pulls when they are rehabbing or have a reduced range of motion. Want to work your quads in a compound movement but can’t squat to depth? An Open Trap Bar can provide an alternative.
4. Great for quads
The Open Trap Bar demands more quad than conventional deadlifts. It also hits your glutes and hamstrings. While it also targets your back, it works your legs more than a conventional deadlift.
5. Easy to learn
Open Trap Bar deadlifts are easier to learn and perform with good form than straight bar deadlifts. The neutral grip combined with the center of gravity being in line with your body (instead of in front of it) makes it easier to keep a neutral spine. New lifters and people not comfortable with their deadlift form (whether due to mobility, body proportions, or a mental block) can pretty easily find quick success with an Open Trap Bar. You probably won’t need to perfect your form for weeks or months before adding working weight on an Open Trap Bar. You can get right to business.
6. Different weight distribution
The weight with an Open Trap Bar sits to the sides of your body, not in front of you. You step into the open-hex shape, sit back, and pick it up, rather than bending forward to grip the bar. This shifts the feeling of the lift and is also great functional strength training.
7. Heavier loads/more power
Most people can lift about 5-10% heavier on an Open Trap Bar (with the low handles) than a straight bar – and even more with the high handles. Velocity has also been shown to be higher.
8. Grows your vertical
Loaded, vertical jumps with an Open Trap Bar can improve your jump power in other sports.
9. More forgiving for grip
Neutral handles (palms facing inward) are easier to grip than double overhand on a barbell, when grip strength can be a performance limitation. So, you can train your legs and back harder before your grip stops you. In addition, the neutral handles on an Open Trap Bar eliminate mixed grip and its related imbalances (and the risk of bicep tears or strains). And no need to suffer through painful hook grip.
10. Improve your Oly lifts
An Open Trap Bar can help Olympic weightlifters train their muscles for a clean pull, which requires a more upright torso position than a conventional deadlift allows.
11. Easier on the shins
If you want to keep the bruises and blood off your shins (or protect your workout pants), the Open Trap Bar eliminates the contact between your skin and the knurling of a straight barbell.
12. Great for tall lifters
Tall lifters (6’ and above) can struggle with keeping a flat back in deep angles, especially tall lifters with poor mobility. An Open Trap Bar provides a compound pulling exercise with less demand on mobility and flexibility.
13. Surprisingly versatile
An Open Trap Bar is more than just pulls. You can use it for all kinds of other exercises, such as neutral-grip presses (chest and overhead), floor presses, farmer’s carries, bent-over rows, push-ups, planks, Romanian deadlifts, rack pulls, shrugs, and more. Without the front bar in the way, you can also use the trap bar for lunge-style movements, including Bulgarian split squats. For home gym owners who already have weight plates, this allows you to do lunges and many other exercises without having to buy a whole set of dumbbells."

Author: Aimee Heckel Published: 5/19/2022
With Rep’s six adjustable benches, it can feel overwhelming to know how to pick the right one.
Each bench is different, with various combos of width, weight capacity, pad angles, and more. Benches range from lightweight (70lbs) to sturdier (125lbs); from 7-gauge steel to 14; and from $269.99 to $599.99.
But you don’t need to get in a shopping workout before getting in your actual workout. Here’s a quick guide to navigate Rep’s adjustable benches (that’s what the “AB” in the name stands for): AB-3000, AB-3100, AB-4100, AB-5000, AB-5100, and AB-5200.
Note: All of Rep’s adjustable benches feature:
- a grippy, textured vinyl pad that is slip-resistant, durable, and easy to clean
- flat and incline options
- precise manufacturing with state-of-the-art robotics
If you are new to lifting ...
Try AB-3100. This bench is the most affordable and the lightest weight, while still featuring six incline back pad adjustments and three seat angle options. It has a lower weight capacity (700lbs) than most other benches and doesn’t offer a decline position — but it’s still incredibly sturdy.
- 14 to 4-gauge steel frame with grooved rubber feet
- Ladder-style design allows for easy and secure angle adjustment
- Three legs instead of four leaves more space on the floor for feet when bench pressing
If you’re an advanced lifter (or want to lift like one) …
Go big with AB-5000. This is a sturdy bench, with a weight capacity of a half a ton. It converts into flat, incline, and decline, with seven different back pad adjustments and five seat options. Plus, this unique bench is the first on the market with zero gap in any position between the seat and back pad. Opt for the optional wide pad and seat to account for a broader frame, more shoulder support, and the ability to mimic a floor press.
- Slide seat forward and backward to eliminate the gap between the seat and back pad
- Optional leg attachment allows for decline variations
- Easy to move with urethane grip handle and wheels
- Anodized aluminum pop-in and bearing system makes angle adjustments easy and secure
If you have limited space …
AB-4100 is the most compact bench, taking up a mere 7.2SQFT of working space. Plus, it’s lightweight (85lbs) and easy to move, with a built-in upright storage post with rubber coating for extra stability and to protect the floor.
- Features 7 back positions (0 to 85 degrees) and 3 seat positions (0, 10, and 20 degrees)
- The closed ladder design prevents you from lifting the ladder out when adjusting your AB-4100
- The AB-4100 was designed to meet IPF Height Standards for the athlete looking to stay consistent with training tools
If you want versatility …
Want to hit multiple angles? AB-3000 offers flat, incline, and decline options. The back pad has seven adjustments, from 85 degrees upright to a -13 decline, and the seat pad also has five angle options. For decline, just swing the leg roller out from underneath the seat to secure your feet.
- Adjust the angle instantly and effortlessly by moving the bench into the desired ladder rung. Bonus: The chrome steel won’t chip and flake over time
- The vinyl cushion is textured and grippy so you won’t slide out of position
- Heavy-duty bolts, 7- and 14-gauge steel, and a weight capacity of half a ton
Or for even more options, AB-5100 has an optional leg roller attachment that affixes to the other end of the bench, by the back pad. This allows even more decline variations, down to -75 degrees.
- Heavy-duty, with 11-gauge steel frame, high-end finishes, wheel guards, thick vinyl, and more
- Unique anodized aluminum pop-in and bearing system makes angle adjustments easy and secure
- Urethane grip handle and wheels make it easy to maneuver
- Textured vinyl pad is slip-resistant, easy to clean, and durable
If you are a competitive lifter …
You’ll want a bench with three posts: two by your head and one by your feet, so you don’t have to worry about the feet of the bench getting in the way of your own feet when you’re setting up. The best comp-style bench is AB-4100, which not only has three posts, but also was specifically designed to meet IPF height standards.
- At only 85lbs this bench is lightweight and easy to maneuver
- The AB-4100 includes a built-in upright storage post with rubber coating to protect your floors and add extra stability
- The upgraded aesthetics of this bench means no compromises have to be made, especially with our launch of limited-edition colors
If you’re a large lifter …
Even the tallest athlete can stay in position on the long AB-5200. The total pad length for this bench is 55.25”, with the back pad alone hitting 42”. Support your head and shoulders whether you're lying down or seated upright. A wide pad (14” at its widest point, compared with 12”) is compatible with this bench. Bonus: If you want a spotter platform, this is the only bench with that option.
- The AB-5200 includes a built-in upright storage post that was designed for tight vertical storage, only taking up 2.5SQFT of space
- The closed ladder design on both the seat and back keeps the ladder securely in place when adjusting
- This bench has seven back pad angles( 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 85 degrees) and three seat pad adjustments (0, 15, 30 degrees)"

Author: Aimee Heckel Published: 5/31/2022
A high-quality weight bench is one of the first and most important pieces of equipment in a gym. Whether for bench pressing, step-ups, box squats, or split squats, there are tons of uses for a flat bench.
A flat bench is just what it sounds like: The single pad is flat and parallel to the floor, and that pad does not adjust into an incline or decline position. All flat benches are not the same. REP Fitness offers four types of flat benches, each designed to meet different needs. You’ll find benches with three legs or four; wide pads or standard; various weight capacities and storage options. Flat benches are also affordable, starting at just $149.99 and topping out at $239.99.
Here’s a look at REP’s four flat benches to help you pick the perfect one for your gym.
Note: All flat benches feature:
- A grippy vinyl pad that’s slip-resistant, durable, and easy to clean
- International Powerlifting Federation competition height
- Precise manufacturing with state-of-the-art robotics
The Flat Benches
- FB-3000: The Standard Flat Bench
- FB-4000: The Comp Lite Flat Bench
- FB-5000: The Competition Flat Bench
- FB-5050: The Wide Competition Flat Bench
FB-3000: The Standard Flat Bench
The FB-3000 is a solid, 11-gauge steel bench suitable for both recreational and competitive lifters. For powerlifters, the bench was designed to meet the International Powerlifting Federation (IPF) height standards, and its super grippy pad will hold you in position. It also features four legs, rather than three, which adds stability for other exercises like step-ups and split squats. FB-3000 is compatible with REP’s wall-mounted bench hanger, so you can store it up and out of the way to save space. It’s the lightest bench, at 40lbs, but it can handle a 700lbs load.Shop the FB-3000 Starting at $149.99
FB-4000: Comp Lite Flat Bench
The FB-4000 is a competition-style bench built to IPF standards, but with a tripod foot design for lifters who want more foot clearance under the bench. It’s sturdy, made from 14-gauge steel, with a weight capacity of 700lbs and features a 2.5” thick, durable vinyl pad that’s easy to clean. Upgrade for a wider, 14-inch pad for more shoulder support and for larger lifters. Bonus: with a steel handle and industrial wheels, this bench is easy to move around your home gym.Shop the FB-4000 Starting at $169.99
FB-5000: Competition Flat Bench
Serious lifters will appreciate this hardcore bench, made with 11-gauge steel with a capacity of 1,000lbs. It features a tripod foot design, so the legs are out of the way when you’re benching. The 4” thicker pad made from heavy-duty vinyl will hold you in place, and it can be swapped out for a wider pad, if needed. Although this bench can handle a heavy load, it only weighs 62lbs and takes up 7.36SQFT of space, and the steel handle and wheels make it easy to maneuver.Shop the FB-5000 Starting at $209.99
FB-5050: Wide Competition Flat Bench
This is like the FB-5000 bench, but with a wider pad. The FB-5050's pad is two inches wider (14”) and 4” thick. It’s textured to lock you into position and firm, yet not rock hard. As with the FB-5000, this bench is crafted out of 11-gauge steel, rated for a half a ton, and has a three-legged base to allow plenty of foot space on the floor. It’s easy to move around, with wheels and a steel handle, and takes up 7.36SQFT total.Shop the FB-5050 Starting at $239.99

https://repfitness.com/blogs/rep-blog/how-to-build-an-amazing-home-gym-in-a-small-space,"How to Build an Amazing Home Gym in a Small Space
Author: Aimee Heckel Published: 6/29/2022
You don’t need a big space to build an epic home gym. As Louie Simmons put it, “Big isn’t strong. Strong is strong.” If you can clear out the corner of your garage, basement, or even a bedroom, you can get in a killer workout from home.
And we’re not talking about bodyweight exercises with a few bands (not that there’s anything wrong with that). We’re talking full-on strength-training with weights, cables, cardio, the whole shebang. All you need is the right gear. Here’s how to do it.
PR-4100 Folding Squat Rack
The center of your small home gym is this compact but incredibly sturdy squat rack. It comes in two sizes, but the shallowest is 21.5” deep. This wall-mounted rack folds in on itself, so when it’s stored away it only takes up 6” of extra space from the wall. No floor space required.
Don’t let the small footprint fool you, though. The PR-4100 is as sturdy as heck, with 3x3” 11-gauge steel uprights and the ability to handle a half a ton in weight. And when you’re done, it’s easy to fold up. Bonus: It’s compatible with a bunch of optional attachments, like a landmine press, spotter arms, and a dip attachment.
AB-4100 Adjustable Weight Bench
The second must-have for any home gym is an adjustable weight bench, and the AB-4100 offers the most options in the smallest package. An adjustable bench offers more workout variations than a standard flat bench, and when space is tight, it’s all about multi-purpose use.
This super compact bench takes up only 7.2SQFT of working space and weighs only 85lbs, so it’s easy to wheel around. Choose between seven different back positions (0 to 85 degrees) and three seat positions (flat, 10, and 20 degrees). When you’re done, store it up and out of the way, thanks to a built-in storage post with rubber coating (for stability and to protect your floor).
Adjustable Dumbbells
If you’re working with limited real estate, you definitely don’t have space for a full rack of dumbbells. So, go with an adjustable dumbbell instead. It’s easy to change the weight on these, so it’s like having multiple dumbbells in one.
The 40lb set comes with two handles, four 5lbs plates, and four 2.5lb plates (plus collars to secure everything in place). If you need more weight, you can buy additional 10lb plates for the 40lb set. Or go with the 52.5lb dumbbell (with eight 5lb plates, two 2.5s, and two 1.25s).
Sabre Barbell
A barbell is an incredible versatile piece of equipment, and the Sabre can do it all at an affordable price. This bar is mixed-use, meaning it’s built for powerlifting, Olympic weightlifting, and cross-training/HIIT-style workouts. It features medium-depth knurling for good grip when you need it, but it won’t demolish your hands when you need to do high-rep speed work.Shop the Sabre Barbell
Equalizer Iron Olympic Plate Set
For a set of plates, go with Equalizers. Bumpers may be quiet, but they take up more space. Equalizers are thinner, high quality, and the larger plates feature symmetrical grip holes that add versatility. In addition to loading the plates on your barbell, you can also grip the holes for front plate raises, makeshift farmer carries, and other exercises, in lieu of more dumbbells or other equipment.Shop Equalizer Plates
Wall-Mounted Plate Storage
Store your weight plates up and off the floor with a wall-mounted storage rack. Opt for the double weight horn for extra storage. Just mount this unit on your wall and keep your plates organized and out of the way. This rack is made from solid steel, so it’s tough and aesthetic.Shop Wall-Mounted Plate Storage
Multi-Use Wall Hanger
Get the rest of your goodies off the floor with a Multi-Use Wall Hanger. This gorgeous, wall-mounted organization system can hold up to six barbells, or other gear, like jump ropes, weight belts, chains, and bands. Paired with the weight storage unit, and you’ve got a zero-footprint equipment solution.Shop the Multi-Use Wall Hanger
Speed Cable Jump Rope
Of course, you can get in cardio with no equipment (burpees, run, jump), but if you want to add some structure to your cardio, a jump rope takes up pretty much no space. This speed rope is adjustable and swift enough for double-unders and crossovers.
If you need a low-impact cardio option, the Ski-Row Dual Function Ski and Rowing Erg is an impressively compact piece of high-quality equipment that’s two machines in one. Use it for both rowing and skiing workouts.
Pull-Up Bands
Finally, top off your tiny home gym with some simple Pull-Up Bands. These small, lightweight bands can add a ton of options to your workout. Use them for warming up, recovery, to train pull-ups, and to provide extra challenges on compound lifts. These come in seven different sizes of varying widths and colors. A super inexpensive and easy way to round out your gym.Shop Pull-Up Bands
Other add-ons:
Looking for a little more?
If you want cables in your life and have the space for a power rack that doesn’t fold up, get the PR-4000 and add on the 80” Ares Cable Attachment (4-post series). The Ares is a fully integrated, functional trainer and lat pull down/low row attachment that attaches to a PR-4000 or PR-5000 power rack. It brings cable exercises inside the rack, while preserving nearly all the original functionality.Shop Now"

Author: Aimee Heckel Published: 7/7/2022
It takes a ton of abuse. It bears a heavy burden and is thrown around, bumped and jerked, and then often put away filthy to forget about until tomorrow.
But barbells need love, too.
After investing in a quality barbell, you want it to last – and continue working well as long as you’re working. Taking care of your bar will keep its spin smooth, maintain the knurling, and keep it looking shiny and new. Here’s how to properly care for your barbell so it doesn’t rust and bust.
What you’ll need:
- Snap-ring pilers
- Three-in-one oil or gun oil
- Stiff bristle brush
- Microfiber cloth
After Every Use
Clean the shaft: Ideally, you should clean the debris out of the knurling after every use. Regardless of the bar type and bearings in the shaft, cleaning the shaft is the same. If there’s noticeable dirt, debris, or chalk in the knurling of the bar, brush it out with the stiff bristle brush. Simply swipe back and forth as you rotate the bar to clean it out. You need to remove leftover chalk because any chalk left on the bar can hold humidity; that ultimately can lead to rust.
Oil the shaft: Once all the dirt and debris are off, finish cleaning your barbell by applying a couple drops of oil on a microfiber cloth. Wipe the shaft clean with that. That should take off any remaining blood, dirt, grime, or dust. The oil helps protect your bar and helps prevent rust and corrosion.
Store it properly: Don’t store your barbell loaded with plates. Other than basic gym etiquette (unrack your weight, bruh), leaving weight on your bar over time can cause it to warp. It’s best to properly store your bar in a barbell holder (either horizontally or vertically). If you don’t have one, store it unloaded on your rack J-cups. Just propping a barbell in the corner risks it being bumped and falling.
Dropping an empty barbell on the ground can damage the hardware inside, which can affect the spin or sleeves, damage the bearings/bushing, and break your barbell. Only drop a bar if it has bumpers on it to help absorb the shock.
Quarterly
Occasionally, you should take your barbell apart for a deeper cleaning. How frequently depends on your environment. If you’re in a pretty clean environment without a lot of dust and chalk floating around, you may only need to do this once or twice a year. If it’s a dirtier environment, like a garage or gym with a lot of dust or chalk floating around, you may want to take the sleeve apart quarterly (four times a year).
1. Clean the shaft.
2. Oil the shaft.
3. Disassemble the sleeve:
* Put pressure on the endcap and spin the sleeve clockwise until the cap pops off.
* Grab your snap-ring pliers. Use them to remove the two snap-rings.
* Next, pop out the pressure washer.
* Slide the sleeve back and remove the half-moon washers.
* Remove the final washer and slide the sleeve off the bar.
4. Oil the sleeve: Put some oil on your finger and apply it to the inside of the bearing. Flip the sleeve over and repeat on the other side.
5. Put it all back together: Replace all the parts in the opposite order as above.
* Slide on the sleeve.
* Put the washer in.
* Add the half-moon washers. Pull the sleeve up to help hold them in place.
* Add the pressure washer.
* Use the spring-clip piers to replace the spring clips.
* Screw the endcap back on counterclockwise.
* Give it a spin!"
https://repfitness.com/blogs/rep-blog/how-to-compare-power-racks,"How to Compare Power Racks
Author: Aimee Heckel Published: 7/6/2022
Picking a power rack isn’t a small decision, financially or functionally. With so many options on the market today, it can be tricky to decipher between the different companies and their offerings.
There are five key areas to consider when comparing power racks: Construction, design, consistency, attachments (the “ecosystem”), and value. Here is how REP’s power racks compare to others on the market:
Construction
Construction refers to things like the thickness of steel, welds, and paint. We use state-of-the-art robotics in our brand-new facility to construct our power racks, including laser cutting, robotic welding, and robotic painting all under one roof. This helps ensure a consistent, high-quality product and sets the standard for precision manufacturing.
Design
A 47” width helps ensure easy unracking and reracking of the barbell. Some competitors’ power racks are wider, and you’ll frequently see complaints of clearance problems when re-racking the barbell, creating a safety concern with a heavy squat.
Plastic liners on all attachments are standard. This is a high-end feature that helps protect the paint on your rack and keeps it looking new. Most competitors don’t offer this, or if they do, it’s inconsistently used.
We don’t use stickers. Every logo on the rack is laser cut or stainless steel to look great for years.
In addition, we pay attention to accessory details and upgrades, including chromed weight horns (competitors use a powder coat that immediately chips and flakes away as you slide plates on/off), angled grips on our multi-grip pull-up bar, and many other fine details.
Consistency
We strive to deliver a great product to your door with no hassle. We ensure this by employing our own quality control team that is on-site daily for both inspections and training to improve production methods, such as welding (even the robots need help sometimes!) and packaging. We also ensure our packaging is designed to survive the brutal beating it takes with UPS, so you’ll notice our boxes are reinforced and the parts within are further protected with internal packaging.
Our competitors that import often don’t spend the money for quality control, and our competitors who manufacture domestically often don’t spend the money for great packaging -- both of which lead to hassle for you as you try to get credit for damaged parts or new parts sent.
Ecosystem
A rack’s attachment ecosystem is one of the biggest reasons to choose one over another. Other companies that import typically do not have a dedicated engineering team to develop new products; they simply copy what already exists. If it’s patented, they can’t copy. For domestic manufacturers, they rely on high accessory prices to make up for a lower margin on the initial rack purchase, which means any new attachments cost an arm and a leg, while our global manufacturing advantage keeps costs lower.
Value
Value is subjective, but we’re at the sweet intersection of price and quality. Spend more, and it’s likely just for a name or very minor, nonfunctional details. Spend less and you’re likely rolling the dice or giving up future attachment development. Our attachments are also developed with value in mind, and that’s an area many people ignore, to their later regret. It’s not just the base cost of the rack to consider; it’s the full attachment ecosystem and what you expect future attachments to cost.
In the past, racks were hand-cut, hand-welded, and hand-painted. Today, it’s mostly robotics no matter where it’s made, except for smaller shops that can’t afford the robots or custom one-off production. The benefit of our scale is that we can employ the most modern manufacturing methods, including laser cutting, robotic welding, and robotic painting, resulting in a consistent, high-quality product."
https://repfitness.com/blogs/rep-blog/its-all-about-aesthetics,"It's All About Aesthetics -- But This Time We're Talking About Your Home Gym
Author: Aimee Heckel Published: 6/10/2022
It’s your gains cave. You can decorate it how you want to.
Beyond the obvious benefits of having a home gym (ahem, no equipment dripping with some random dude’s back sweat), another bonus is you can create whatever vibe you want. If you want to rock out to Disney music, crank up that Moana. If you want to string blinking party lights from wall to wall, no one’s going to stop you.
Build your ideal gym environment, while you’re building your own ideal body. Need some home gym inspo? Here’s where to start with designing an aesthetic home gym so you can always lift in style.
1. Pick a color.
Start by choosing the main color for your home gym. Basing this off the color of your power rack is a logical start. The PR-4000 and PR-5000 come in eight different colors: metallic black, matte black, red, blue, green, orange, white, or clear coat. The PR-1100 rack comes in four colors: metallic black, black, red, and blue.
Maybe you want a white rack with black accents, like a Stormtrooper. Or perhaps you want to just murder it out with black on black on black. Or maybe you want the full rainbow: a red rack, a green bench, blue battle ropes, and a full set of rainbow plates. Whatever mood you want to set starts with the color of your rack.
2. Get wild with patterns.
Turn your home gym into a force of nature with REP’s colorful Animal Print Plates. You’ve never seen bumper plates like this before: zebra, snake, giraffe, tiger, and leopard print. Mix and match different patterns, all of which fit on standard, 2” Olympic-style barbells. In addition to their unique design, these bumpers are extremely durable and high-quality, with a hooked steel insert.
The 10lb plates are made thicker than normal 10s to increase durability and reduce warping. Order Animal Print Bumpers in 10, 25, 35, 45, or 55lbs, or get the full set here.
3. Store with style.
REP offers a variety of wall- and rack-mounted storage options, but the most stylish is the Multi-Use Wall Storage rack, featuring laser-cut twin peaks inspired by the Rocky Mountains. This gorgeous seven-pronged storage hanger holds up to six barbells, or other equipment, like jump ropes, weight belts, chains, or mobility bands.
4. Embellish with banners.
Add some flava to your home gym with a banner (or multiple). REP offers 11 different banner designs – some are standard (like one that reads “REP Garage Gym”). Others are motivating: “No reason to be alive if you can’t do deadlift.” And a handful are pretty cheeky. Pick your favorite: “99 problems but a bench ain’t one,” “Lift, laugh, love,” or a totally ’80s “Let’s get physical” flag (that also features animal print – tying in those Animal Print Bumper Plates).
5. Pick your stickers.
Whether you want to decorate your water bottle (yes, there’s a matching REP water bottle), your power rack, your shelving, or your walls, stickers are always fun, inexpensive, and an easy addition. Pick between 14 different types of stickers, from a Rosie the Riveter-style skeleton proclaiming “Get fit or die trying,” to a buff bear insisting on “the right to bear arms.”
Express your love for Colorado (REP’s home base) with a sticker of the famous demon horse “Blucifer,” or further match your animal plates with the artist series sticker “Stay shredded,” showing a skeleton riding a tiger. Some stickers are holographic, others are metallic. But they’re all affordable, starting at 99 cents.
6. Go for adjustable – and colorful.
When selecting your gym bench, go for an ultra-versatile adjustable bench, like the AB-4100. Customize this bench by choosing one of seven different colors. There’s the standard metallic black, matte black, or red. But there’s also white, a unique army green, and stunning purple color.
If you love the clear coat look, the AB-5000 Zero Gap Adjustable Bench and the AB-5200 Adjustable Weight Bench also come with that sleek finish.
7. Don’t forget the finishing touches.
Put together a polished gym by adding these finishing touches:
- 3x4’ Floor Mats come in four different colors, with varying amounts of fleck, depending on your preference. These are made from high-quality rubber to protect your floors and equipment. They don’t absorb moisture, so they won’t grow bacteria, even if you sweat all over them.
- Organize your belt, knee sleeves, wrist wraps, and other bits and pieces in a black and white REP gym bag.
- Get something for your best lifting buddy: a “Gym Dog” collar for your biggest (four-legged) fan."

‘World’s Strongest Gay’ Competes in the World’s Strongest Man This Week
Rob Kearney has some big goals. Like earning a spot in the top 10 at this month’s World’s Strongest Man competition in California. It’s within reach, too; he was 11th the last time he competed.
But something else motivates him even more than even the boldest of athletic accomplishments.
Kearney is the first and only openly gay professional Strongman. And he wants to show the world that your sexual orientation won’t stop you from achieving greatness. In fact, it can be the fuel for greatness.
If you know Strongman, you know Rob Kearney, aka the “World’s Strongest Gay” on Instagram – and also the pound for pound strongest man, period. He’s a force to reckon with, especially under a yoke, with his bright rainbow mohawk and equally colorful clothes. Kearney publicly came out as gay in 2014, a year after he became a pro Strongman by winning the Amateur National Championships and shortly after taking second at America’s Strongest Man. Coming out was part of his journey of self-acceptance and self-realization, he says. “I was at a point in my life realizing I was just tired of waking up every single day putting on a façade to be somebody I wasn’t,” Kearney says. “I did what I felt was necessary for my overall happiness in my life, not just in my Strongman career.”
But it did affect his career in strength sports, too.
“I’m not just an athlete anymore,”
he says. “I have to be an advocate, as well -- sharing my point of view and experience with the world to help people understand what it’s like to be a gay man in strength sports.”
This message informed Strong, a book he just released in May. Strong is a children’s book inspired by Kearney’s life, using color as a metaphor for how much you can achieve when you accept yourself for who you are.
“I like to wear bright, colorful clothes, but when I started competing, I wore what everyone else wore,” he says. Finally, the main character in the book decides to wear all the vibrant colors that feel true to him – just like Kearney did in real life. And he competes. And wins.
“I’m hoping people understand strength is more than physical. Having inner strength is just as important as being physically strong,” Kearney says. And living an honest, true life freed up a ton of energy to enhance that internal strength that helped him level up as an athlete, he says.
The Journey to Strongman
Kearney wasn’t always an elite athlete. He says he started as “mediocre,” playing football and cheerleading in high school in Connecticut. Football is what led him to the weight room, which is where a teacher noticed he was pretty strong. That teacher also happened to be a CrossFit coach.
Encouraged by his teacher, Kearney began going to CrossFit classes at 5 a.m. before school. He loved the barbell lifts and strength challenges the most, and that snowballed into Kearney competing in his first Strongman competition his senior year. There was a teen division, but he went straight to compete with the big guys.
He got demolished.
But he fell in love with the sport.
Of course, he says, he enjoyed the physical tests of strength. He loved how every Strongman competition was different; that keeps the sport exciting. But what kept him coming back was the community.
“Strongman is one of the few sports that while you’re competing against somebody, you’re also cheering for them,” Kearney says.
He joined the weightlifting team at Springfield College in Massachusetts and continued competing in Strongman, working from the 200 pounds weight class up to heavyweight, which is where he competes today.
Thirteen years since his first Strongman comp and Kearney has competed in strength competitions around the world, including the World’s Strongest Man (since 2017), the Arnold Strongman Classic, and the Arnold Strongman Australia. He placed fifth at the 2022 Arnold. He took first place in the heavyweight class in 2016 Log Lift World Championships and was runner-up in 2019. He also held the national log lift record at 471lbs, despite being smaller than most Strongman athletes.
Strength sports are a long and slow journey without instant gratification, Kearney says. It’s easy to look at where he is today and only see the last few years of success. But it took him eight years of steady, relentless, patient work to finally get the needle moving.
And the demand for tenacity continues. After taking 11th in the World’s Strongest Man in 2019, he ruptured his triceps three weeks before the World’s Strongest Man 2020 and had to pull out. Then in 2021, again three weeks before worlds, he found out he had testicular cancer. After surgery, doctors are now monitoring his condition.
This year, he made it past that three-week-out mark with no unwelcome surprises. Third time’s the charm.
As Kearney gears up to fight for his spot in the top 10 at the World’s Strongest Man, he has to balance that with another mission. He’s a certified athletic trainer at a high school.
Full circle. This time, Kearney is on the other side of the story. He’s the role model in the weight room encouraging young athletes to pursue their own potential. And who knows? Maybe he’ll find the next big Strongman star under a barbell, just waiting for a push."

Hyrox Competitor Ryan Kent Makes Sled Pull World Record
It’s an hour-long grind. A brutal suck fest. The hardest challenge Ryan Kent can imagine.
Oh, how he loves it.
“I just love seeing what the human body is capable of,” says Kent, who competed in the Hyrox World Championships in Vegas on May 14. Kent came in second to the reigning champ, Hunter McIntyre. Along the way, Kent did make a new world record, though. He’s now the 2022 Hyrox Sled Pull World Champion, at 3:31. The loss was tough. Especially after Kent won the Hyrox North American Championship in January, beating out McIntyre for that title.
The second-place pedestal is fuel for Kent. Not that he needs extra motivation – he's been competing in athletic events since age 4. But he says he thrives under the pressure of being the underdog. (If you can even call being one of the top athletes in the world an “underdog.”) “That motivates me more than anything. Earning the respect of my competition has always been a huge motivator for me,” Kent says. “For me to perform my best, I need to not put myself up on some sort of pedestal.” It keeps him humble and grounded, he says. And going against the best of the best gives him a tangible goal to aim for.
Unlike Spartan Races (Kent was also a Spartan Pro Team Athlete and has finished on the Spartan podium more than 50 times), every Hyrox race is identical. You know exactly what to train (and therefore how to objectively measure your progress), and it must be executed in a specific way. Each competitor has their own judge at every station.
A Hyrox Race is comprised of five miles of running, but every half mile, the athletes stop to perform an exercise – in the same order every time: a 1,000-meter ski erg; 50-meter 400-pound sled push; a 50-meter 300-pound sled pull; 80-meter burpee broad jump; a 1,000-meter row; a 200-meter farmer carry with 70 pounds in each hand; a 100-meter walking lunge with a 70-pound sandbag; and finally, 100 wall balls with a 20-pound wall ball.
“It’s fun, but it’s seriously one of the hardest events I’ve ever done,” Kent says.
His personal record is 57:45, which at the time was the second fastest Hyrox time ever. The average athlete takes 90 minutes to two hours to complete the course.
Kent’s forte is the sled push and pull; those are two of his strongest stations that tend to give him an advantage. But his favorite station is the walking lunges. Ultimately, what makes or breaks a Hyrox race is your endurance, Kent says. “People underestimate how much volume they need to put into training to prepare,” he says. “Going to the gym for 30 to 45 minutes or going on a 45-minute run is not going to cut it in these comps. That’s where people make a mistake: They either don’t train enough intensity or long enough.”
This isn’t an ordinary strength competition. There are no breaks between events. And you need to be just as strong in your strength as your cardio. Luckily, that’s Kent’s preference. He says he loves trail runs as much as he loves lifting weights. “I was really drawn to something like this, because it tests the ultimate athlete. Not just the fastest or strongest, but a blend of both,” he says.
A Lifelong Athlete
Kent wasn’t ready for his first Hyrox competition three years ago. A friend told him about the race, and Kent hopped into a meet with minimal training. “I got my butt whooped, but I knew if I put in the right training, I could do really well,” Kent says.
That’s incidentally how Kent got into Spartan Races, too. He was out at a bar when I friend showed him a video of a Spartan Race. Kent signed up to compete a few weeks later – and got schooled.
“There’s a theme here,” he says with a laugh. “But I’m a stubborn person. I know I can be good at something if I devote the time and have a good training plan.”
And he was right. In 2015, he was named Spartan Race Rookie of the Year. By 2017, he got second place at the 2017 Spartan Race US Championships, fourth at nationals, and sixth at worlds. He earned third place at the Spartan Games in both 2020 and 2021. In addition, he also holds a DEKA FIT world record (the decathlon of functional fitness).
Sports have always been in Kent's blood. He grew up in an athletic household, with a dad who ran marathons. Kent ran his first 5K when he was 4 and his first half-marathon at 7. He competed in track and field and cross-country in the Junior Olympics, and he took his running all the way to college with a scholarship.
Today, Kent is the role model -- for his own 1-year-old son. Of all of Kent’s achievements, that’s what he’s most proud of: winning the North American championships in January while working fulltime as a delivery driver and being a new father. He woke up every morning at 4 a.m. to train before work. “I had to work harder than I’ve ever had to work in my entire life, and it paid off,” he says. “Winning that event was super rewarding, knowing the amount of focus and dedication I had to have. It was another level I didn’t even know I could do.”
Curious About Hyrox?
Want to try a Hyrox Race? Maybe don’t jump in unprepared. Kent suggests signing up with a friend or family member as a team. In a team, both competitors must complete the full run, but they can break up the stations in any way they want.
“The team race is a pretty cool component to the event and a great way to get your feet wet, because it’s a super hard race. It’s easy to just get out there and be halfway through and feel like you’re over it,” Kent says. “But if you’re out with a friend and the fatigue sets in, you have help.”"

Author: Aimee Heckel Published: 6/30/2022
In a world of straight barbells, these guys look different. Some are curvier or thicc. Some have handles or pads or all kinds of different grip angles that can look confusing to use – even if you’re not new to the gym.
But there are two things these specialty bars all have in common: 1. They all have metal, loadable sleeves you can stack weight plates onto; and 2. They’ll all help you get yoked as heck.
Here’s a closer look at seven popular specialty barbells: what they are, how to use them, and why you want to.
Safety Squat Bar
What it is: The Safety Squat Bar has cambered ends and handles that bring your hands in front of your body, rather than out to your sides like a straight barbell.
How to use it: Back squats are the most common use for a safety squat bar, but you can do a ton more: overhead presses, skull crushers, calf raises, you name it. Check out this article for more exercise ideas.
Why use it: Use it for a wide variety of exercises; a different challenge (it sits higher on your shoulders and the camber drops the weight below bar height); and comfort. It reduces stress on your elbows, shoulders, and wrists, making it great for people with limited shoulder mobility who find straight bar squatting uncomfortable. It helps squat form by improving your ability to remain upright, while also training your midline more. It can also help preserve your upper body strength on leg days.
Learn more about the Safety Squat Bar here.
Cambered Swiss Bar
What it is: The Swiss bar has a ladder-like design in the middle with angled rungs to create various grip options. REP’s Swiss bar also features a cambered design, and the outermost handle is set at a deficit.
How to use it: The Swiss bar is best known as a bench press accessory/alternative, but it can also be used for lat pull-downs, seal rows, ab rollouts, front squats, hammer curls, triceps extensions, and a ton more.
Why use it: It’s great for a wide variety of exercises and a greater range of motion due to the cambered design. Neutral-grip variations are gentler on the shoulders when benching. The arch also offsets the weight from your grip, creating a pendulum effect, so you must engage more muscles to stabilize the bar, creating a different stimulus than a traditional barbell.
Learn more about the Cambered Swiss Bar here.
Curl Bar
What it is: A Curl Bar, also called an EZ bar, features a bent shaft, weighs less than a standard barbell (30lbs), and is shorter (4’6” long).
How to use it: The Curl Bar is (go figure) specifically designed for biceps curls (from preacher curls to reverse curls), although you can also use it for skull crushers, overhead triceps extensions, and more. You could also use it for close grip chest presses or upright rows, although many people prefer to use the Curl Bar for exercises that target smaller muscle groups, like arms.
Why use it: The bent shaft reduces joint strain. The bends allow for a semi-supinated grip, which limits the stress on wrists and elbows.
Learn more about the Curl Bar here.
Rackable Curl Bar
What it is: This is like the Curl Bar (EZ bar) with a bent shaft, except it weighs more (35lbs) and is longer (6’2”) -- long enough to rack in a standard-width power rack.
How to use it: Use the Rackable Curl Bar in all the same ways as the standard Curl Bar. The ability to rack it makes it easier to load the sleeves with plates and more comfortable to get into position for your lifts.
Why use it: The semi-supinated grip limits stress on wrists and elbows, reducing common injury risk.
Learn more about the Rackable Curl Bar here.
Trap Bar
What it is: This hexagonal-shaped bar (also called a “hex bar”) allows for the equal distribution of weight around the body, instead of just in front like a regular deadlift. The bar features dual handles (standard and raised).
How to use it: It's typically used as a deadlift alternative. You can also use it for bent-over rows, frame carries, push-ups, Romanian deadlifts, and even kneeling shoulder presses, floor presses, and more.
Why use it: When used for trap bar deadlifts, the Trap Bar reduces stress and tension on the lumbar spine and can improve the efficiency and technique of deadlifts. It can also help people rehabbing from an injury or for lifters with a limited range of motion. The Trap Bar is more quad-dominant than conventional deadlifts, making it a great alternative for people who can’t do full-depth squats but still want a good quad workout from a compound movement.
Learn more about the Trap Bar here.
Axle Bar
What it is: An Axle Bar is thicker, shorter (5’ or 7’ long), and lighter (17lbs or 22lbs) than a standard barbell. It has no knurling and the sleeves do not rotate.
How to use it: The Axle Bar is a Strongman and grip sport staple. Use this in all the ways you would use a regular barbell, but it’s especially great for pulls.
Why use it: Added challenge. The thick, 2” diameter is harder to hold and can strengthen your wrists and grip. Grip strength is related to stronger forearms and shoulder stability. This can translate into improved lifts on a standard barbell (because after pulling a fat bar, the regular barbell will feel like cake). The thicker bar also eliminates bar whip, so when doing heavier deadlifts, you feel all the weight right off the floor.
Learn more about the Axle Bar here.
Farmer’s Walk Handles
What it is: Two barbells with elevated handles. Farmer’s handles allow you to do weighted carries, which are essential to a functional fitness program.
How to use it: Load the sleeves with plates, grab the handles, and pick them up. Keep your hands by your sides, your shoulders engaged, and back straight. It’s common to then walk a set distance with the weight. Tip: Short, fast steps are most effective. You can also do suitcase carries. Farmer’s walks are commonly seen in Strongman.
Why use it: Farmer’s carries improve your grip, endurance, and overall strength. They work a ton of muscles all at once, like legs, glutes, lats, traps, abs, and upper back – and they especially challenge core stability.

10 Pieces of Equipment to Add to Your Packing List
Eighty percent. That’s the percent of Americans who said they are planning to travel this summer, according to the Vacationer. That's also nearly the same percent of Americans who said they feel happier when they stick to a regular exercise routine.
You don’t have to pick just one. You can have your summer vaca – and stick to your health and fitness goals, too. Incorporate activity into your adventures. Walk instead of drive, explore on bikes, and look for hotels with fitness centers. But that may not always be possible (and sometimes, hotel gyms are treacherous). So, make sure you set yourself up for no excuses when you pack.
Here are 10 pieces of equipment to add to your packing list this summer:
1. Pull-Up Bands
You can wad these up in your extra shoes. They take up virtually no space and have a ton of resistance-training applications. And they don’t take up much space in your hotel room, either. Adjust the difficulty of your workout based on the thickness of the bands, or better yet, get the whole bundle so you can progressively challenge your muscles. They come in seven different sizes.
Just a few of the ways you can use bands for strength-training:
- Banded Squats
- Lat raises
- Romanian deadlift and regular deadlifts
- Tricep extensions
- Curls
- Shoulder press
Best of all: Bands are cheaper than a gym drop-in. Get a set of bands here for $6.99 (on sale from $9.99). And when you get home, you can use the bands for an extra challenge on compound lifts and to add resistance while weight training, as well as help you train your pull-ups.
2. Tube Resistance Bands with Handles
Use these bands in similar ways that you use Pull-Up Bands, except these have the added convenience of handles. This can be helpful for pulling and pressing options, especially when you’re really pushing
yourself. These come in three different resistance options (or get the full set) and are also super lightweight and compact. Throw them in your backpack or handbag.
Get a band with handles here for just $14.99.
3. Circle Hip Bands
Yeah, more bands. But these are different. They’re wider, not as long, and especially great for legs. Think: banded squats, lunges, clamshells, glute bridges, abductions. You’ve seen the videos on IG.
But all fitspo aside, resistance bands really do work. A 2019 National Library of Medicine study found resistance bands provided similar strength gains to using gym equipment. So, while they may not look like much, you can make them work for you. Tension is tension.
Never skip a leg day with Circle Hip Bands ($15.99), which come in three sizes. Or get the whole bundle. Your suitcase won’t even know they’re there.
4. Speed Cable Jump Rope
If you haven't done it since you were 8, here’s a reminder: Jumping rope is a killer cardio workout with a lot of additional benefits. It builds bone density and can improve agility, coordination, concentration, and explosive power, among other effects. Get a jump rope that doesn’t tangle during use or packing. At only 0.2lbs, you can stick it in your pocket and have a workout anywhere you go. Even in the airport. The other passengers will love that, for sure.
Play like a kid again with a Speed Cable Jump Rope for just $11.99.
5. Peanut Roller
Name something less comfortable than traveling. We’ll wait. (You can’t.) Don’t let an achy back or tight hammies from the torture of airplane seats get in the way of your gains. Pack a small, effective mobility device to help you not only recover from your on-the-go workouts, but also help you recover from being on the go.
The Peanut Roller is a smol guy – just 5” long. And its unique shape can reach areas around your spine, hips, and more -- spots other foam rollers can’t easily access. It’s easy to fit in your suitcase, and your body will thank you for bringing it. This is a healthy travel must-have.
Treat yo’ self right with a Peanut Roller for just $14.99.
6. Wood Gymnastic Rings
They’re compact and lightweight, and if you’re a CrossFit athlete or gymnast, you’ll be glad you threw them in your suitcase. Wood Gymnastic Rings are easy to set up indoors or outdoors. Just find something to loop them around, like a swing set at the playground, a strong tree branch, or the pull-up bar in the hotel gym. Pick between a 1.11” diameter (Olympic Federation specs) or 1.25” (more typical at CrossFit gyms).
Get in those ring muscle-ups while traveling for $34.99.
7. Ab Roller
If you’re headed on a road trip (more than 90 percent of people plan on it this year, according to Outdoorsy), this piece of equipment is easy to pop in your trunk – especially if having a strong core is high on your summer priority list. An Ab Roller targets your overall core, but it really demands full-body strength to do it right. Plus, it only weighs 2lbs.
Sharpen up your abs with the Ab Roller for just $10.
8. Ab Support Mat
If you don’t have space for an Ab Roller but still want to pack core-focused workout-on-the-go, the Ab Support Mat brings comfort, support, and efficiency. It’s smaller than a yoga mat and can easily squish in a suitcase. The high-density foam core allows your spine and hips to pivot optimally to engage your core muscles properly. And it’s comfortable – you could even sit on it on a long flight or ride or use it as a pillow.
Spoil your six-pack (or six-pack-to-be) with the Ab Support Mat for $19.99. It comes in three accent colors: red, blue, and pink.
9. Kettlebell
Got a long road trip ahead – and want to work with some real weight? You can get a legit, full-body workout with a kettlebell. Use it for deadlifts, goblet squats, lunges, push-presses, Turkish get-ups, triceps extensions, Russian twists, floor presses, rows, and of course kettlebell swings. Just about anything you can do with a dumbbell – and all kinds of stuff you can’t do with a dumbbell.
If you want varying weights, opt for an adjustable kettlebell, which comes in three different adjustable sizes: 8-16kg (tops out around 35lbs), 16-24kg (tops out around 53lbs), and 20-40lbs. Or if you know the best kettlebell weight for most of your exercises, Matte Kettlebells start at 5lbs and go up to 55lbs.
Get an Adjustable Kettlebell to put in your trunk starting at $149.99 here. Matte Kettlebells go for $19.99-$109.99.
10. REP Duffel Bag
OK, a gym bag isn’t technically workout equipment, but it’ll keep all your gear organized when you’re on the go. Pack it with your gym goodies when you’re home, and use it as a carry-on when you’re traveling. With an embroidered REP logo, this 18x10” black-and-white nylon duffel is super slick.
Travel in style with this $29.99 duffel bag."

Author: Aimee Heckel Published: 6/29/2022
A barbell is a barbell, right? Not exactly.
At first glance, all barbells look the same: long, silver, shiny. Throw some plates on the sides and lift. Simple.
But start playing around with the various barbells, and you’ll immediately notice huge variations. Some are longer, thinner, lighter. On some, the plates spin when you lift. Some hurt your hands a little bit more than others, and the knurling marks are in different places. The more you lift, the more you realize the importance of having the proper barbell for the exercise you want to tackle.
With so many different options, finding the perfect barbell can feel overwhelming – even for experienced lifters. So, here’s a quick and easy comparison of REP’s eight straight barbells and how to pick the best bar for you.
If you’re new to Olympic weightlifting: Technique Barbell
$129.99
Use: Olympic weightlifting technique training
Sleeves: Bushing
Knurl: Light/medium
Center Knurl: No
Markings: IPF and IWF
Weight Rating: 200lbs
The Technique Barbell is for (you guessed it) practicing your Oly technique. No PRs here; the max weight is just 200lbs. This bar is intended for training your form using light loads, making it great for beginners and children getting their start in lifting. The bar alone only weighs 15lbs (by comparison, a standard barbell weighs 45lbs) and is shorter too, at only 72”.
As a weightlifting bar, the Technique Barbell has light/medium knurling (not too much grip to be rough on your hands) and dual knurl markings both for powerlifting and weightlifting – so you could also use this to practice powerlifting lifts. It has no center knurling, ideal for high-volume training.
This barbell features bushing sleeves, which do allow for some rotation (which you want with Olympic lifts), but not as fast and smooth as a ball or needle bearing. In that, a bushing sleeve is more efficient for slower movements.
Learn more about the Technique Barbell here.
If you’re experienced in weightlifting: Gladiator Olympic Barbell
$349.99
Use: Olympic weightlifting, mixed-use
Sleeves: Needle bearing
Knurl: Medium knurl
Center Knurl: The 20kg bar has a center knurl. The 15kg bar does not.
Markings: IWF
Weight Rating: 1,500lbs
The Gladiator is an excellent bar for weightlifters ready to throw around some real weight. It’s designed for weightlifting, although it also works for mixed-use training, like CrossFit. It has a needle-bearing sleeve for the best, smoothest spin; medium knurl for grip support for higher-rep training; and IWF markings so you know where to put your hands. It can handle 1,500lbs.
The Gladiator comes in three different styles: 15kg, 20kg, or 20kg stainless steel. The non-stainless steel versions are covered in a hard chrome coating. The 20kg bars have center knurling, whereas the lighter bar does not. The lighter bar is also shorter (79.1”) than the 20kg, and it has a shorter sleeve length (12.6”) and smaller diameter (25mm).
The center knurl keeps the Gladiator consistent with IWF specifications. It can also help keep the bar in place on your back during squats.
Learn more about the Gladiator here.
If you’re new to powerlifting: Basic Barbell
$119.99
Use: Powerlifting
Sleeves: Bushing
Knurl: Medium
Center Knurl: Yes
Markings: General knurl markings
Weight Rating: 700lbs
New powerlifters and casual lifters, this bar’s for you. It’s got everything you need in an inexpensive, basic, 20kg power bar: medium knurling, center knurling to keep the bar in place during back squats, and a bushing sleeve with a bolt-on design to provide stability during your lifts. It’s great for lifters who want a quality bar but don’t need one with special features.
It features general knurl markings, although they’re not IPF specific for competitors. The 30mm diameter is thicker than a typical powerlifting barbell. The weight rating for the Basic Barbell tops out at 700lbs, so more experienced lifters will want to upgrade to a tougher bar. The chrome coating isn’t as high-end as stainless steel, but it will still help reduce rusting. As far as a budget bar, this one gets the job done well.
Learn more about the Basic Barbell here.
If you’re experienced with powerlifting: Stainless Steel Power Bar
$429.99
Use: Powerlifting
Sleeves: Bushing
Knurl: Medium
Center Knurl: Yes
Markings: IPF knurl markings
Weight Rating: 1,500lbs
More experienced and competitive powerlifters will want the Stainless Steel Power Bar. The medium knurl will help with grip, but it’s not too aggressive to affect higher-rep training and frequent use. IPF markings let you train on a competition-style barbell, and a weight rating of 1,500lbs means it’s tough enough for even the world’s strongest deadlifter.
The bushing design features snap rings, perfect for slower, strength-centric lifts. A huge bonus of this bar is it is end-to-end stainless steel and comes with a lifetime warranty – so you’ll be able to grow with this bar for years and years without worrying about rust and wear.
Learn more about the Stainless Steel Power Bar here.
If you’re an experienced powerlifter who wants deep knurling for deadlifts: Deep Knurl Stainless Steel Power Bar EX
$449.99
Use: Powerlifting
Sleeves: Bushing
Knurl: Deep
Center Knurl: Yes
Markings: IPF knurl markings
Weight Rating: 1,500lbs
REP doesn’t make a deadlift bar (yet!), but you don’t have to worry about this bar sliding out of your hands during your max deads. Its knurling is super deep and aggressive for max grip. As the most expensive powerlifting barbell, the Deep Knurl Stainless Steel Power Bar can do it all: It has the grip you want for deadlifts (cut 75% deeper than standard knurling) and a center knurl to prevent slipping during back squats. Plus, it’s fully stainless steel, on both the shaft and sleeves, the most rust-resistant option.
This bar also features IPF knurl markings so you can practice with precision for a competition. The bushing design is optimal for slower, strength-intensive lifts – of any strength. The weight rating is 1,500lbs.

If you want a basic mixed-use barbell: Sabre Barbell
$199.99
Use: Mixed-use
Sleeves: Ball bearing
Knurl: Medium
Center Knurl: Optional center knurling for the zinc 20kg bar
Markings: IPF and IWF
Weight Rating: 1,000lbs
Whether you do CrossFit, HIIT-style workouts, Olympic weightlifting, or powerlifting, this barbell is built for it all – and at an affordable price point, too. It’s got both IPF and IWF knurl markings. High-performance ball-bearing provide a smooth rotation. No-rib sleeves allow plates to slide on and off smoother.
The Sabre comes as both a 15kg (zinc finish, no center knurl) or 20kg (in zinc or black zinc). If you go with the 20kg zinc bar, you can choose center knurling or not. The black zinc option doesn’t have center knurling. The bar is built to handle 1,000lbs – so it’s the more basic choice for a mixed-use bar, but come on, a half a ton of weight isn’t exactly peanuts.
Learn more about the Sabre Barbell here.
If you want an upgraded, mixed-use barbell: Excalibur Barbell
$289
Use: Mixed-use
Sleeves: Hybrid
Knurl: Medium
Center Knurl: No
Markings: IPF/IWF
Weight Rating: 1,500lbs
For a little more money, the Excalibur reigns supreme – if you want a mixed-use barbell with no center knurl (your high reps will thank you). Also benefitting the higher reps: medium/deep knurling for your hands. Dual IPF and IWF knurl markings and unique hybrid bearing and bushing sleeves make this bar incredibly versatile.
With a little less spin than a pure bearing sleeve, the Excalibur is great for powerlifting exercises. Plus, the 29mm shaft diameter matches IPF standards. However, you can use the Excalibur for any barbell exercises: weightlifting, powerlifting, CrossFit, HIIT, you name it.
It can handle whatever you throw down, too, with the highest static rating of 1,500lbs. Choose a hard chrome coating or stainless steel for the 20kg bar. It also comes in a 15kg size. Another cool feature: Mild ribbing on the sleeves helps keep plates in place.
Learn more about the Excalibur here.
If you want an upgraded, mixed-use barbell that favors Olympic weightlifting: Gladiator MX
$359.99
Use: Olympic weightlifting, mixed-use
Sleeves: Needle bearing
Knurl: Medium knurl
Center Knurl: No
Markings: IWF
Weight Rating: 1,500lbs
Like the Gladiator, the Gladiator MX works for weightlifting and doubles up for mixed-use training. Both have needle-bearing sleeves; medium knurl; IWF markings; and are rated for 1,500lbs.
Here’s where the Gladiator MX differs. The Gladiator MX is slightly more expensive and only comes in 20kg. It is only available in a hard chrome coating. The MX has a lower tensile strength.
Whereas the Gladiator’s 20kg bars have center knurling, the MX’s 20kg has no center knurling. This is a bonus for high-volume training, snatches, and clean and jerks, when the bar rubs across your chest. However, a serious weightlifter may not like the MX and may find it more suitable for mixed-use. Compared with the Excalibur, the MX has a better spin and favors Olympic lifts, whereas the Excalibur is a mixed-use bar with a spin that favors powerlifting.

Author: Aimee Heckel Published: 6/29/2022
He’s not a kid anymore.
You probably know Dallin Pepper as the Fittest Teen on Earth. Not just once. An unprecedented three times. Now, he’s headed to the CrossFit Games – as an adult in the open division. And he says he’s coming for that title, too.
Dallin Pepper made a name for himself by becoming a three-time winner of the CrossFit Games Teens Division – ranking #1 in the world from 2017-2019. He earned the title the “Fittest Teen on Earth” in 2017 in the 14-15 age division and 2018-19 in the 16-17 age division. But that's just the beginning of his story.
Today, Pepper is 20 years old, married, and a full-time athlete who recently moved from Utah to Florida to live near his coach. In May, Pepper placed second in the Midatlantic CrossFit Challenge, one of four North American semifinals events. The top five men and women at the semifinals qualify for the CrossFit Games. This was Pepper’s first time qualifying as an adult.
“All of the American men’s fields are stacked. There are so many athletes who have been to the Games or right on the edge of qualifying,” he says. “It’s a really fun competition, but probably the most stressful, because the rest of your season is riding on the line.”
The 2022 CrossFit Games are in Madison, Wisconsin, Aug. 3-7. Pepper’s goal this year, as a rookie, is to take the top 10. He says it’s a lofty goal, but he believes it’s completely achievable. Next year: He’s going for a podium finish. His long-term goal: Just like his teen legacy, Pepper wants nothing less than to be #1 in the world.
“I’m here to win,” he says. “Not just participate.”
The Rise to CrossFit Fame
Pepper has been an athlete all his life. He played baseball, football, and basketball while growing up. When he was a high schooler, his parents got into CrossFit. Soon, they transformed their garage into a home gym and invited Pepper to workout with them. They thought it’d benefit his team sports. He thought the idea of working out “for fun” sounded dumb.
Then, in 2015, the CrossFit Games opened a teen division.
As soon as Pepper learned there was a competition involved, he changed his mind. He started training the next day. Six months later, at age 14, he joined a CrossFit gym and got a coach. The next year, he competed. He ranked 115th. Far from the podium. But instead of discouraging him, he used it as fuel.
“In my head, I just thought, ‘You’re 115th. You have so much work to do.’ I didn’t even consider quitting,” he says. “I knew if I stuck with it, I could for sure make it.”
And he did. One year later, Pepper rose from #115 to the best of the best. The Fittest Teen on Earth. A title he held strong until he aged out of it.
Training for the CrossFit Games
At age 18, Pepper graduated into the open division. In 2021, he didn’t qualify. He missed the top five by a couple points. Sixth place.
He couldn’t have that.
“I felt like I was 14 all over again. Everyone is extremely good at everything, and it’s so fast,” he says. “I took it as another challenge: ‘All right. Let’s start chipping away. We’ll get there. It’s just a matter of time.’”
He had to get serious. Burn it all down and go for it. So, he moved from Utah to live in Florida to train full-time with his coach, while doing a little school and online coaching on the side. It worked.
Now that he qualified for the Games, training is the #1 priority, he says. He trains six to eight hours a day (typically about 10 a.m.-2:30 p.m. and again 4-7p.m.). When he’s not training, he’s eating, sleeping, and recovering.
Yet ironically, he says what has changed since he was a teenager and what has propelled him forward as an adult is keeping CrossFit in perspective.
“CrossFit is something I do. It’s not who I am. At the end of the day, we’re just working out,” he says. “I understand the importance of other things in my life. And that has actually helped me take CrossFit more seriously.”
Looking back, he agrees with his parents: CrossFit is great for teenagers and will make you a better athlete in other sports, he says. He encourages other young athletes to stay patient and enjoy the process. And above all, learn how to move well.
“That will set you apart from other teenagers. When people rush and don’t learn how to properly perform movements, that sets you up for injury. Half the battle is going into competition as healthy as possible, because we put our bodies through a lot,” he says. “You recover so quickly as a teenager that you sometimes just go for it and don’t realize what you’re doing.”
Train for the long haul, and you’ll get farther, he says.
Another big key to his success: focusing on the little wins. To Pepper, CrossFit is as much a mental game as a physical one.
“Unlike football, where you can overpower someone physically, with CrossFit, you have to overpower them mentally, sometimes by beating them physically,” he says. “It’s more of a mental game. I enjoy that a lot.”"

Author: Aimee Heckel Published: 6/30/2022
Can She Break Top 5 for her 5th CrossFit Games?
Amanda Barnhart’s not new to the pressure. It’s her fifth time qualifying for the CrossFit Games, with three consecutive top-10 finishes.
This year, she’s bringing the fire. She’s aiming to break the top five.
She’s putting in the work to get there, too – training everything and anything that could come up in the August competition. Swimming, biking, running, lifting odd objects, climbing, gymnastics, handstand walks, you name it.
“Making sure you get touches on all of the weird stuff is important,” she says. “And everyone’s still hammering out the biggest holes they can fill. For me, that’s upper body – pulling – and running.”
The fittest athletes show up at the end, she says. So she’s working hard full-time to get as fit as possible, while managing nutrition and recovery. “I’m packing it all in. I’ve had to tell people, ‘I’m sorry. I’m just a shell of myself for the next eight weeks,’” Barnhart says. “You’re so tired, all you can do is eat, sleep, and workout.”
That’s far from a complaint, though. Barnhart loves every second of it. And the hardest days are her favorite. The hard days point to opportunities for improvement. That drives her.
“I think about how I want to feel at the Games. I remember the moments I was last place or broke down in a workout. I remember how painful those moments were,” she says. “I don’t want to feel like that again. So I do everything I can to avoid those moments.”
Pushing the Limits
One half love of the game. One half growth through the pain. That’s what motivates one of the world’s top female CrossFit athletes.
In CrossFit Open, Barnhart is currently ranked 20th in the world and 10th in the United States. In addition to being a professional CrossFit athlete, Barnhart has a doctorate degree in physical therapy. Competition runs through her blood; she swam Division 1 in college at Cleveland State, played sports in high school, and was a gymnast for 10 years. In college, she started CrossFit to help with swimming.
As much as she loves CrossFit, Barnhart says she considers team sports just as important, especially for young athletes.
“CrossFit is a great exercise tool, but I like to encourage people to stay in sports,” she says. “Do sports with your friends, feel the camaraderie of a team, play a sport in college. Do CrossFit after that. There's a whole world of sports out there that kids are missing out on because they just want to be in the Games.”
She didn’t begin competing in CrossFit until after she graduated from PT school. Other sports helped shape her perspective on how to approach a physical challenge.
“You get to a point in the workout where it hurts. You’re wanting to quit. And you manage to push through that point. It feels so good to go to those limits,” Barnhart says.
In CrossFit, those limits are moving targets; things are always changing. As soon as you get good at one skill, she says, there’s something else to work on. “It’s cool to see the progress – to look back and remember when you thought something would never be possible, and now you’re doing it,” she says.
In fact, those growth moments are her proudest accomplishments. Not the easy wins. The comebacks. When she didn’t climb the pegboard in 2018 but came back the next year and climbed it five times. The time she got last place in muscle-ups. The next year, after tons of practice (150 muscle-ups a week for four months), she landed in the top-10 for muscle-ups.
“To feel the hard work pay off, that’s the most satisfying. Other people don’t even notice those moments, but the people in your circle know,” Barnhart says. “On the leaderboard, it’s not a win, but for me, those moments mean a lot more than getting first in a workout I knew I was going to crush.”
Now in her fifth year competing in the Games, Barnhart says she’s focusing on consistency across the board in all the workouts, rather than aiming for a few big wins in a meet. The bigger picture.
“I’ve been an athlete that can win workouts and then be in the bottom half in another workout,” she says. At the semifinals, she says her goal was to just have a consistent weekend. And it worked. She’s taking that approach to the big meet, too.
“I have no control over how fit other athletes will be, what the workouts are, how hot it’ll be,” Barnhart says. “Instead, I want to focus on every little thing I can do to do my best.”"

Turns out, there may be a fountain of youth after all. But it’s not water.
IT'S IRON.
A 2021 study recently released by the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that strength-training may lower your risk of death — a lot. Just 30 minutes to one hour of strength-training per week can reduce your mortality risk by up to 20 percent, according to the study. And that’s just the beginning of the health benefits that research finds.The recent study found that muscle-building exercises reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease and lung cancer, and it reduces your chance of developing diabetes. Strength-training helps preserve your skeletal muscle mass, which plays a role in glucose metabolism. Glucose metabolism essentially feeds your cells, supplying energy and nourishment to them. It’s kind of a big deal in that it’s the basis for life.
Strength-training isn’t just limited to slinging iron, though. It also includes bodyweight exercises, like push-ups and sit-ups, and exercises with specialized equipment, like resistance bands. While ultimately, the recent research does have its limitations, so more analysis is needed, similar findings have been echoed in other studies. One study published on ScienceDirect found strength-training was “significantly” associated with decreased overall mortality in older adults. Specifically, they had lower odds of cancer and cardiac death than less-active adults. Another study published in the National Library of Medicine concluded that resistance training was associated with lower mortality and was especially beneficial when combined with aerobic exercise.
Other health benefits of strength-training
Beyond reducing your mortality risk factors, Medical News Today reports strength-training reduces the risk of osteoporosis and osteoarthritis among the older population. A study titled “Resistance Training is Medicine” found that resistance training may increase resting metabolic rate, reduce fat, improve cognitive abilities, reduce resting blood pressure, reduce lower back pain, ease pain from arthritis and fibromyalgia and more. The list goes on.
Exercise is also beneficial for your mental health and has been shown to reduce anxiety and depression and improve cognitive function and self-esteem. Harvard Medical School found the same thing a few years ago: People who did weight training two or more days a week saw“significant” reductions in their symptoms of depression. Untreated depression can lead to suicidal attempts and thoughts.The results are clear: Picking up heavy circles and putting them back down is important for your physical and mental health.
So, how much do you need to lift, bro?
Exactly how much you need to work out to see health benefits varies slightly by experts. Whereas the recent study in the British Journal recommends strength-training once a week, the Department of Health and Human Services recommends two days per week. It also recommends 2.5 to 5 hours of moderate-level aerobic activity or 1.25 to 2.5 hours of vigorous aerobic activity per week. The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and the Mayo Clinic echo that. They both recommend muscle-building exercises at least twice per week. Of course, that amount may be higher if you have specific health and fitness goals, the Mayo Clinic says. But ultimately, just get up and get moving. Even small amounts of activity add up, says the clinic.
Work on building strength and cardio health, and your body will keep working with you — for you. Exercise is a fun (and evidence-based) way to add more days to the calendar of your life."
https://repfitness.com/blogs/rep-blog/what-s-the-difference-between-a-ladder-style-and-pin-style-bench,"What’s the Difference Between a Ladder-Style and Pin-Style Bench?
Author: Aimee Heckel Published: 6/29/2022
An adjustable bench – one that you can move up and down to hit different angles – is a staple in a solid home gym. But exactly how you adjust those angles depends on the type of adjustment mechanism.
The two most common styles of adjustment mechanisms on adjustable benches are ladders and pop-pins. Here’s a quick look at the difference between them.
Ladder-Style Adjustment Bench
You can identify a ladder mechanism immediately by just looking at it – it looks like a ladder, with multiple grooves cut into the steel on the frame.
A ladder is incredibly fast, convenient, and simple to use, and it’s easy enough to adjust with just one hand, with barely any effort (although you may need to use both hands when moving to a lower setting). You can switch angles in seconds. Lift the back (or seat) pad up, move it to the desired angle, and voila, it typically falls right into place. Just make sure the horizontal bar is securely set in the ladder grooves before you put your bodyweight on it.
Some adjustable benches feature a “closed ladder system.” This design keeps the ladder securely in place when adjusting the bench and prevents you from lifting the ladder out when adjusting angles. It is also required for the vertical storage of a ladder-style bench.
Ladder-style adjustable benches: AB-4100, AB-3000, AB-3100, AB-5200.
Closed ladder designs: AB-4100, AB-5200.
Pop-Pin Adjustment Benches
A pin-style bench features a little knob-like pop-pin underneath the back (or seat) pad. These benches typically have a curved spine lined with holes corresponding to different degrees.
These benches are also easy to use, although they are not as quick and effortless as a ladder. Simply pull the pin out of its current hole, move the pad to the desired angle, and let go of the pop-pin so it locks into the new hole. The term “pop-pin” refers to the pin being spring-loaded. These can be a little finicky to pull out (they may require a little wiggling), but they do help assure the pin securely pops back into position.
Pop-pins also ensure the pad is locked in place both up and down, and they also allow you to vertically store the bench. The pop-pins are attached to the bench, so you don’t have to worry about losing them."

The Safety Squat Bar is a specialty barbell with cambered ends and handles that bring your hands in front of your body, rather than out to your sides like a straight barbell.
It looks hardcore. Like part of some kind of sci-fi Viking robot warrior. And in some ways, the SSB is extra challenging. It sits higher on your shoulders, forcing you to fight to stay upright instead of crumbling forward like a sad taco. Add to that ends that drop the weight below bar height, and you’ve got a totally different breed of squats. Brutal and humbling. Not necessarily harder or easier than traditional back squats, but indisputably different. You’ll probably have to drop weight.
But in other ways, this specialty bar is pretty forgiving. It massively reduces the stress on your upper body, in particular your elbows, shoulders, and wrists. There’s a reason — a ton of reasons, actually — why the SSB is a beloved (and sometimes lovingly despised) exercise among lifters, from Strongmen to powerlifters to gym rats who want to improve their squats (or keep hitting legs with fewer demands on the upper body).
Here’s why you need to add a Safety Squat Bar to your training — and all the different ways you can use it. Hint: It’s way more than just back squats that make you look like a cyborg.
WHY USE AN SSB?
Due to its unique shape, the SSB (also called a Safety Squat Yoke Barbell) can help you gain strength, relieve upper body discomfort or pain, prevent injury, improve your squat form, preserve your upper body strength, and more. Here’s how:
- Strength: With the bar pitching you forward and higher on your shoulders, you are forced to really engage your core and upper back. Because of that, SSB squats have a vertical position that looks more like a front or high-bar squat. As such, SSB back squats tend to really fire up the quads, as well as minimize the pressure on the lower back. The more upright your torso, the less stress on your lower back. The bar demands your quads step in. This position can also allow more range of motion through the lower-body joints (and make it easier to hit depth). Different exercises with the SSB will hit different muscle groups (see next section).
- Relieve upper body pain: Holding handles in front of your body takes a ton of strain off your shoulders, elbows, and wrists; you don’t need to externally rotate your shoulders with this bar. It can also allow you to keep squatting with a pec injury. Even if you’re not injured, the SSB can help you squat with reduced shoulder and chest mobility, while you work on improving your range of motion.
- Injury/pain prevention: Feeling elbow tendinitis creeping in? Swap to the SSB while you rest it. Plus, the bar pad wraps around your neck, so the metal doesn’t dig into your spine/neck.
- Technique: The SSB can improve your ability to remain upright under a traditional barbell and help you train not to let your chest collapse. Because the SSB places the bar load on your center of gravity, it’s easier to maintain proper form during the squat. This muscle awareness and memory translates to a straight bar.
- Preserve upper body: This bar gives your upper body a break, preserving your shoulders and chest and allowing them to properly recover for your next upper body day. Save your shoulders for OHPs or heavy bench. Don’t waste them on squats.
HOW TO USE AN SSB?
Although back squats are the most obvious use of the SSB, that’s just the beginning of how you can use it. Especially with a SSB with removable handles. Here are some other exercises to try:
- Good mornings/seated good mornings/single-leg good mornings/upper back good mornings
- Hatfield squats. Yes, you can let go of the handles and it will still balance on your traps.
- Front squats. The pad and handles make these more comfortable than front squats with a straight bar and even make front squats possible for people with wrist issues.
- Box squats
- Bulgarian split squats
- Step-ups
- Single-leg Romanian deadlifts
- Calf raises
- Zercher squats
- Lunges/walking lunges. Using a bar for lunges doesn’t limit the weight to your grip strength. And if you let go of the SSB for a moment to catch your balance, the SSB will remain in place, whereas you must keep both hands on a straight bar at all times to keep it from rolling off.
- Hip thrusts/glute bridges
- Overhead press. Bonus: If you have a low ceiling, the camber puts the weight lower than the center part that you grip, so you have more clearance for plates on the barbell. Remove the handles so you don’t worry about hitting your face or head on them and can maintain a proper bar path.
- Triceps press/JM Press. Remove the handles to keep them out of the way.
- Skull crusher
- Shrugs
- Side bends
The list of exercises goes on and is mostly limited by your creativity, making the Safety Squat Bar an incredibly useful, versatile, and fun new challenge to add to your home gym.
