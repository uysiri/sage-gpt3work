1,https://getpavr.com/3-tips-to-organize-your-to-do-list/,"Does your to-do list feel like it only gets longer as the week goes on? Here are 3 quick tips to help you better organize your to-do list so you can finally start crossing things off and, hopefully, end your week with clear accomplishment.
Step 1: Brain Sweep
Get everything out of your brain and onto a piece of paper or a digital document so you can begin to sort through it. Don’t leave anything out – personal tasks should get written down as well.
The problem with not writing down everything you think you have to do is that you’ll inevitably either forget about it, or get distracted by it when you’re working on something else. So go ahead and spend 15 minutes listing out every single thing you think you need to do.
Keep this somewhere easily accessible so you can quickly add to it when something else pops up.
Step 2: Break it Down
Now that we’ve got it into a format we can sort through, it’s time to identify the priority of each task. Before you prioritize it, ask yourself:
Is this something I can delegate? Maybe there’s someone on your team that could take this task off your plate. Remember: done is better than perfect, and it’s okay to trust someone else to help – especially if you’re feeling overwhelmed.
1. Is this something I can automate? It may seem like it will take longer to automate a task than to actually do the task, which may be true, but remember that once it’s automated you won’t have to do it again, or, at the very least, it will greatly reduce the amount of time it takes to complete. Check out Zapier if you’re looking for a simple way to begin automating your workflow.
2. Is this something I should outsource? Is there someone better suited than you to complete this task? Consider outsourcing the things that either aren’t in your wheelhouse or aren’t worth your time.
3. Finally, can I eliminate this? Is it really a task you need to complete, or just something you think you need to complete? Is it going to directly affect your bottom line or move you forward in any capacity? Did you say yes to something when you should have said no? Don’t add things to your list just for the sake of adding things to your list – really evaluate if what you’re spending time on is worth your time. Time is finite – don’t waste it on meaningless tasks.
Once you’ve gone through each task with this lens of questioning, it’s time to prioritize. The Eisenhower method is a great way to determine the level of priority and urgency required to complete.
Step 3: Make Time
Making time to actually work through the tasks on your to-do list is probably the most overlooked, yet most important, step to actually completing your list. Go ahead and block time off on your calendar to work on your tasks. You’ll be surprised how much you can cross off during focused work. It’s important to treat that blocked off time just like you would any other important meeting or event on your calendar, though – meaning you don’t cancel and you don’t reschedule unless absolutely necessary.
Bonus tip: If you’re using Pav*r, be sure to Categorize and Label your blocked off time so you can run effective reports to see exactly how and where you’re spending your time. You might find that many of your tasks are taking you either more or less time than what you had anticipated and you’ll be prepared to make data-backed decisions based on what you learn."
2,https://getpavr.com/3-ways-productivity-apps-are-making-us-less-productive/,"Productivity is a buzz word that’s been thrown around so much in the last few years that it’s almost lost its meaning.
Get up early, go to bed late, and cram as much as you possibly can into those hours in between.
Then brag about it.
Them: “Hey! How have you been?”
You: “Good! SO BUSY!”
When did busy become a badge of honor?
Shouldn’t being more productive mean we actually have more time to do…well, nothing? Or at least something we want to do and not something we need to do?
We became so obsessed with being productive that we forgot why we were trying to get more done in less time.
More time = freedom.
If you’re just cramming that free time with more work, you might be missing the point.
But don’t blame yourself. It’s easy to get caught up in hustle culture and believe that your value is somehow attached to your productivity. Especially when there’s literally thousands of apps developed to help you be more productive.
Need help managing your to-do list? There’s an app for that.
Need help managing your inbox? There’s an app for that.
Need help managing your calendar? There’s an app for that.
Need help managing your communication? There’s an app for that.
“There’s an app for that” is a phrase we may have taken a bit too literally. Just because there is an app for that, doesn’t mean we necessarily need to use that app.
There are thousands of apps meant to help you increase your productivity, but studies show that productivity apps are actually killing productivity.
How, exactly?
Glad you asked.
Productivity Killer #1: App Fatigue
A study of nearly 5 million work hours discovered that, on average, teams use 35 apps and switch between them more than 1100 times per day. The context switching alone is a massive productivity killer that can easily eat up hundreds of hours every year.
Maybe you’re thinking, “there’s no way I use 35 apps a day”, and maybe you’re right. But do you know exactly how many you’re using? Count them and you’ll probably be surprised by the number.
The next time you download an app, ask yourself, “is this worth the amount of effort it’s going to take to set the app up, learn how to use, and use consistently?”.
Productivity Killer #2: Data Duplication
The same study shows that employees are performing 134 copy-paste actions per day in the transfer of information from one app to the other.
Assuming it only takes 5 seconds to copy/paste, that’s still a massive 46 hours lost every single year to data duplication. And that’s just for one person! Multiply that by a team as small as 10 and your company has lost 460 hours to a function as seemingly simple as copy/paste.
Before you hit download on the next app, ask if it will integrate with your existing apps to allow the transfer of data.
Productivity Killer #3: Information Searching
With so many apps, it’s nearly impossible to keep track of where everything lives, especially if you don’t need to access it on a daily basis. This study by Cornell University indicates that searching for information between various apps can waste as much as nearly an hour every single day.
Again, while that may not seem like a lot at first glance, multiply that by 200 work days a year multiplied by 10 employees and you’ve lost more than 2,000 work hours.
Does all of this mean you shouldn’t be using productivity apps? Absolutely not. There is real value in apps that make our lives easier and more productive. But maybe we don’t need all of them.
I can’t tell you how many apps you need, that’s up to you and the needs of your business, but what I can tell you is to be more intentional about the apps you choose. Make sure they’re solving a real problem and, if possible, that they integrate with your other apps to eliminate the need for a transfer of information.
Less really can be more in this scenario, which is exactly why we created Pav*r as an add-on to your Google Calendar. We know that so many of you are already heavy calendar users and we just want to make that experience better by providing you a way to not only collect additional information from your calendar entries, but actually get it out of the calendar and into a useable Google Sheet where you can analyze that information and make better, more informed decisions, about what to do with it.
We can’t create more hours in the day, but we can decide how to use those hours."

The Intentional Calendar Mapping Method
⏳ Have you ever wished for more hours in a day?
😰 Do you feel like you’re constantly trying to catch up and never ahead?
📝 Does your to-do list only get longer even though you know you’re crossing things off?
😵💫 Are you overwhelmed by things you think you should do with no idea where to even start?
Give me 30 minutes for 3 days, and I’ll
give you a way to work less and live more.
Imagine what your life could be like if you:
🗓 Had a schedule that allowed you both freedom and success
💰 Worked less hours and made more money
🏖 Could take a vacation that didn’t include constantly checking your phone for missed calls or emails
🤗 Had time for those things you’d moved into the “maybe one day” pile
Join our FREE 3-day Challenge and I’ll teach you exactly how to go from overwhelmed to in control and thriving.
I’ll be popping into your inbox each day of the challenge with a short video and homework for you to complete.
I know you’re already busy, so I promise to keep it short — you’ll be able to watch the video and complete your homework in less than 30-minutes each day.
Hey, I’m Jessica. I completely understand that feeling of overwhelm. I was a small business owner myself. I started my own business because I thought I’d have freedom (and money), but several years into that business I had nothing but a constant stress headache and a stack of past-due bills.
It took some painful self reflection, but I finally realized that my problem wasn’t a lack of clients or a lack of trying, it was a lack of intention.
I was just out here doing any and everything, hoping that *something* would just stick.
By the time I realized that strategy was failing me miserably, it was almost too late. But then I made a decision that changed everything. A decision to be intentional with my time. I committed to stop wasting one single minute on anything that wasn’t going to move my business or myself forward towards my goals.
My life was so impacted by this decision to be intentional with my time that it set me on a whole different career path. I took my passion for time management and turned it into an app, Pav*r (pronounced paver), that I’m now proud to share with the world because I know the positive impact being totally in control of your time can make and I wanted your journey to be easier than mine.
Along with the app, I’m sharing the Intentional Calendar Mapping Method that I used to form my own intentional time habits. If you can commit 30-minutes a day for just 3 days, I can guarantee that you’ll finally start experiencing the freedom you thought entrepreneurship would bring by being completely in control of the hours in your day.

10,https://getpavr.com/effective-time-blocking-techniques-for-google-calendar/,"Do you feel like your day is spinning out of control? A day is only 24 hours, and there is so much to squeeze in!
Doesn’t it feel like our lives have more demands on them than ever before? That’s why it is so important to get organized, and one of the best ways to schedule and organize is to utilize Google calendar time blocking.
For a small business, time blocking is critical for you and your employees.
What Is Google Calendar Time blocking?
Time blocking with Google calendar is a fantastic tool that helps you to manage your time most effectively.
Calendar blocking involves adding specific times to your google calendar that are set aside for specific jobs or tasks to be completed in.
Time blocking helps you to focus. It holds you accountable.
Why Should You Use Google Calendar Time Blocking?
Time blocking keeps your day on track. We all need that, right?
Google calendar time blocking helps you to focus. It holds you accountable for your time, and it helps you to improve your time management by allotting blocks of time to complete tasks.
When you’ve taken your calendar and divided it into blocks of time, you become task-focused. This helps to limit other tasks or people from infringing on your time – goodbye, distraction!
Using a weekly time blocking template or a daily time blocking template can allow you to start your day or week with a purpose and end goal.
Benefits of Time Blocking:
- Quality of your work improves: When a specific time is set aside for a task, your distractions are removed, allowing you to hyper focus and give forth your best quality work.
- Time is saved: When your schedule is clearly laid out, time isn’t “lost” or wasted. Every moment is utilized.
- Motivation vs. Distraction: Having a clearly organized day keeps you motivated. You won’t find yourself distracted with wondering what to do next. It’s all nicely organized.
How To Use Google Calendar For Time Blocking
Like everything in life, there is a learning curve to time blocking. However the benefits and the gift of sanity in your day are immeasurable.
Here are some tips:
- First, identify your tasks. What exactly are your tasks to complete? Do you have tasks that repeat? For example, in a small business, you may have set weekly meetings, follow-ups with your clients, or management and team meetings. Use the Google calendar “repeat event on specific days” feature for these types of events.
- Identify your smaller tasks: Do you have a set phone call or a dentist appointment? Need some personal time? Those smaller tasks, or to-do list items, take time too, so make sure you create space to complete them.
- Sort your tasks into categories: Once your tasks for the week are identified, categorize them on your calendar. You can do this with color-coded categories in Pav*r.
- Prioritize: When time blocking your google calendar, be sure to create a system that identifies tasks that are important or urgent. In addition to that, no one knows your energy level better than yourself. Are you most focused in the morning? Schedule blocks according to times that are best suited to you.
- In and Out: Be sure to remember when you are blocking out time on google calendar to create blocks of time that are “google calendar focus time” for deep work, and also set “out of office” blocks.
Adding Your Time Blocks
The addition of time blocks to your calendar is super easy. When adding time blocks, you want to keep things simple and clear.
- Label Clearly: Take the guesswork out of what you should be working on by clearly identifying the task at hand. Keep your info short and clear.
- Add Descriptions: Within the time block, add a clear description with important details you might have to otherwise look up.
- Add Directions/Location:. If you have to travel for a meeting or event, be sure to add the location so you can quickly access directions from your phone’s map.
- Links: Add any and all links that are needed. This could include Zoom links, Google Meet link, calendar Slack integration links, important website links for research, etc.
- Color Coding: There is nothing as clear as color coding. The calendar time blocking template add-on, Pav*r , can help expedite this process and generate reports about how much time you’re spending on each category within a given time frame.
- Keep A Record: One of the greatest things about time blocking is that you can always access your Google calendar history as a reference. Just simply search Google calendar to find out how you handled an event in past months, etc. Pav*r has a feature that allows you to easily download this info into a spreadsheet where you can create custom reports about how you, and your team, spent your time – super helpful!
Don’t forget to utilize the “find a time” google calendar feature to assist you in your scheduling of blocks.

You can do this! Go ahead and get organized by using your Google calendar!
Pav*r can help you by transforming your calendar into a beautiful, and usable tool towards efficiency.

13,https://getpavr.com/google-calendar-appointment-slots/,"Time is valuable.
Successful people tend to be very organized individuals that create office/working hours that are an effective use of their time.
One of the most efficient ways to create a weekly schedule is to set aside specific hours for appointment slots that you intend to be used for your weekly team meetings, client hours, student meetings, and more.
The Google calendar appointment slot feature is a fabulous tool for delegating your time.
Why Should You Use Google Calendar Appointment Slots?
There are many benefits to using the appointment slots within your Google calendar, and there are many reasons for using this feature.
Some examples for using appointment slots:
- A professor can create seamless office hours that their students can sign up for online.
- For colleagues and team members, setting up an appointment to meet with each other is easy.
- Service providers can add available times to their calendar on their website, allowing clients and customers to schedule a time.
Creating appointment slots is very helpful for keeping your schedule organized – for your own benefit. Slots are a wonderful and convenient way for you to allow others to know your exact time availability. They allow you to show clearly when you are, or are not, available.
It’s a simple set-up. You choose a block of time that you want to make yourself available on your calendar. Then, your clients and coworkers can choose a time within that given time frame. For example, you could make yourself clear from 2-4PM and allow guests to book a 30 minutes slot with you.
This is especially helpful for allowing for productivity. If you know that you prefer to only have meetings in the am, then you can create that availability on your Google calendar. You choose when you want to have meetings, based on what works best for you.
It is also helpful for creating a work/life balance – so important these days. Create neatly organized times for appointments that allow you to reserve time for yourself (lunch, workout, family responsibilities, time free, etc)
The time slots that are booked will appear on your calendar right away, so you will always easily see and know who you are meeting with, exactly when, and for how long.
How Do I Create Appointment Slots on Google Calendar?
It is really quite simple to turn blocks of time on your Google calendar into your available appointment slots. Others can book times within these slots.
How to create appointment slots in google calendar:
- First, go ahead and open your Google Calendar.
- Select the specific calendar that you wish to create time slots in.
- Click on any empty time slot that you’d like to make available.
- See and click Appointment slots.
- Add your chosen title for the slot.
- Choose the date and time.
- Select the number of slots and the duration you’d like for each appointment.
- Add more details if desired to your appointment slot by clicking More Options – and add that information.
- Click Save.
When a person chooses a time slot within your given availability, their appointment will appear as an event that overlaps the block, leaving you with a nice and organized schedule.
How to cancel meeting in Google calendar
Canceling an appointment is very easy.
Here are the steps:
- Open your desired Google calendar.
- Click on the appointment that you want to cancel.
- In the pop up, click on the trash can icon.

16,https://getpavr.com/how-context-switching-is-killing-your-productivity/,"Have you ever heard the phrase context switching?
You may not have heard the phrase, but most likely you are guilty of doing it!
Do you often feel like you are doing too many things at once?
What exactly is context switching?
Context switching is the act in which a person hops between different kinds of tasks while managing work. That can include using apps, social media sites, devices, or projects.
It’s perfectly normal to switch context. We all do it! However, when we spend a lot of time jumping between different tasks, we lose our focus, and lose out on the beauty of deep work.
Context switching eats up our time – it can cause low productivity at work, because productive time is lost to all of this distraction. We can find ourselves overwhelmed, unable to organize projects – and in turn, more stressed-out.
Context switching is one of the factors that affect productivity.
The Problem of Context Switching
Do you find that your days and nights are filled with visiting different apps? Are you busy with multiple project management?
Slack, Email, Google meets, Zoom, Notion, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Microsoft Word, task lists and more are wreaking havoc on our schedules.
It’s all just SO many portals to bounce around, entering and exiting. What happened to our attention span, right? It’s exhausting!
Context switching can:
Low productivity
Increased fatigue
Lost time and value
- Difficulty tracking multiple projects
Lead to personal burnout and drain
Switching around while trying to manage multiple projects kills our energy and depletes mental focus. This lowers our cognitive performance.
Is context switching the same as multitasking? Not exactly. Let’s break it down.
Context Switching versus Multitasking
Context switching is not multitasking, though most of us think it is. They can both have a negative impact.
What is context switching? Context switching is a situation where an individual is quickly moving between lots of different tasks and different items. The switching occurs when you are still in the middle of the current task. Often the initial task is left incomplete.
Then, what is multitasking? Multitasking is a situation where an individual is working on multiple projects simultaneously. The quality of the work can be affected, but all may be completed.
So how can we combat this jump task life? Pav*r takes a deep dive into solutions.
Combating Context Switching
The tools and technologies that we think are going to make our work day easier or faster, actually leave us disconnected. The cost of context switching is huge.
So, how can we fix this? Aren’t we all guilty of doing multiple things at once?
One way is to setting time blocking on our Google calendars with the Pav*r add on.
Here are some simple mind-shifts to give your day some structure:
1. Do not disturb: Utilize the do not disturb modes or calendar blocks for creating uninterrupted focused work. Many things affect productivity including time that is free from distractions. Combat the switch-cost effect.
2. Collaborate: Make the most of your teamwork on your Google calendar by creating team group calendars. This can allow you to easily divide up tasks and to find time to work together as a team. Using the calendar can help reduce the amount of time used on messaging platforms or email threads.
3. Integrate: Streamline your day and your schedule by using one app to cover the tasks of many, This will prevent switching. The Pav*r app allows you to streamline your Google calendar and thus, eliminating the need for so many portals/apps.
4. Collaborate: Make the most of your teamwork on your Google calendar by creating team group calendars. This can allow you to easily divide up tasks and to find time to work together as a team. Using the calendar can help reduce the amount of time used on messaging platforms or email threads.
5. Improve your time management: Set recurring work time blocks on your Google calendar to make sure that no time is wasted. This will also allow you to work in much needed breaks. The structure of the time context and time blocking on your calendar will limit distractions.
6. Embrace your coworkers: Host virtual working sessions with zoom or Google meet on your calendar – it allows you to easily send invites and to see responses in one clean place. Bye-bye to lone email threads and too many portals to check! Also, set aside sessions to connect with your workers. This allows you to look over your weekend to reflect where you are going and how far you’ve come!
7. Tool-up: Use the features on Pav*r that help you create instant spreadsheets and more to consolidate your work onto one source. This will make your information and communication flow better, and allow for more accessibility in a single calendar.
8. Prioritize: Prioritization helps you to stay engaged in your tasks. Decide what must be done and give that top priority. Use task lists for smaller tasks to be tackled in free-time.
We need to find ways to be free to focus: a total productivity system to achieve more by doing less. These steps can help.
Be brave and try new approaches. Does working less hours increase productivity for you? How does time management affect productivity for your team? How interruptions affect productivity in a day for your office?
Have real conversations with your team mates about tasks and how things could work best for them, too. Ask your team more questions, like: How would you handle a situation in which you had several different tasks/assignments? How is productivity affected when employees multitask?
Find real solutions together. Share calendars to see each other’s availability more clearly. Productivity is more about rhythm and less about speed. Focus on your goals as a team.
Stop Human Context Switching
We all realize that context switching is very much a part of all of our lives. To some degree, we can’t completely get rid of it. However, by taking some small steps, we can regain control over our day!
Life may sometimes feel like a series of a million portal doors, but we can set aside time on our calendars to allow for that distraction. AND we can eliminate as many of those doors as we can.
Take steps to control this constant battle for your time and attention by using our Pav*r app and Google calendar for simplifying scheduling, production meetings, setting work hours, and for protecting your time off.
Soon, you will enjoy a new peace of mind – through focused work and thoughtful planning, simplified.

18,https://getpavr.com/how-to-create-time-boundaries-at-work/,"Our world today has so many expectations on us. Do you ever feel like you’re being pulled in every direction all at once?
Between work responsibilities, home responsibilities and personal needs, how are we supposed to fit everything in and stay balanced? Emotionally happy? Fully engaged?
Work is especially controlling at times – invading every moment. Current technology has made working from home even more flexible, but is that always the best thing for us?
Our ever-changing workplaces settings make it difficult to set productive and healthy boundaries with our employers.
So, how can we arrange healthy time boundaries?
What Exactly Are Time Boundaries?
First, let’s define what time boundaries are.
Time boundaries are literal ways in which we protect our time each day and night.
The intention with setting boundaries is to protect you from feeling that you must agree to do things that are an unfair use of your time, and to shield you from things that you don’t want to do, or are uncomfortable doing.
Three examples of time boundaries are:
- I only take calls from 9:30-5:30 M-F for work.
- All of my evenings are set aside for my spouse and children.
- Every weekday morning I go to the gym from 8-9.
We can set work related time boundaries to also allow us to produce more. To focus more. To feel safe.
Some work boundaries include:
- Limited time slots for meetings and appointments
- Deadlines on cancellations of meetings and appointments
- Limits to your personal disclosure
- Personal space boundaries
- Setting a professional tone in your office and space
How To Set Healthy Time Boundaries
It is important to set healthy boundaries with your employees and employer from day 1. This sets the tone that will stay.
Starting with your first interview, you can show how you expect to be treated. Describe your ideal work-life balance expectations. Detail your boundaries and chosen limits. Then, stick to these limits or you’ll see your situation decline at work.
Common boundary destroyers:
- Being too physically and emotionally available
- Completing work that is outside of your job description
- Checking work email 24/7
- Allowing payments to be late
- Allowing your times to be changed or appointments to be canceled
- Missing family events due to work
A loss of boundaries will literally have you feeling broken down, and disrespected. It causes work tensions and toxic environments. This is why you must see the importance of setting boundaries from the get-go.
Types Of Boundaries At Work
There are different types of boundaries at work: mental, physical, and emotional.
Mental Boundaries
Do you ever feel that you are in a fog? Or that work is generally bringing your mood down to the point of not wanting to go into the office?
Maybe an employee is crossing lines and putting you in an awkward position at work. This can all be very draining, and should be addressed. Take care of your mental health!
Some examples of mental boundaries include:
- Hours: Choose hours that work for you, and stick to them.
- Focus time: Protect your ability to focus by setting away messages so that you can fully engage in your work projects.
- Work drama: Avoid all drama in the office among your co-workers. It’s hard to do, but worth it!
Physical Boundaries
This may not seem necessary, but if professional boundaries are being abused, it’ll be clear.
Some examples of physical boundaries include:
- Touch: Your space is your own. Choose handshakes over hugs
- Alone time: Ask others to respect when you want to be alone
- 24/7: Don’t require yourself to go to all work events after hours, and protect your weekends.
- Health: Demand that your personal health issues are respected and honored (such as nursing breaks, standing desks, etc)
Emotional Boundaries
Emotional boundaries are tied into communication in the office place – even if you work remotely.
Creating an environment that is rich in empathy and understanding is key for a nice work environment.
Examples of emotional boundaries include:
- Communicate your feelings clearly and effectively.
- Give and receive feedback.
- Make sure work is evenly distributed.
- Listen clearly to others.
Your schedule should be fair and clear to others.

How To Say No At Work
Do you know how to say no without feeling guilty?
DO you know how to say no without hurting someone feelings?
Sometimes we need to say no. Saying yes when you want to say no is an issue. It’s not easy to say no, in any situations. It’s especially difficult at work. Fear of loss of work or causing ruffled feathers makes many people stay quiet.
That’s why it’s important to learn how to say no when needed effectively. There are many different ways to say no.
Here are some simple ways to say no without saying no:
- How to say no politely at work: I’m sorry that I can not help you right now.
- How to say no to overtime at work: I can not add any additional work at the moment.
- How to say no to work requests: I do not take appointments at that time.
- How to politely decline helping someone after work: I have a previous engagement and can not attend.
- How to say no without being rude: Thank you for thinking of me, but I can’t today.
- How to say no to a project at work: Unfortunately, I have too much to do today.
- How to say no when work calls you in at off hours: I do not work on weekends but I’ll tackle this on Monday.
When to say yes and when to say no is really up to you – you know what your own demands and time are.
Remember, less is more they say – not all details are needed when saying no. Sometimes that reads as excuses. Simply, quickly and clearly state, “ No. I can’t”, and find other ways of saying no that are comfortable for you.
Knowing how to say no to your boss can be far more complicated. It’s hard to know what to say at the moment.
Some thoughts:
- Approach the situation with empathy.
- Gently tell them about the boundaries you set for yourself.
- Communicate politely and respectfully.
- Offer alternative solutions with-in your boundaries.
Do keep in mind that you can set messages to protect your time. Most email platforms have a “do not disturb” feature you can utilize.
Boundaries For Good
Setting boundaries allows you to set your expectations in stone – and that’s a good thing! Learning to say no at work isn’t easy, but it’s necessary for your own peace.
Group projects and assignments are more easily planned when your boundaries are clear. This can help to prevent bumps in the road with your boss and fellow workers. They’ll respect you, and your time!
When issues do come up, learn to say no at work! Try to know your limits with set focused “me” time. Respect your own energy, responsibilities, and feelings.
Knowing how to set healthy boundaries at work is crucial for everyone. When your boundaries are set up front you protect yourself – and others- from overstepping limits. This allows you to succeed in life to your highest potential.
Remember, if you feel that your boundaries are constantly disregarded in the workplace, you may be in an environment that is toxic for you. Make changes.
Set boundaries: when to say yes, how to say no to take control of your life!

Another great way to be organized and productive is to set google calendar “focus time”. You can do this easily. Have a separate calendar just for work. Focus on your workweek by using the “work week” view. Simply go to settings and unclick “show weekends”.

How To Create & Share Your Group Calendar
How do I share my google calendar?
Are you an administrator at your job? Or do you organize school events or fundraisers and need to share work? If so, it’s going to be super important for you to be on the same page as your team during the process, so make a shared Google calendar!
To keep things organized, you can create a calendar that you can share with all of the people in your team or organization. This is called a group calendar.
Here are the simple directions from Google to create a group calendar:
Create a group calendar
How to add someone to google calendar…
Put the names of the people you wish to share your calendar with in their own group. Now, follow these steps to Create your group:
Open your Google Calendar.
On the left, next to Other calendars, click Add Create new calendar.
Add the name of the calendar (for example, Thanksgiving Event At Shady Side Elementary) , add the description, and a time zone.
Click Create calendar.
Now that your group calendar is created, you’ll need to share it! Here are the simple steps from Google to share your calendar!
Share Your Calendar
How to add people to google calendar….

On the left, click the calendar you want to share.
Click on more Settings and sharing.
Choose who you want to share your calendar with.
In the permissions box, click the Down arrow and choose an option.

Link google calendar: After you have completed this, Google sends out a group calendar invitation. It will include the links to your calendar for everyone you’ve shared with.
Now you know how to add someone to your google calendar! What’s wonderful about this is that the email notification will include a link. This will guide them on how to add other calendars to google calendar in their Other calendars list.
Having Trouble Finding a Shared Calendar?
If you or your clients are having trouble finding the shared calendar, you can do several things.
First, send out a calendar ID with these steps:
Open your Google Calendar.
Under My calendars, find your shared calendar.
Click More Settings and sharing.
Click Integrate calendar, and copy the Calendar ID.
(It’s actually quite long!)
Send this ID to anyone having trouble finding the shared calendar.

21,https://getpavr.com/how-to-stay-organized-with-google-calendar/,"Setting goals, meeting deadlines, putting out fires, and managing a to-do list that only ever seems to get longer as the week goes on can quickly become frustrating.
You end your week wondering if you actually made any progress, despite knowing that you put in plenty of time.
How can you stay organized and ensure all of your priorities are being met when you already feel overwhelmed?
It’s actually easier than you might think, and if you’re already using Google Calendar to manage your important meetings and events, you’re already halfway there.
Here’s how to stay organized and measure your progress with Google Calendar.
- Mind Sweep
Get everything you need to do, want to do, and are obligated to do out of your mind and onto paper (or a Google doc, whatever works for you).
This is more than a to-do list because it’s meant to clear out the clutter – the things that will inevitably pop up and distract you while you’re trying to work on something else.
Just because you write it down doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to get done immediately, but it does mean it has a permanent place to live where it can’t interfere with the other things you need to prioritize.
Add to this list any time something comes up so you feel confident you won’t forget about it.
- Categorize your list
Creating categories will help you create balance between what you have to do and what you want to do. You’ll assign colors to each of these categories so you can quickly look at your calendar and see how your week is stacking up.
Which categories you choose will be totally up to you and the work you need to do and/or want to measure, but here are a few ideas to get you started:
– Meetings
– Project Work
– Marketing
– Business Development
– Personal
- Add your must-do’s
You likely already have your scheduled meetings and events on your calendar, but what about the work that has to be done to meet project deadlines, or the action items that have to be completed to ensure you reach your big goals?
Break these goals and projects into smaller tasks that you can complete throughout your week and month so you’re not left scrambling to get things done on time or left wondering why you still haven’t made any progress toward your goals.
Pick a day and time/length of time you’re going to work on these tasks and add them to your calendar. Treat this block of time like you would any other important meeting or event on your calendar – meaning you won’t cancel or reschedule it unless absolutely necessary.
- Add reactive time
Emails need to be responded to, unexpected phone calls will need to be had, and there is undoubtedly going to be something, or someone, pop up that you did not plan for.
Create time for these things before they happen by adding reactive time to your calendar.
By doing this, you eliminate the sense of urgency these often come with and put yourself back in the driver’s seat of your time by being able to say “I can’t do this right now, but I have time for it at (whatever time you’ve scheduled a reactive block)”.
- Add focus time
You’ve created space for the things that absolutely must get done, you’ve created space to react to the unexpected, now it’s time to create space to focus.
Focus on the other tasks on your to-do list or simply let yourself breathe for a moment so you can gain clarity or find inspiration.
Add time to your calendar to focus on what might cause you stress or anxiety in the future and spend that time eliminating those feelings for your future self by completing those tasks or making enough progress on them that they don’t become a problem.
Measure your success
With Pav*r, you can create detailed reports of exactly how you spent your time. Those Categories you created can be easily added and color-coded, plus you can create Labels if you want to get an even more granular report of your time.
For example, if your Category is Project Work, you could have labels for each of the clients whose projects you’re working on so you can see both how much time you spent on project work overall, and see how much time you spent on each client.
Our detailed reports will show you a pie chart of exactly how much time you spent on each calendar category and label, and will produce a spreadsheet that includes every calendar entry.
Use Pav*r to help you not only understand where your time is going, but measure your progress towards your goals or use the data to adjust how much time you spend in each category.
Spent 30% of your time in meetings last week? Maybe you decide to say no to more meetings so you can spend more time on income-producing activities.
Remember, if you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it. With Pav*r, you’ll have an easy way to measure your time so you can better manage it to feel more in control of your most important resource.
How to Stay Organized with Google Calendar
- Color Code Calendars
- Utilize the Calendar list to manage things like your own calendar, holidays, tasks, reminders, etc. By assigning a color to each you will spend less time having to find each calendar and can visually see how you’re spending your time throughout the day.
- Utilize All The Features
- To the right side of your calendar, you’ll find features that seamlessly integrate into your calendar and can also be utilized from anywhere. Tasks allow you to keep track of your to-do lists in multiple places while also allowing you to set a date and time for them to be completed. They’ll now automatically show in your calendar if you have it selected!
- Add Pav*r app plug
- Share Your Calendar
- Cut back on repeating your schedule through emails, texts, or phone calls.
- Take In the Views
- You can adjust how you view your calendar easily. My preference is to have it on a weekly view and I can switch between day or month if I’d like. If you’re a person who also likes to have paper to write on or your job doesn’t allow you to have a device in some areas, it may be helpful to you to print out your calendar in the morning for that day. Through settings you can easily print your day so you can scribble or doodle- whatever makes you most productive!
- Sync or Swim
- The digital age allows us to synchronize our apps together so we can spend less time entering and exiting applications – meaning we have more time for more important things!
- Speak Up- Use Your Voice
- Want to avoid having to open your calendar to manually add something to the calendar? Need to add something to your calendar quickly and not get distracted by the rest of your phone or computer? You can simply ask google! Now that is being efficient and productive!"
22,https://getpavr.com/investment/,"Frequently Asked Questions
What is pav*r?
The path to productivity. Pav*r leverages your calendar data to help you get more done in less time.
Pav*r is a web-based application that integrates directly with your Google Calendar and makes it possible for the more than one billion people that are using digital calendars to take control of every minute of their lives. With pav*r, you’ll be able to:
Categorize your calendar events
Label your events
Export your calendar to a Google Sheet
Set goals
Receive smart notifications about how you’re spending your time and make recommendations based on your goals
Create at-a-glance views by categories and labels to see how you spend your time
Tracking, reporting, and document creating using the calendar data (who, what, when, where)
Why invest?
Great question! Here are a few of the reasons we think pav*r is a great investment:
RIGHT PLACE: 1,000+ users in 20+ countries within the first 90 days, found organically through G Suite Marketplace listing.
RIGHT TIME: More teams than ever are working remotely and relying on their calendars for more than just appointment reminders.
RIGHT TEAM: Founders are Google experts with more than a decade of experience of integrating Google’s business tools like Google Calendar.
RIGHT TECHNOLOGY: Leveraging machine learning and automation to learn how users spend their time.
SOLVING THE RIGHT PROBLEM: Time is the most precious resource we have, and data has been described as “more valuable than oil”, yet we can’t access the most important data we have — data about our time. Pav*r is solving that problem.
ON THE RIGHT PLATFORM: Highly scalable SaaS platform with 75%+ margins.
FOR THE RIGHT MARKET: Productivity Software Market is projected to hit $96.36 Bn by 2025
What is Equity Crowdfunding?
We chose to partner with WeFunder to raise our round because we wanted to give everyone the opportunity to invest in pav*r. Most traditional investment routes require investors to be accredited and/or require a minimum investment of $5,000-$10,000 or more. We didn’t want that barrier to exist for our first round of raising because we wanted to share this opportunity with everyone.
You can think of WeFunder like “Kickstarter for investing”. Unlike Kickstarter, you are not buying a product or donating to an artist. Instead, you are investing in a business with the hope of earning a return.
How & when do I earn a return on my investment?
We are raising on a Convertible Note. Most early-stage technology startups use a Convertible Note or Simple Agreement for Future Equity. These will convert your investment to stock at a later date if the company raises a “priced round” from major investors, most often venture capitalists. At this point, you are a shareholder owning equity, and you earn a return if the value of that stock goes up over time, and you are able to sell it.
In terms of how long it will take to earn a return, you will be waiting for the company to go public or to be acquired. Our goal for pav*r is to be acquired within 5-7 years, however, that is just an estimate and it could take much longer for this to happen.
If you’re new to investing, we highly recommend you check out the FAQ page on WeFunder’s website to learn more.
Meet the Founders
We started Pav*r because we saw a need. We’ve spent nearly a decade running our serviced-based business helping other small businesses integrate and automate their business processes using Google’s business tools like Google Calendar. But time and again, we found ourselves trying to add more information to the calendar or extract the information out of the calendar so we could use it to create reports or other documents that our business clients needed.
Data duplication is the exact opposite of productivity and we knew that if we could help our clients gain access to their data we could not only help them save a ton of time, but they could use that data to make better decisions.

48,https://getpavr.com/time-blocking-strategies-that-actually-work/,"- Your to-do list is always a mile long
- You frequently find yourself wondering where your day went
- You keep pushing back the same tasks or goals
- You have tried a million time management apps or methods and nothing seems to work
If you answered yes to even one of these questions, this post is definitely for you!
In this blog I’ll be sharing how you can finally start crossing things off of your to-do list once and for all and begin accomplishing those big goals you set for yourself and your business.
Time Blocking Strategies That Actually Work
What is time blocking?
Time blocking is one of the most highly used and highly effective time management techniques.
Simply put, time blocking is a time management method of dividing your time into blocks (usually between 30min-2hrs). Each block is dedicated to accomplishing a specific task or group of tasks.
Each time block should be treated as though it is an important meeting. Meaning zero distractions and zero excuses for not attending. Just like you wouldn’t be checking your email, your social media notifications, or taking a phone call during an important meeting, you shouldn’t be allowing those distractions in while you’re working within your time block, either. You also wouldn’t cancel that meeting unless it was absolutely necessary. By treating your time blocks the same way you would important meetings, you’re more likely to accomplish what you set out to do during that block.
It’s easy to think we can manage our clients, customers, family, friends, emails, tasks, projects, and everything else we have to deal with on a daily basis and still find time to do the things that need to be done, but more often than not we can’t manage those things effectively without a really good plan of action and often find ourselves feeling overwhelmed and paralyzed in inaction.
Time blocking can help minimize those feelings and put you in control of your time and, ultimately, your life.
Time Blocking Strategies That Actually Work
If you’ve tried time blocking before and think that it doesn’t or can’t work for you, keep reading. If you’re new to time blocking, start with these strategies and you’ll never look back!
A few things to keep in mind before you get started:
- Think about how long it will take to accomplish. If it’s more than 2 hours I recommend scheduling multiple blocks spread out through the day or week to give yourself time to walk away and come back to it with fresh eyes.
- Add these blocks to your digital calendar — don’t just write them down.
- Remember to treat them like important meetings.
Start with your top priorities
What are the things that absolutely must get done? Whether it’s a single item on your to-do list or something that needs to be completed regularly, schedule your top priorities first.
For example, I know that reviewing my business finances weekly is a top priority for me and I like to do this every Monday morning. I schedule 1-hour on my calendar every Monday morning to review my Quickbooks account and take care of any payables or receivables.
I also know that making enough time for my morning routine is a top priority so I schedule time for it from 8-9am every single day.
Add blocks for reactive tasks
Emails still need to be checked and responded to, meetings still need to be had, and things are inevitably going to pop up that need to be taken care of somewhat immediately. The difference is that by creating a time block for it, you know that it is going to get done so you don’t have to stop what you’re doing to address it.
I recommend scheduling 2-3 30-minute to 1-hour blocks throughout the day for reactive tasks. Try to schedule things like meetings and phone calls during these blocks whenever possible and when something pops up during the day that you need to address same-day, know that it can wait until that scheduled block.
Intentional work
Now that you’ve scheduled your priorities and time for reactive tasks, it’s time to schedule intentional work. Intentional work is time that should be used for doing things like completing projects or creating content — things that generally pertain to your “actual job” — the thing you’re being paid to do. This is usually at least 2 blocks per day and is generally 1-2 hours or more.
Add in your to-do list items
Now that you’ve scheduled your priorities, your reactive tasks, and made time to be intentional about getting work done — is there anything else on your to-do list that you need to conquer? If so, fill in the time gaps in your calendar with these items. Most of the time you’ll find that your to-do list items fit within one of the other categories, but if it doesn’t there should still be some time in your day or week to make sure everything gets done.
How to uplevel your Time Blocking with pav*r
If you’re a Google Calendar user you can take your Time Blocking to the next level by using pav*r. Our Google Calendar add-on will analyze your calendar entries and provide detailed reports of exactly how you spent your time.
With pav*r, you can add tags (called categories & labels) to your calendar events and export your calendar data to see detailed reports about your time usage. This is helpful when trying to understand how you’re using your time and make adjustments based on your goals.
You might find that you spend too much time in meetings and need more intentional work time. Or you might realize that you’re over scope on a project and need to bill additional hours. Pav*r is totally flexible to the needs of your business and you have full control of how you want to analyze your calendar.
How to be successful with Time Blocking
Like any skill, it will take some time to master your time blocking technique and the biggest key to success is consistency.
Make time every single day to review your time blocks. What worked for you yesterday or last week might not work for you today. You might will have a day where everything is completely thrown off track. And that’s okay. The important thing is that you remain consistent.
If you find that you need more or less time for your blocks, adjust them. If you find that something isn’t actually worth your time, stop doing it or delegate it to someone else on your team. If you have to throw the whole thing out and start over, do it. There is no perfect or right way, there is only the way that works for you. By using the strategies outlined in this post, however, you’ll have all of the tools you need to create a strategy that works for you.

49,https://getpavr.com/time-management-techniques-for-busy-people/,"Most of us understand that being busy and being productive aren’t the same thing. We can create busy work for ourselves all day long, but is that work moving you towards your goals? Is it accomplishing something? Or is it just filling up the white space on your calendar?
The answer to your lack of productivity isn’t working more – it’s working more intentionally.
How can you be more intentional so you can get more done in less time? Consider the Intentional Calendar Mapping Method, a simple method of identifying your goals and priorities then creating an intentional plan to make sure you always have time to focus on them.
Step 1: Create a clear vision of success
If you don’t know where your ultimate destination is, how can you map out a way to get there?
Ask yourself these questions to get crystal clear on what your vision of success looks like:
- What does your business and life look like when you’ve “made it”?
- What does your work day look like? Script out “a day in the life” schedule of your perfect work day.
- How much money are you making?
- How do you work with the clients or customers that your business serves?
- What does your personal life look like?
Step 2: Create measurable goals based on your vision
To set realistic and achievable outcomes, we can use the SMART method for setting goals based on what our vision of success is. Remember, SMART stands for:
Specific: What do I want to happen?
Measurable: How will I know when I have achieved my goal?
Attainable: Is the goal realistic?
Relevant: Why is my goal important to me?
Timely: What is my deadline for this goal?
Step 3: Understand where your time is currently going so you can make room for more important things.
Sometimes, to understand where we’re going, we have to first look at where we’ve been. The key to being intentional with your time (and accomplishing more as a result) is to prioritize the things that matter most to you.
More often than not, this means saying no to things that aren’t going to move you closer to your vision of success, and creating time and space for the things that will.
If you already feel short on time, make the effort to review your last 30 days and see where most of your time has been spent.
If you’re already a Pav*r user, running a report would be a great place to start. Remember, good data in = GREAT data out. Pav*r can tell you exactly how and where you’re spending your time.
Step 4: Create your Intentional Calendar Map
Now that you’ve set your SMART goals and created time on your calendar to work towards them, you’re ready to create your Intentional Calendar Map! Here’s what you’ll put on your calendar:
1. Implementation Intentions for working towards your SMART goals.
An implementation intention is created by saying I will work on [goal] at [day/time] in [location]. Create implementation intentions for each of your SMART goals then add them to your calendar and remember to treat that calendar event just like you would any other important meeting or event – meaning you would never cancel it unless absolutely necessary.
2. Reactive Time
Reactive time is time for doing things like checking emails, taking last minute meetings or phone calls, and for any other “fires” that might pop up during your day. By creating space for these tasks ahead of time, you not only guarantee they get done, but you take back control of your time by saying “I can’t do this right now, but I have time for it at (whatever time you’ve scheduled a reactive block)”.
3. To-Do List Tasks
There’s always going to be things on your to-do list that aren’t necessarily part of your SMART goals. There’s work that needs to be done to keep your life and your business moving forward. Make time for these tasks throughout the day so you ensure you stay on schedule and don’t have to worry about what’s slipping through the cracks. Once you’ve scheduled your SMART goal Implementation Intentions, Reactive Time, and To-Do List time, you’ve got a calendar map that can be exported from the Pav*r application! Our goal with an Intentional Calendar Map isn’t to fill every second of your day, it’s to create time for the things that are going to create that vision of success and give you back time to spend however you want. The only thing left to do is to review & revise your calendar map as needed. Create reports weekly, or monthly, in Pav*r to see where your time is going so you can plan better for the week/month ahead.

It’s important for all of us to take a close look at how we are handling our busy lives every once in a while. Afterall, time management directly affects our ability to reach specific goals.
Managing your time in a busy work week isn’t always that easy. However, google calendar and Pav*r can streamline this process for you.
Some Simple Tips For Your Google Calendar
First, let’s talk about some simple Google calendar hacks for using your google calendar.
Here is a list of a few tips to utilize your google calendar effectively, to help you stay organized and on time:
1. Check Settings: Check to see if your devices are set to the Google calendar as a default. For example, if you have an iphone, your events may not be popping up on your google calendar, they may instead be going to an icloud calendar. So, simply go to Settings > Calendar and check settings for the correct email default for your calendar.
2. Sharing: If you are wondering how to add events to a shared google calendar, no worries! Google calendar has settings to include your family members (or team members) to keep them up to date on your work/life schedule. This can help take the guess-work out of your life. You can also add your children’s school calendars, town calendars,etc onto your google calendar.
3. Notifications: Notifications are very helpful. Receiving a pop-up reminder 24 hours before your appointments can give you time to prepare and be on time. Are you confused about how to set reminders on google calendar? It could not be more simple. You can customize alert times as you see fit within your event as you add it to your candar. Also, you can also set your calendar to send you email notifications to alert you of any possible modifications to your events and events you are added to, such as a possible cancellation or a change in time or venue.
4. Goal Setting: If you have a smartphone, you can set goals (like: learn piano, workout 3 times this week, family time, read a book) to your google calendar. Within your smartphone’s app, you can add recurring goal “events” which help you manage your time effectively for reaching personal and work goals. Google calendar can be a mini life coach – helping you be your best self.
5. Find A Time: If you are wondering how to propose a new time in google calendar to your colleagues, read this: Instead of coordinating events with email threads that are a mile long, google calendar can suggest a new time for you. Simply select the “Find a Time” section next to “Event Details”. Then, add the guests that you want to include in your event scheduling. This allows you to see and find a time that all parties are free – google will even suggest the best times for everyone. Simple!
6. Set Your Work Hours: These days, we are often working from home. This sometimes blurs your work and home life. Google calendar can help you set specific times for your work hours, giving you a happy work/life balance. Appointment setting can happen during set blocks of work time, making your choices and availability streamlined. This is also a helpful feature when it comes to time-zone related work scheduling. You can also easily change google calendar time zones for yourself. Google can handle all of this for you in settings.
7. Google’s Calendars of Interest: Worried that you may forget an important holiday? No need to manually add holidays to Google calendar – Google provides a helpful “Other Calendars” section. You can subscribe to and import several calendars from around the world. So, no worries – you won’t forget Memorial day again!
8. Invitations and Zoom/Slack: If you are wondering how to forward a google calendar invite – no worries. Simply add an email address to your event and google will notify and add the individuals for you.You can easily integrate zoom with google calendar and integrate Google calendar with Slack within an individual event by adding links, too.
9. Canceling: If you are wondering how to cancel an event on google calendar, well, it could not be more simple. Simply click on your event and select “cancel”. Google will notify your invites, and allow you to easily reschedule if needed.
10. Google calendar privacy: No worries, you can make google calendar and specific events private if you’d like to, also. It’s all in the Google calendar privacy settings and Google calendar permissions.
11. Shortcuts: Be sure to visit the Google Shortcuts page for some handy keyboard shortcuts for ease of use.
