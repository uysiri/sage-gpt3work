At Gray Scalable, we know how important it is to match the right candidates with the right companies. We hope every interview results in a perfect fit – but we also know that some of them won’t. Here’s part one of a two-part guide for both candidates and clients to brush up on The Art of Rejection. Check back next week for Part II – The Art of Rejection for Candidates.
I have a confession: rejecting candidates is the worst part of my job as a recruiter. I feel like a dream-killer, that messenger bearing bad news waiting to be shot. But over the years, I’ve found that the way I reject candidates makes a huge difference, and makes it less painful to do. When done right, rejecting candidates can go a long way to cultivate long-term relationships and build employer brands. Too much of a lemon into lemonade, you say? Read on.
For companies doing the rejecting, it’s a delicate dance. You need to be true to your hiring plan and maintain a high bar. But even the least qualified and most unlikeable candidates need to have a great experience as they interact with you and your company’s brand. And the candidates you really loved but couldn’t hire for whatever reason? You definitely need to give them the white glove treatment. Here are a few guidelines for how to reject people the right way:
Be Timely
Once you’ve made the decision, figure out the best timing for delivering your message. There’s a degree of subjectivity here, but most of the time, you probably don’t want to reject someone too quickly after meeting them for the first time. That can give the impression that they never stood a chance in the first place – or that you rejected them without giving it enough thought. And you pretty much never should reject them on the spot. But don’t let it fester too long either – don’t let candidates find out by default when they see you take down a job posting, for example. If possible, set expectations at the outset about when you’ll get back to them – say, after a round of interviews is complete, or after a week’s time. Set reminders in your calendar and follow through on your commitment.
Be Honest
There’s a tendency either to give way too much information, or to give none at all. Some companies are so risk-averse that they have policies prohibiting giving a reason for rejecting a candidate. My advice is to keep it human, keep it brief, and be as honest as you can be. In most cases, you can honestly say that you had to make a tough decision, and ultimately had to go with someone whose experience was a closer match to the job description. It’s better if you can give more details (were they missing some key skill?) – but it’s best to keep the topic of your feedback to objective measures like their skills and ability to do the job, and not their personality or culture fit. While a lot of companies leave the rejecting to HR or Recruiting precisely because it can be a sticky area, if you are the hiring manager, it’s important to be prepared with an honest answer to a follow-up call or email from a candidate who was rejected.
Be Nice
It’s hard to interview. It’s uncomfortable and emotional, and many times, there’s a lot riding on the interviews for the candidate. So, just be nice, but not overly so. Keep the feedback brief and objective, and don’t shy away from saying you enjoyed meeting the candidate – who knows, you may consider them again in the future, or you may end up working with them elsewhere in the future.
At the end of the day, you’re basically following The Golden Rule. Treat candidates as you’d like to be treated, and always keep your employment brand in mind. Everyone’s ultimately a potential customer!

“If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late.” Reid Hoffman’s quote has become increasingly relevant to me as my little company grows and matures. I look back on some of the challenges of my first year - developing things from scratch for each new client, working out the logistics of multiple workplaces and managing part-time subcontractors - and I take comfort in the hindsight that can frame these as necessary stages of evolution for a company that aspires to do things in a new and better way. Experiments that had to happen (some successful, some not).
We’re a service business, not a product business, but three years in we are now launching Gray Scalable 3.0, with dramatic upgrades to our UI and our efficiency. Last year’s 2.0 added key team members and solidified the “service products” we offer our clients - now, we are prepared to really offer the depth and polish and long term value to these companies that were nothing but aspirational back in 2012, when we could only focus on plain and simple results.
The past few months have brought more great and diverse talent to the team, a new office, a new ATS, lots of exciting new clients and partnerships - and even new funding!

It's no secret to our clients and our talent community that Greenhouse is one of our favorite products, favorite clients, and favorite companies. We loved their product since its launch 5 years ago, and it's been a pleasure to see them grow their teams (and help them once in a while). It has also been beneficial to our business to implement Greenhouse at client after client to help them scale.
We were also impressed when they asked Maia Josebachvili to head their people operations function a couple of years ago, with her amazingly versatile background and commitment to building high-performance organizations.
Last week, Maia published a framework for quantifying the importance and value of a great talent and people function. For executives that ask ""What's the ROI?"", Maia has provided the answer. I would encourage all practitioners of the people arts to read it here and find a way to apply it (or something like it) at your companies.
Thanks for sharing, Maia!
How to understand the ROI of investing in People
Articulating the return on investment (ROI) of People Practices is extremely challenging. Unlike other departments in the organization, the output of the People Team isn’t as directly tied to business outcomes and has few measurable outputs. Because of this, it’s difficult to demonstrate the absolute value of making investments in your talent or talent practices.
However even small improvements in hiring, onboarding, and managing talent can result in significant ROI for the business. In this whitepaper, I’ll walk through a case study that quantifies the return of a handful of People Practices and propose a framework to help you articulate the ROI of People Practices more broadly.
To help assess the business impact of People Practices I would like to introduce and define a new concept: using Employee Lifetime Value (ELTV) to compare the relative return of People Practices.
Defining ELTV
Employee Lifetime Value represents the total net value over time that an employee brings to an organization. The People Team’s job is to drive the organization to maximize ELTV. It can achieve this goal by developing and executing programs that impact the inputs that drive ELTV. When we put these programs into the context of the employee lifetime value, we can more clearly see their relative ROI and their contribution to the business.
This concept is illustrated in the graph below, which presents ELTV in terms of the employee lifecycle. The X axis represents time, spanning from the start date to the day the employee leaves and the Y axis represents employee output.
At the “Start,” an employee’s output is negative because they’re not yet doing anything to contribute to the team but they have consumed resources from the recruiting and hiring team.
They then ramp up productivity until reaching the next milestone, “Fully contributing”, where an employee has fully ramped up in their role.
At some point, an employee’s growth plateaus and they start to consider other employment options. They make the “Decision to leave.” Generally after this point their productivity starts to decrease.
Finally, an employee reaches their “Last day” at the company. Their output goes to zero at this point.
The 4 inputs of ELTV
The ELTV of the employee is represented by the gray-shaded area under the curve (the integral, for those who like calculus). The goal is generally to make this area as tall and as wide as possible. Note: This is a simplified version of the curve for illustration purposes. In reality, there are dips and valleys and it’s generally not as linear.
As illustrated, there are four ways to increase ELTV, or maximize the area under the curve:
These inputs can be loosely mapped to a handful of strategic People Practices, as presented below. In reality, each of these practices impacts the whole curve, but for the sake of illustrating the impact, I’ve isolated the variables.
Onboarding: A good onboarding program accomplishes two goals: 1) It decreases the time it takes an employee to become a fully contributing member, and 2) It significantly increases the likelihood that the employee will stay with the company long-term.
Hiring: An excellent hire has a higher maximum output from the beginning, plus has the added network effect of attracting and elevating other top performers.
Management & Development: Excellent management and development practices increase the value an employee brings to the organization over time.
Management & Culture: A strong management practice and positive culture are directly correlated with retention, which results in an increase in ELTV.
A note on the supporting data behind these statements:
The Greenhouse team did a thorough review of the existing research on these topics. While not exhaustive, we covered most of the major papers published in the last ten years. Our takeaway is that there is not nearly enough good research and data out there to draw precise conclusions about the impact of these practices. The information is directional and we feel comfortable making assumptions based on it, *and* we’d like to be a part of the movement to get more data created in this space. I've included the supporting data I used in an appendix below.
Case study | The impact of People practices on ELTV
To demonstrate the impact of these inputs, let’s consider two common scenarios. To illustrate how much impact even a small improvement in People Practices can have, I’ll use conservative assumptions for each input. In reality, the differences can actually be much greater.
- Scenario 1: A normal organization with average People Practices
- Scenario 2: An organization with slightly better, more optimized People Practices
We’ll use salespeople for our scenarios, as their output is more directly measurable than many other roles. Let’s assume that in both Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 the salespeople have salaries of $5,000/mo and quotas of $50,000/mo. Their projected output per month is $50,000 of revenue less their salary of $5,000, resulting in $45,000 net revenue per month.
An important note: For most roles, output will not be easily measured with one number. In those cases, you might perform a similar exercise, but just compare the different scenarios and assess based on relative value. Generally the differences will be compelling enough, even absent precise calculations.
Impact of Onboarding
Conservative assumption: A better onboarding program that encompasses pre-boarding, a deliberate new hire experience, and training can decrease an employee’s ramp time by 30%.
Impact of Talent Acquisition
Conservative assumption: A better hire —which can be achieved by taking a structured and data-driven approach to sourcing, interviewing, and closing—can outperform a peer by 20%.
Impact of management & development
Conservative assumption: Great management and development practices that involve coaching and training can improve an employee’s performance by 20% in a year.
The million-dollar revelation
If we continue the graph out over three years and assume that it takes 4 months to backfill the salesperson in scenario 1, the relative difference in ELTV becomes staggering. In the case study we walked through, the difference between average and slightly optimized People Practices for one salesperson over the course of three years is $1,300,000 in net revenue, or a 2.5x difference for the organization.
In this case study, the difference between average and slightly optimized People Practices for one salesperson over the course of three years is $1,300,000 in net revenue, or a 2.5x difference for the organization.
Applying ELTV to roles with less measurable outputs
The output of a salesperson is easy to measure. It becomes a lot harder to articulate the output of other roles that have less quantifiable impacts. However, the relative difference in ELTV between average versus great People Practices is so dramatic that simply comparing two scenarios can give you enough information to assess the ROI of a particular initiative.
We can apply ELTV to Engineering, but instead of “net revenue” on the Y-axis, let’s use an abstract concept of “engineering productivity”. In the sales case study, I assumed a 20% difference between the two salespeople. In engineering, I’ve heard some people say that a great engineer is 10xas good as an average engineer. For the sake of sticking with conservative assumptions, we’ll assume that difference in engineer #1 and engineer #2 is 3x.
The ELTV difference between these two engineering examples is 6.6x over three years. Put another way, that means that one engineer in scenario 2 can do the work of 6 engineers in scenario 1. That’s a staggering return on investment from a handful of People programs.
What this model isn’t trying to say
I’m really excited about this concept. And there’s one part of it that I hate. I hate that it implies that people are a number (i.e., their ELTV). For my entire career, I’ve prioritized building awesome teams and cultivating the best work environment I can. For me, investing in people, their development, and the way we all work together is the end goal. I want my team to grow, develop, make an impact, and have fun at work. If I had unlimited resources, I’d throw most of them into my people. BUT, unlimited resources is not the reality of most businesses. As an executive, I have to make hard choices about where to invest. And so I developed the ELTV model as a framework to help me justify and articulate all of the investments I think should be made in people. I sincerely hope that businesses use this framework in that lens, and realize that investing in your talent isn’t just the right thing to do, it’s the smart thing to do. Life is better when work is more engaging, more rewarding, and more fun, and it just so happens that we can make a case for that philosophy from an ROI perspective too.
Summing it up
- Use ELTV to assess the ROI of People Practices.
- ELTV inputs: hiring, onboarding, management, development, & culture
- When it’s not possible to calculate precise values, defer to comparing relative output. The differences are so significant that the ROI will be fairly obvious.
- Even small improvements in the inputs can have a dramatic impact on ELTV. In one of the case studies above, we saw a 6x difference in the ELTV of one employee over 3 years.

As a Tech Recruiting Consultant, Emily spends about half her time recruiting, mainly for engineering roles (anywhere from junior to executive), and half consulting, working with our clients to evaluate, measure, and iterate on their interview processes.
Her clients love her data-driven and thoughtful approach to recruiting - and have a hard time letting her leave at the end of her engagements! She build strong relationships with her clients and becomes a valued part of their team. As one of her teammates put it, “this girl runs meetings like a boss!”
Her favorite projects?
“Spring was my first client - the leaders I partnered with had this awesome mix of strong leadership ability and humility. It was incredibly exciting to help them build their team from the ground floor. They’ve gone from 30 employees to now over 100 and continue to be successful in a tough market - it’s been so rewarding to watch them grow!
Working with BuzzFeed has been fun because we got to work with engineering leadership to re-build their interview process from scratch. It's unusual to get to build a new process at a company as established and large as BuzzFeed!
On the flip side, I've worked with Namely on and off and have done more recruiting there than consulting, which I’ve also really enjoyed. It’s exciting to work on an HR product for HR people - one that is still being built and constantly evolving.
Last year I worked with Harry's and enjoyed them a lot, too, specifically because they're a company of really smart people that think critically about interviewing and hiring.”
Not only has Emily helped many of our clients hire some amazing engineers - as Scalable employee #3, she has also been an integral part of establishing Gray Scalable's tech recruiting process and brand. She continues to act as a sort of “social glue” that brings the Gray Scalable team together as more of a family than colleagues. For example, Emily brought the Gray Scalable team to Seattle this past weekend to celebrate her wedding! Congratulations, Emily and Nick!!!"

The Simple Truth About Good 1:1s
One of the training programs we deliver most often is Management 101, where we help educate managers on their organization's leadership principles as well as provide a refresher on management basics like 1:1s, performance management, comp conversations, etc. A lot of the managers we work with are first-time managers, as is often the case within start-ups, and a question that I always receive is a request for a template to follow for 1:1s. People want a script to follow to make their 1:1s as efficient (and as little work) as possible.
The truth is, there’s no magic script. And really, there shouldn't be.
1:1s are a manager's opportunity to connect with their employee and allow them the chance to be heard. They are not just another status update.
To that end, managers should be empowering their employees to own the 1:1. Rather than driving the conversation, they should be giving their team members an opportunity to discuss what they need - whether that's help problem solving, prioritizing or just venting.
It is a manager's job to set a regular 1:1, with enough time to have a meaningful conversation, and then make sure it happens, always. Then let the employee drive that conversation.
In his post, The Update, The Vent, and The Disaster, Rands in Repose offers a great perspective on reading the room in a 1:1 and responding appropriately. It is a useful road map to help categorize your employee's needs in a 1:1 and then make that meeting the most effective use of time possible. If there is any possible template for managers to use, this is the one.

While employer brand will help you attract candidates, the main way a candidate interacts with your company is through the hiring process. And their experience during the process can make or break their decision to work at your company.
Candidate experience is a popular buzzword in the recruiting world, with tons of articles and blogs giving tips on how to improve candidate experience, suggesting everything from storyboarding the candidate experience to hiring a Candidate Experience Manager.
While these tips are mainly good, they make candidate experience seem more complicated than it is. At its core, candidate experience is about making sure your candidates are treated with respect during the interview process.
Luckily, there are many easy fixes that will help you win over candidates, even if you don’t have a ton of resources or time to dedicate.
Over-Communicate
Many of us have experienced the frustration of interviewing with a company, never to hear back again. Or going through three, four, or five rounds of interviews that cover the same topics.
These are issues that seem to plague companies of every size and stage. Recruiting is a tough gig that requires juggling tons of competing priorities, so keeping all candidates up-to-date at all times can be exceptionally challenging.
But for those companies that communicate well, it really sets them apart. Here are a few easy tips to better communicate with your candidates:
Explain your full process at the first phone screen.
It’s OK if you expect the interviews to take two rounds but may extend it to three, or if you’re not entirely sure what the full process looks like. Still, explain as much as possible about how many steps and how long the process usually takes.
Continuously set expectations about the timeline.
After each interview stage, let your candidate know when to expect to hear back, and stick with it! Even if it’s going to be longer than you’d like, letting candidates know that they will hear back in a week puts their minds at ease.
When in doubt, over-communicate.
More information is almost always appreciated, even if it’s a quick check-in to remind them you haven’t forgotten about them.
Treat Your Candidates Exceptionally Well
Don’t just be nice, be thoughtful.
Early in my career, an engineer I was working with told me a story about interviewing with a large company. It was six hours of interviews starting at 10am, with no break for food. By mid-afternoon, he was absolutely famished, and asked his interviewer if he could stop by the vending machine down the hall.
I believe that this level of oversight is relatively rare, but being diligent about treating your candidates well can definitely set your company apart.
If your candidate is meeting more than one person, check in with them throughout the day. This is super simple. Make it a point to check in with them, make sure everything’s running smoothly, grab them a cup of coffee, etc.
Find ways to go above and beyond. Is your candidate traveling to interview with you? Send them recommendations and tips for things to do in your city. Do they seem really excited about your company? Send them home with a t-shirt.
Keep in touch. There are always candidates that aren’t a fit right now - they decline your offer, you don’t have a team to put them on, or they’re too junior. Keep in touch with these folks! You may end up interviewing or hiring them again. Check in with candidates you really like, take them out to coffee or lunch on occasion, or invite them to events at your office.
Move Quickly (Within Reason)
The sales adage that time kills all deals is also true in the recruiting world.
In my experience, candidates view a speedy hiring process as a sign that your company is organized and on top of things, making them more likely to accept an offer. Even if the recruiting process is only a small reflection of your company, it’s one of the main insights candidates have into how your company operates.
Larger companies with hiring committees and multiple levels of approvals can move slowly when hiring, so for any startup or small company that doesn’t have a complicated process - use this to your advantage! Moving quickly will help you close candidates.
What it comes down to is putting yourself in the shoes of your candidates. Finding small ways to make your process less painful and more clear will go a long way in improving your candidate experience and increasing your offer acceptance rate!"

11,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2016/11/21/whyzihul9sgwyih4agpygzzrtpafxh,"Over the last few years, there has been a shift in the way that job-seekers approach finding new jobs. Where, before, most people sought out companies that were reputable and could provide a stable career ladder, people are now seeking meaningful stops along their self-directed career journeys - companies willing to invest in their learning and companies whose mission and culture they connect with.
As a sourcer, I spend my time looking not only for people with the right skill set for a specific role, but for people who are the right culture fit for an organization. That’s where my job gets particularly interesting and challenging.
Just as there’s been a rise in startups in search of top talent for rapidly scaling teams, there’s also been a rise in employees’ need for connection to their work. Books like Designing Your life, Purpose Economy, and The Quarter-Life Breakthrough reflect how important it’s become for us to find meaning in our work, beyond just having a job.
So, as a candidate, how can you take matters into your own hands and direct your own career journey? LinkedIn is a powerful tool, when used right, to help you find the best, next career opportunity for yourself.
Spending time to draw out your professional and personal sections on LinkedIn can help you connect with organizations and companies you might not have otherwise known about. A recent Gallup survey found that 6 in 10 (already employed) millennials are open to new job opportunities, and with the increase in sourcers and recruiters sending targeted outreach, you’ll want to make your profile stand out from the crowd.
Here are things you can highlight on your profile:
Scholarships, fellowships or research papers that you’ve written reflect different skillsets that may be valuable to startups or other companies that value specific areas of academia.
Volunteer or advisory work shows commitment - even if in an industry outside of your job. Especially if you’ve thought about pivoting to another industry or role that may not be directly correlated to what you’re doing now, this could be an eventual bridge that gets you there!
Hobbies or interests show off what you’re passionate about outside of work and can signal your intellectual propensity and curiosity - a trait that is often highly regarded.
Coursework from a university or organizations like Coursera, Khan Academy, or General Assembly can show a desire to learn and get out of your comfort zone. If you’re a digital marketer by day, but have always been curious about software development, show off those coding courses you took last fall.
Stating the specific industries or types of companies that interest you are an instant signal to anyone looking to build their team with individuals sharing the same passion they’re working towards.
Including examples of fun facts! Can you recite from memory the entire list of prior Kentucky Derby winners? Were you a magician in a former life? Are you training on the side to one day participate in the Olympics? These fun tidbits can be an instant conversation starter and help people remember your background.
Bringing out and highlighting other aspects of what you find meaningful can help sourcers and recruiters pinpoint your profile. It can help you standout from the hundreds of other candidates out there, and can even help you connect with other individuals with similar motivations or interests!

12,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2016/12/2/partnershipscaling,"When kicking off a new hiring initiative, one of the phrases that I hear most frequently from hiring managers is, “We need to hire this person yesterday!” As a recruiter, my response is always the same: challenge accepted.
Hiring Managers: I hear you. Your team’s success is dependent on hiring the right people onto your team. But especially in startups, employees are already swamped with their regular duties – and adding a time-consuming, yet critical deliverable on top of that can feel overwhelming. However, not treating the startup recruiting process like a part of your job is a huge missed opportunity – especially when you need to hire for an open role yesterday.
Changing the perspective on recruiting to one of partnership hiring can have a great impact on the hiring process, and on results. This involves ensuring that hiring is a shared responsibility where both the hiring manager and recruiter are active participants, with defined roles and responsibilities. This holds true both for internal recruiting relationships, where the hiring manager and recruiter are both employees of the company, as well as external relationships with an outside recruiting agency.
Improve startup recruiting by:
Tip #1: Define the role you’re hiring for.
This may seem fairly obvious, but you would be surprised how often a hiring manager relies on an outdated job description that does not accurately describe the open position or the skills required for success.
It’s helpful to make sure that the job description describes the skills that are necessary for success in the job - both those that would be nice to have, as well as separating out those that are critical to start with and those that can be learned.
Tip #2: Describe the ideal candidate.
The more clearly you define the ideal candidate at the beginning of the process, the easier it will be to measure the candidates you get against this standard. Paint a picture of the ideal candidate with as much detail as you can, considering questions such as: specific background, experience or expertise; companies to target or avoid; certifications or other proof of knowledge - whatever will help the candidate be most successful in the position.
Tip #3: Clarify who’s doing what.
One of the most difficult things about creating a partnership hiring process is deciding – and understanding – where different responsibilities lie. This can vary from one company to another, and even from one position to another; but without transparent assignment of responsibilities, it is very easy to drop the ball and unfortunately, to lose out on great candidates.
Some responsibilities that should be clarified include:
- Initial review of applications / resumes
- Secondary / technical review, if necessary
- Screening interview
- Follow-up
- Final (team or department) interview
Tip #4: Consider the team.
When asked, most people will tell you that the thing they love most about their job is the people. This is often the critical factor that makes candidates choose one job over others. It’s essential for your recruiter to have an understanding of the team from the outset – even during the initial review of applications. Understanding how to find the person who will add to the culture of the team and the organization helps to improve overall candidate quality. Some things to clarify at the outset include:
- Organizational structure of the team
- Team dynamic: cultures and personalities
- Role of the team within the company
- Existing team skills
Investing in a great partnership with your recruiter gives them the tools they need to better understand the role and adjust to your likes/dislikes/personal recruiting philosophy. This will help to streamline the recruiting process, find you the best possible candidates, and, ultimately, avoid wasting time and energy on candidates that are ultimately not the right fit for the role.

Thanks to First Round for continually providing such great data about the start-up community. This year’s report is even more informative than the first. There’s so much great stuff here, I encourage everyone to read it all, but here are my main take-aways to share with our community:
1. I appreciate the greater emphasis on diversity. I will weigh in on the side of the females on the root causes of diversity gaps, it’s not just that there aren’t enough women entering the field - the 61% of all-male boards is pretty strong evidence of bias as there are plenty of strong female leaders out there - especially when you think about diversity decreasing as the companies grow (!)
2. The data about equity is really useful, but speaking as a provider of comp data to many companies in the start-up space, I would caution possibly-alarmed readers that this survey is heavily skewed to earlier-stage companies. Series B, C or later companies couldn’t possibly sustain grants of this size, and their salary/benefits/equity mix changes accordingly.
3. Most important, glad to hear that hiring continues to be the #1 concern of founders and company leaders! As a founder myself, I sympathize with the challenges of finding the right talent. But since helping our clients build their engineering, sales/marketing and HR/recruiting teams is the dominant part of our business - this is clearly a good thing for Gray Scalable!
This is great information, Thanks First Round!

Samantha Feldman
The ‘gender in tech’ conversation went into full swing in 2014 following Google’s release of their diversity data. Firms large and small followed suit, and the message around women in technology was remarkably similar at each one: of the 20 companies that released this data point, not a single one reported more than 33% women, and 14 of the 20 didn’t crack 20% (that’s only 1 in 5 employees). Check out the graph below, and you can hover over the bars for additional detail.
Is this just ‘how it is’? The value of more diverse companies.
For every coworker who enthusiastically sees the inherent value of gender equality initiatives (and other forms of diversity in the workplace), there is another who grumbles ‘what’s the point?’ To start with the easy one, there is the financial reason, summed up best in a McKinsey study that looked at 366 public companies in 2014 –
“The companies in the top quartile for gender diversity were 15 percent more likely to have financial returns that were above their national industry median.”
This financial finding is also backed up here, here, and here (and these were within just the first five search results).
What may drive this financial success? This is summed up by best by Brian Welle, director of People Analytics at Google, in his video on unconscious bias at work:
“Complex decision making, innovation […] are better when we have diversity represented […]. And it’s not only the [diverse] person who contributes something unique - research shows that everybody else contributes something unique. You act differently in a diverse group than you will in a group of people exactly like yourself. You will overemphasize the qualities that you have in common when all of you are the same, and you’ll feel freer to express something that’s different when you have different people in the group.”
I think the go-to understanding when it comes to diversity is that the ‘diverse’ person is the one that brings the new perspective, and those in the majority learn from it. The argument made here is that it’s not just a one way street - having someone different in a room forces everyone to think differently.
At Gray Scalable, we find that creative and innovative leaders are thinking about diversity at ever earlier stages of development. Some companies are recruiting with an emphasis on gender diversity in engineering and other teams, as well as diversity of leadership, even at their first big investment growth phase. In our view, no time is too early to start, because it's much better to avoid the gender diversity issue than to have to fix the problem later.
Coming up, we’ll discuss the stats on women in leadership roles."

Women in Senior Leadership Roles
Samantha Feldman
A few years ago I stumbled across a Tumblr called Boys Clubs, which records website pages that feature 100% male representation – executive teams, conference speaker lists, boards of directors, and rankings/awards lists. While humorous, the nearly 20 pages of screenshots is also jarring – and proves the cognitive bias that when we think of ‘leadership’ we think of a male.
Along those lines, one of the data points released by many companies was the percentage of women in leadership positions. However, companies defined ‘leadership’ differently, with some reporting leadership as widely as “all people managers” and some defining it more narrowly as “VPs and above.” As a result, the numbers reported swing from 48% to 12%. Where this brings us to is the idea that the more senior you get in a firm, the lower the share of women.
In order to make a fair comparison about the percentage of women in leadership roles, I instead looked at each of the company websites to see who they choose to publicly feature to consumers and potential candidates as their leadership. A total of 269 leaders were featured, 58 of whom were women (22%). Below is a graph that shows the share of female leadership by company – hover over the bars for additional detail.
When it comes to leadership in technology, there were only two companies that released their data publicly that currently have senior executives listed in a technical position – the CTO at GoDaddy and interestingly, multiple roles at Intel (SVP of Data Center Group, VP of Platform Engineering, VP of Tech and Manufacturing, and CIO of Information Technology). Another interesting find is at Amazon, where the current odds of being a woman featured on website leadership are 1 in 8. The odds of being named Jeffrey are 3 in 8. In other words, it is three times more likely to have a senior leader named Jeffrey than to have a senior leader who is a woman. This is not too unusual of a finding – the New York Times published an article about a year ago with the title “Fewer Women Run Big Companies Than Men Named John.”
Another way of tracking female leadership is by looking at board membership. Of the public companies on the graph above, we again see this approximate 33% ceiling when it comes to board membership (the notable exception is Yahoo! where 43% of board members are women). The 3:1 name ratio repeats here as well - this time at Twitter - where there are three board members named Peter and only one female. That said, it’s through board appointments that we see that female representation has taken on greater importance in the past few years – of the 31 female board members counted, 10 of them (32% of all female board members in this group) were appointed in 2014 or later. This trend is reaching the start-up world as well – a couple of weeks ago it was reported that Kleiner Perkins held a meeting where they urged their portfolio companies to focus on setting up diverse boards.
While there is definitely no quick fix to this problem, companies can start adopting HR policies and corporate cultures that attract, retain, and provide growth opportunities for female leaders. Small start-ups are in the best position to do this, as it’s much easier to make a change in both culture and numbers when you’re at a hundred employees than when you’re over a thousand.
In the next article we’ll talk about one way to make a dent – with recruiting."

Featured Guest: Nick Malaguti
Nick Malaguti is a software engineer who specializes in developing a comprehensive understanding of intricate systems. He’s also interested in the leadership, management, and organizational structure of engineering teams. Nick worked with Gray Scalable on his recent job search.
When I started my career as a software engineer, I thought that writing great code was all it would take to rise through the ranks and become a top tier engineer. I had heard the myths of 10x engineers – the idea that the best engineers are 10 times as productive as their peers – and I assumed that choosing the right abstraction and writing fast, clean code would get me there. I was wrong.
A few years into my career, my manager told me that if I wanted to get promoted to the next level, writing great code wasn't going to be enough. She explained that engineering projects are too big for any one person to do alone, and so working effectively as a team is more important than any one person's output. Simply having the best idea, or writing the best code, wasn't enough. I needed to present my ideas in a way the rest of the team could follow and buy into. I was struggling with a human problem, not a code problem.
I used to think that management was of dubious value. If you think of software engineering as the process of turning ideas into code, why do you need people who don't write any code? I think a lot of young engineers start out not knowing what they should expect from management, and have no way to evaluate whether it is good or bad. If you don't think you have anything to gain from having management, and you've never seen it done well, it's easy to miss how much value it adds to an organization.
I compare management to code reviews or continuous integration; when done poorly, it is clearly a drag on the organization, and if you feel like you've been getting on fine without them, why take on the overhead? But anyone who has made the transition knows that once in place, you'll wonder how you ever got on without them. The same can be said for good management.
_______________
Earlier this year, I decided to join a startup. It was time to make a move and I felt that a smaller organization would be better for me. I also knew that I needed a strong manager and organization to help me level up my soft skills. Unfortunately, startups seem to hate management. From “flat” and “meritocratic” organizations to Tony Hsieh's Holacracy, many startups are actively exploring ways to excise traditional management altogether. Nearly every company I've talked to uses a flat organization as a selling point.
I've grown a lot while working on some exceptionally hard problems, but each time I thought I was ready to take on new challenges after leveling up technically, I found that weak soft skills often held me back. Successfully taking on the next order problem was as much a function of getting the architecture right as it was communicating with a wide range of stakeholders.
I realized that in order to have the kind of impact I wanted to have, I needed help growing my soft skills in tandem with my technical skills. I was looking for an organization that was ready to invest on both sides. It was surprisingly difficult to find.
What's a Flat Organization?
To me, a flat organization has two aspects (and companies can have either one, or both):
- a lack of layers of management between engineers and leadership
- a lack of hierarchy of titles and well defined career paths
Both of these are trying to solve problems that can arise when hierarchy or management are done poorly. However, I believe that hierarchy and management provide critical support that engineers need to grow and succeed.
Even flat organizations develop hierarchy
Titles serve a purpose: they can help employees identify leaders, provide a shorthand for responsibility, and give employees a sense of forward motion over a long career. Of course, titles are not always merit based, and excellent employees can end up under the thumb of someone who has simply been there longer and is better at office politics.
Also, if you're going to have titles, you need a way to identify who should have which title. This can be a lot of work, and is often hard to quantify in any meaningful way. Rather than waste effort on something that isn't going to be accurate anyway, some organizations opt to avoid it entirely. Or they allow engineers to pick any title they want. Who wouldn't want to be a Chief Jedi of Engineering?
Understandably, small, young organizations want to avoid these pitfalls. By removing titles and hierarchy, the best people and best ideas will naturally rise to the top - or so the thinking goes.
Just like scaling your product, it can be hard to know if or when to refactor your organization. Too early, and you add unnecessary overhead. Wait too long, and a lack of structure can be replaced by “shadow” hierarchies anyway.
Organizations that exist without titles or a hierarchy for too long often develop a “shadow” hierarchy instead. The hierarchy still exists, but it is difficult to see unless you live within it. It can hold you back just as much as an explicit hierarchy, except you have no recourse to say that the hierarchy has been perverted or isn't working as intended.
Even the best athletes have coaches
Why do startups dislike management? If we look at the traditional bureaucratic organizational structure, it's easy to see why. For engineers, lots of non-technical managers that don't appear to do much can actually get in the way of doing good engineering work. Distance from leadership can lead to a game of telephone where valuable information is lost. As an employee, there’s a lack of agency when someone, somewhere needs to approve every decision you make.
All these are valid fears. But there are ways to avoid some of these pitfalls without removing management entirely.
For a change in perspective, let's think about athletes. Even the best athletes in the world have coaches. Coaches provide insight, support, and have a wealth of experience in their field. Getting rid of coaches because they don't play the sport today seems like a foolish thing to do.
Just like coaches, management can add a ton of value. The best managers will help you manage your career, help you round out your skill set, provide feedback and recognition of your effort and impact, and take things off your plate that get in the way of doing your job. They will see things you can't, and have the experience to help you overcome new challenges.
Final thoughts
In my job search, the critical piece I was seeking was well defined career paths. I eventually found a startup with the right balance of organizational structure and focus on management. I encourage engineers and organizations to invest in management as a driver of growth and future value - it was a huge differentiator for me."

What are the biggest skill gaps among technical roles?
We’ve been fielding a lot of questions from our users on what skills are in highest demand. Luckily, we’re not short on data. So, we decided to explore the topic in more depth.
Before we dig into our findings, we’ll tell you how we got there. We based our research on approximately 500,000 resumes and over 13,000 open job descriptions with the goal of analyzing the top ""skill gaps"" among technical roles. To offer more clarity, we recognize “skill gaps” as skill keywords that appear proportionally more frequently in job descriptions than in candidate resumes. The data was scaled across 2,500 keys to identify the skills with the biggest differences between demand (jobs) and supply (resumes).
Okay, really, what is the trend?
Demand for skills associated with NoSQL technologies has clearly outpaced supply. ""NoSQL,” ""Redis,"" ""Hadoop,"" ""Cassandra,"" and ""MongoDB"" were among the top 15 scarcest skills. Interestingly, relational database SQL technologies such as “Oracle,” “MySQL,” and “SQL Server” are at a slight surplus. For example, we’re seeing skills like “MySQL” appear more frequently in resumes than in actual job descriptions. Intuitively, this may not come as a huge surprise: as companies are collecting more and more data, it’s likely many are switching to newer database technologies over relational database systems. They will need employees who can manage these systems.
Times are changing - and quickly! As Business Insider tells us, digital data is growing at an exponential rate, doubling every two years. Thus, there's also a major skill gap in the data science and analytics fields - where the objective is to make sense out of all this data. As data science becomes integral to all industries, we expect all departments within all companies to start requiring skills like ""Machine Learning,"" ""Data Science,"" ""Statistical Modeling,"" and ""Data Mining."" We’re already seeing the trend...
As candidates, how do we keep up?
1. Degrees and Bootcamps: An increasing number of universities are offering degrees and specializations that focus on the relatively nascent field of data science and analytics. For programs with shorter commitments, data bootcamps are a great way to get a solid foundation and practical experience in data science. We recommend:
2. Online Courses: MOOC's (Massive Open Online Courses) are becoming popular. There's no shortage of courses focusing on topics such as big data, data mining, and machine learning. We recommend:
- Coursera: Introduction to Data Science
- Udacity: Intro to Hadoop and MapReduce
- edX: Data Science and Machine Learning Essentials
3. Just Do It: If you already have some technical background, the best way to learn is to get your hands dirty. There are plenty of open data sources and packages with thorough documentation out there to get you started. Whether it’s forecasting real estate prices or building a recommendation engine for movies, choose a project that interests you. We recommend:"

One thing we’ve seen companies struggle with is “how do we recruit more female engineers?” At about the same time in planning for their open roles, hiring managers are debating whether to add that “must have computer science degree” requirement on the job description. Wanting both creates an interesting problem - if we look at the U.S. Department of Education data, we can see the share of women with undergraduate degrees in engineering has declined since the mid-1980s. The graph below shows women as a percent of the total bachelor’s degrees for that year -
So if a firm is looking for someone with a degree in computer science and 5-10 years of experience, the graph tells us that females made up less than 20% of all engineering degrees for all of those years. Looking at actual numbers – using 2011 as an example, there were about 8,000 women who received computer science degrees; and over 35,000 men. Companies requiring the degree may be making an already small pool of candidates even smaller.
As a result, teams may want to look at different educational backgrounds in order to achieve a higher gender balance or adjust strategy in other ways. This could include sourcing from a hacker school, utilizing job boards that are dedicated to diversity in tech, or attending a Grace Hopper event. For a longer term benefit, your team can also seek to build their network by getting involved with organizations that support the women-in-tech community. Extensively long lists like this are a great start.
The ideas above may help drive more female candidates to look at your job openings, but if you want them to both apply to your job and be successful in the interview, you’ll want to have a structure in place to remove bias from the process. How to do this?
Start with the job description. There’s plenty of research out there showing that the word choice in your job description affects who will apply to your job. Using more gender neutral words increases the chances you’ll attract a more diverse pool of candidates. Products like Textio can automate this process, and some examples of how to think about and re-word your descriptions can be found here.
Be Aware of Gender Bias. A great (if not alarming) recent study looked at over a million GitHub users and found that
“… code written by women was accepted 78.6% of the time and the code written by men was accepted 74.6% of the time. But when female coders indicated their gender, their code was less likely to be accepted: their acceptance rate plummeted to 62.5%. The findings suggest that women coders face a persistent gender bias.”
In other words, just having a female name on a resume may (unconsciously) lead your interview team to believe the candidate will be a less competent coder than a male candidate. An option to explore is adopting a gender blind hiring process, which leads us to -
Update Your Hiring Process. Airbnb recently did a case study on themselves as they realized there might be gender bias in their hiring process. They experimented by transforming certain stages of their interview process, and were able to grow the percentage of females on their data science team from 15% to 30%. One of the things they did was to remove potential gender bias from how they graded a take home test, a standard part of their data science interview.
“[…] we removed access to candidate names and implemented a binary scoring system for the challenge, tracking whether candidates did or did not do certain tasks, in an effort to make ratings clearer and more objective.”
This is a great example of a way to apply the findings from the GitHub study referenced above.
We’d love to hear from you – if you have implemented any strategies (large or small) that have worked for you, shoot me an email at sam@grayscalable.com. I’ll be writing a follow-up post on what’s been working."

The world of start-up HR has evolved a lot in the past few years, and the change has been dramatic from our vantage point as providers of HR consulting and recruiting services. Many companies are now hiring HR leaders earlier in their growth than they used to - instead of waiting until they approach the 100 person mark, they're recognizing they need specific expertise in people and talent sooner to scale up well.
And at the same time, the universe of HR, recruiting and management tools has multiplied 5-10x for small to medium companies. My team advises our clients on the best tools for the right stage of their business, and over time we’ve come to see the need for our own “Lumascape” of select HR products just to keep track of them all in a semi-organized way.

This blog post originally appeared on Upsider.co, a data driven careers marketplace for high performing salespeople. Upsider matches top salespeople to upside job opportunities using a unique combination of compensation, historical performance and sales environmental data.
Our guest blogger this week is Co-founder Drew Koloski of Upsider.
If you caught Silicon Valley on HBO Sunday night (spoiler alert), as soon as Gilfoyle (a software developer) half-heartedly quit, he updated his LinkedIn Status and was instantaneously bombarded with phone calls and showered with gifts from recruiters. I laughed out loud, because while that is mostly an exaggeration, recruiters will pounce on developers the second they sense one little thing is throwing them off at their current job.
Have you ever wondered why top developers are so much more discoverable to recruiters than top salespeople? Naturally with the skills gap debate front and center these days, you may attribute it to supply and demand, right? Well that is certainly part of it, but I think it has more to do with data and information… let me explain.
Until recently, I had spent most of my career building recruiting teams at startups and tech companies. Most of the time, the pressure was on and the majority of my team’s time was spent recruiting great developers. One of the things that makes sourcing and recruiting developers less of a headache than salespeople is you can actually start to find and identify data information about them before you make contact. You can dive in to find interesting bits of information about who is talented, their fit in your environment, the right niche skill sets and even how long it would take them to ramp up.
The reason you can uncover this information is due to the amount of data available on the social web. It’s pretty easy to find out what languages they code. It’s common to find a blog post with some interesting side projects, maybe one similar to what the team is building. There may be open-source projects with code on Github, you can grab one of your engineering leads to take a look. In fact, there are actually software platforms like Talent Bin andEntelo that aggregate all of this information automagically, and will send alerts too!
All of these data points start to connect to a story, which the recruiter can use in outreach to an engineer (unfortunately, not all recruiters take the time to research, which could be a whole other post). My point is, this data helps recruiters start to understand who is who. It helps them predict how the engineer may perform in their company’s development environment. There are indicators out there. Hiring teams can start to sense what separates one developer from another. Because they can start to think about them as individuals, recruiters can find the right narrative and spend more time convincing the developers that they are the right fit to sign up. The end result drives up demand for top developers with key skill sets, and they are rewarded for it.
The main differentiator when comparing recruiting top developers to recruiting top salespeople is the amount of data and indicators available to us when we search. Sadly, most sales candidates look the same on paper — there is no way to tell who is a top performer, who digs up 90% of their own leads, who has a similar sales cycle, strong team ranking, excellent win rate, etc. There is nothing available online to let recruiters know they want to spend their time courting you instead of every other salesperson on LinkedIn. Take a look at this image of four account executives’ LinkedIn Profiles, they all work for the same company:
I happen to have the numbers on these four salespeople, and one of them outsells the other three… combined! Yet, there is no way of recruiters knowing. What happens as a result, is “I noticed your excellent background in sales and….blah blah” aka — the same shitty recruiter-spam for everyone! Recruiters literally have to reach out to each and every salesperson at every company they are targeting with what is typically the same message.
This is a ton of painful work for recruiters, it sucks for salespeople, and it leads to a grossly inefficient recruiting life-cycle. It’s also a big contributor to a huge problem — the churn sales teams see every year. Here are a few charts from Bridge Group’s B2B SaaS Sales Survey in 2015 that highlight the churn problem:
Having the opportunity to recruit both developers and salespeople has given me perspective on this problem, and I’m excited to be working on a solution at Upsider. For the first time, we are making top performing salespeople discoverable in an anonymous fashion through the power of sales metrics and data. Companies hiring on our platform ask to connect with you based on an accurate and aggregated view your metrics based accomplishments, selling environment and compensation information — without your name or company information. It’s a targeted, efficient and safe way to get discovered and courted for your kick-ass revenue driving accomplishments! Plus, you’ll be in the driver’s seat — you can take a meeting to network without it feeling like an interview, and can politely decline if not interested and happy in your current sales job.
We’re hopeful we can start to solve the churn problem by helping salespeople and companies find each other at the right time, for the right reasons. Right now sales people are taking jobs based on time pressure and a false promise on the back end of a comp plan. On the other end, employers feel rushed and cannot always put the time and effort into the interview process and candidate experience.
After only four months in private beta, over 90% of the first introductions we facilitated for our Upsiders were accepted by our employer partners. This efficiency is helping employers take the time they need to build relationships with candidates. Furthermore, the Upsiders who have accepted new opportunities with our employer partners are seeing over a 30% increase in base compensation on average. Because these top performers fit the sales environment, and their outstanding performance history is presented upfront in numbers, employers have been happy to invest in their talent in a big way. Together with data, we at Upsider are really excited to get you the attention your success deserves and help you drive your career forward.

A couple of weeks ago we released a sneak peek of our start-up recruiter survey. We’ve now analyzed all the responses and compiled both our favorite insights as well as the full survey results!
Why Did We Launch this Survey?
While helping clients build their recruiting functions, we answer questions that range across the whole life-cycle of talent acquisition - how big should the recruiting team be? How many roles should they handle at once? How do I build my interview process? How long should it take to fill an engineering role? While our team’s broad experience has enabled us to provide good answers to these questions, we thought it would be great to start gathering more data to support our recommendations - and hopefully learn some new things ourselves.
Who Took The Survey?
51 start-up recruiters completed the survey.
Most of the companies in our survey (81%) are based in New York or Northern California. The companies were pretty evenly split in terms of size - just over half came from companies with less than 200 employees. The companies ranged in age as well, with about half under five years old.
A Few Insights
1. Recruiting Team Size. As one may suspect, we found that in general that larger organizations have larger talent acquisition teams -
Recruiters from organizations with under 50 people usually have just one recruiter (88% of start-ups).
Organizations appear to add a second or third recruiter somewhere between 51 and 150 employees, with 67% of companies having at least 2 recruiters by the time they are 100-150 employees.
By the time a company is over 300 employees, the majority of them have a team of six or more recruiters.
2. Sourcing Support. The majority of start-ups (79%) did not have a sourcer on their team. While it was mostly larger companies that reported having a sourcing function, there were a handful of start-ups under 150 employees that reported having 1 or more sourcers, suggesting that the addition of dedicated sourcers can be more of a subjective decision than a function of company or team size.
3. Recruiter Experience. Interestingly, we found that start-up recruiters were very rarely new to the job; 97% of them had at least three years of recruiting experience, 67% had over six - and 32% had over ten!
4. Applicant Tracking System. By a landslide, the most used ATS in our survey was Greenhouse.
5. Scoring Candidates. Our team often debates using a 4-point scale to score interview candidates versus a 5-point scale. Turns out almost half of start-ups responding only have a 2 point scale - yes or no!
6. Time to Fill. The time it takes to fill a role appears dependent on the type of role being filled; recruiters responsible for technology and product roles were more likely to report that it took them 3-4 months, while those handling business and sales roles were more likely to take about half that time (1-2 months).

At Gray Scalable we work with a lot of start-up recruiters. We’ve sourced, interviewed, onboarded, trained and supported start-up recruiters at dozens of clients. Last month we launched a survey to gain even deeper knowledge about how recruiting gets done at these companies.
We received over 50 responses from in-house recruiters at a diverse array of start-ups. These companies range in size - from under 20 employees all the way to ones that have grown to over 300 - and in location, with start-ups from New York, San Francisco, Boston, and London (among others) represented.
We’ll be releasing the full results soon, but here’s a sneak peek of a few things that jumped out at us:
How many jobs do start-up recruiters handle at once?
We asked: How many jobs, on average, are you responsible for at any given time?
Overall, 92% of start-up recruiters responding have less than 20 jobs open at a given time; 63% have 10 or less. Recruiters who reported they focused solely on technology & product jobs never carried over 20 roles; 68% reported having less than 10 open at any given time.
How many interviews?
We asked: How many people interview a candidate before he or she gets an offer? (including interviewing with a recruiter)?
Good news for interviewing candidates - only 2% of recruiters reported that it takes more than 10 interviews to make a hire. The remaining 98% were divided between 3-5 interviews and 6-9 before making an offer. As Google’s research has shown, after four interviews the incremental value of each additional interview levels off, so it may be beneficial for the 45% in the 6-9 category to consider shaving off a couple of interviews.
If you’re wondering whether company size makes a difference in the number of interviews conducted, we found that the larger start-ups (over 100 employees) tend to be the ones that conduct more interviews.
Focusing on Diversity
We asked: Is diversity one of your company's hiring goals?
90% of recruiters responding reported that diversity was a goal - but 75% of those said there is nothing formal in place in their process to achieve that goal.
While it’s great that the vast majority of companies are thinking about this, it’s hard to focus on diversity without some action items in place.
We wrote a blog post a couple months ago about initial actions companies can take - the post focuses mostly on women in tech, but it has links to a broad range of resources.

Back in 2012, I experimentally started a company with the goal of bringing leading HR practices to mostly HR-less start-ups, to help them bypass the turmoil they experience at certain predictable points. I had seen the patterns at several companies already and knew many of the solutions: goal alignment, structural clarity and career roadmaps, the math and science of people operations - but the tricky part was recruiting, since I knew that at least half of my business would be about helping clients scale their teams.
I wanted to work with companies as a third party, but operate as if I were part of the company - I needed total alignment. The agency recruiting model is full of conflicts of interest and bad competitive dynamics - I needed a playbook that would make my interests and my clients’ interests exactly the same. So “100% Alignment with Clients” drove the model and the relationships, and is still our first principle, that sets us apart and drives our decisions every day.
A year in, I also realized that while I had built a small group of great clients and was lucky enough to have the beginnings of my own scalable thing, I had also spent a lot of time doing things that had no obvious tangible benefit to my business - mainly because over the years I’ve connected to a lot of people and I like to help them out when I can. In my career, there were a handful of people who helped me out at important times, just to help me out, and I know how meaningful these professional acts of kindness can be. And while developing my business I met a lot of smart business leaders who weren't yet ready to be full-fledged clients, but just needed some advice - so I've helped them when I could as well. I’ve come to believe strongly that it’s a good practice to just do good things - and that the universe is appreciative and will eventually return the favor.
Over time it became clear that sure enough these acts of goodwill were actually leading to new clients, new candidates, new ideas, and ultimately new members of my team. Practicing Karma is playing the long game, and it’s been a critical part of our business model. I am convinced that if I’d been relentlessly focused on profitable work, we would not be where we are today.
So creating alignment, and good Karma, have driven our business. We are a values-first company in a true sense. Recently we’ve been working on refining and articulating our Team Values, which we’re now finalizing and will post in a few weeks. Stay tuned!"
25,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2016/7/28/shrodingers-cat-and-good-management,"At Google, we had mountains of recruiting data and we were able to use to use it to demonstrate the unreliability of any single interviewer’s judgement. We made a clear case that every hiring decision had to equally weigh inputs from 4+ independent decision makers with no knowledge of each other’s impressions until each had weighed in. This is the foundation of many companies’ interviewing practices and the core of the training we conduct with our clients at Gray Scalable.
The same science applies to good management. For any project, the more inputs the better, and any manager’s ideas are not going to be greater than the sum of ideas of his entire team. James Everingham at Instagram makes a fantastic case for how “...if you simply outline the problem and what success looks like—let’s say it’s increasing revenue by 100%—all paths to success are still possible, including those you haven’t thought of yourself. It’s very likely that someone on your team will think of a better solution, but as soon as you say what you think, everyone gets a whole lot less creative.”
So empower your people, and keep the cat alive. It’s not just “good for them”, it makes you all successful.

Whenever anyone (especially a candidate) asks me why I work in tech, a few responses come to mind immediately. I could say it’s because I like to be part of something that impacts so many people's daily lives, or that I’m inspired by the innovation and creativity that dominates the industry, or that I’m excited by the out of the box thinking that helps solve complex problems. All of that is true, but to be honest the reason that resonates most with me is a little more personal: I am incredibly grateful to working in an industry that promotes an inclusive and open culture, especially for those of us that identify as LGBTQ. Not only does this make for happy employees, but it’s also good business: 1 in 4 LGBTQ employees attribute staying at their jobs specifically to an inclusive environment.
Unfortunately this type of corporate culture is not the norm. According to a study by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), 53% of LGBTQ employees feel that they need remain in the closet where they work. The same study found that more than half said they regularly hear disparaging jokes about LGBTQ people at work, and 1 in 4 said they heard someone say something explicitly negative about the LGBTQ community. In fact, 31% said they felt generally socially unwelcome at work, and 35% felt they had to lie about their personal life. These are pretty sobering statistics, and in combination they add up to an environment that can make LGBTQ employees feel isolated, alone, and much less likely to succeed.
Recently, though, change has started to happen across the board and I’m proud to see the tech industry leading the way. According to the Corporate Equality Index for 2015, a report published by the HRC about LGBTQ inclusivity at the workplace, 21 tech companies got a perfect score - that’s the largest out of any industry in the country. When the legislature in North Carolina introduced an anti-LGBTQ bill, 68 tech companies publicly joined the HRC in taking legal action to stop it. You can regularly find leaders in the tech world marching at LGBTQ Pride parades across the country, and they are often some of the biggest sponsors. On a less public scale, tech companies were some of the first to offer benefits to same-sex domestic partnerships and to expand health care options to include gender transition.
There’s still a lot to do, but this is a start and I feel lucky to be a part of the industry that’s leading the charge. As a recruiter, I’m grateful to be able to connect candidates with opportunities and do
my part to actively build this exceptional community.

28,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2017/1/9/scalable-hiring-four-common-misconceptions-about-employee-referral-programs,"Scalable Hiring: Four Common Misconceptions About Employee Referral Programs
Employee referral programs can be a highly impactful part of a recruiting strategy; they provide a pipeline of candidates who come pre-vetted by those who already know what it takes to succeed at your company - your employees!
After running a referral program for a few years (and helping some of our clients update or launch their own), here are a few of the most common referral misconceptions I’ve seen:
1. More money means better referrals
Generally, referral programs will offer anywhere from $500 to $2,500 as a standard bonus for a hire (and sometimes up to 10K for engineering roles). When teams feel pressure to hire quickly, we’ve seen managers advertise a “double referral bonus” or other large amounts. However, in analyzing these campaigns, it’s usually the case that doing so only slightly increases the number of resumes submitted, and very rarely does it result in an increased likelihood of a hire being made.
INSTEAD: focus on keeping the referral program top of mind
One way to increase referrals without raising the bonus is to consistently promote the program and make it part of daily life at your company. This can be low tech - we’ve seen clients have a “wall of open jobs” where they post slips of paper with open roles in a highly visible area. Or this can be high tech - for example, investing in a platform that combines employees’ social media accounts and the company’s open jobs to suggest referrals for current roles.
2. Money is the only motivator
A cash referral bonus is not the only motivator for employee referral programs. In conducting focus groups with dozens of employees about why they make employee referrals, many responded that while the money was nice (and considered standard), their main motivation was usually a combination of helping out a contact, helping out the business, and/or gaining business credibility. This played out in the numbers as well - in one organization, about 40% of the referral hires were made by employees who were not even eligible for a referral bonus, suggesting that money is not always the main motivator.
INSTEAD: get creative with your incentives
That said, “cash” or “no cash” are not the only reward options. Great referral programs tap into their company culture to motivate employees to submit qualified resumes. At one of our clients, a “prize of the month” is raffled off - to get an entry, you submit a referral that is qualified enough for an interview (this solves the potential issue of having employees submit a high volume of unqualified resumes). Even if that person does not get hired, your name is put in the drawing. Employees have the ability to win things like company products, round trip flights, game systems, outdoor equipment, etc.
3. Employee referral programs are really simple
A referral program seems easy enough - employee submits candidate, candidate gets hired, employee gets bonus. However, there are a surprising amount of gray areas that surface once the program is running. Some popular ones are 1) an employee refers a candidate after the candidate is already in the interview process, 2) more than one person refers the same candidate, 3) an employee leaves the company before the referral bonus is scheduled to be paid out and 4) an employee with final say in the hiring decision seeks a referral bonus (e.g., the manager of the open role refers a candidate and knows they will receive money if they choose that candidate as the hire).
INSTEAD: make sure you cover your bases
When building a referral program, it’s worthwhile to think through possible issues like the ones above and decide what qualifies as a referral, and who is eligible to receive a bonus - and to publish these guidelines so employees can review them. Try to keep the language positive, and make sure your list of restrictions is not too extensive (no employee will want to participate if there are 20 qualifications listed to get the bonus!)
4. The more hires you make by employee referral, the better
Done correctly, an employee referral program is a great way to hire quality candidates, increase employee engagement, and keep recruiting costs down. However, there can be too much of a good thing. As a company, it’s usually good to shoot for 25%-40% of your hires coming from employee referrals (smaller start-ups will likely have much higher percentages). However, if you’re already at a couple hundred people and finding that 80% of your hires are employee referrals, the program may be serving as an avenue to “hire your friends” instead of “hire quality candidates.” In this situation, you also run the risk of having too homogenous of an employee population.
As with any people program, success depends on good program design, as well as participation from both senior leadership and employees. Whether you’re launching an employee referral program or looking to improve the one you have, these four elements will help you get you one step closer to some fantastic hires.

29,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2017/10/26,"Ahh the infamous cover letter (or ""cover emails"" in many cases). We get a surprising number of questions from candidates and friends about them. Does anyone actually read them? Are they necessary?
Unless you’re pretty early in your career or are an entry-level candidate, cover letters really aren’t a must, but it's also true that they can make a difference in some cases. For every hiring manager who skips over them there's another that thinks it's lazy not to have one. There really is no right answer here - a good letter can either help or do nothing, but a poorly written one can do damage to your candidacy. So, at the very least, if you do write one, you should make sure it's really good. Even if the writing process is uncomfortable and slightly annoying, here are some tips to make it impactful:
What's the point of a cover letter?
What does your potential future employer hope to learn from your cover letter - and why do they even ask for them?
A cover letter is a short, typically single page letter that employers often ask for in the hiring process along with a resume. Some employers ask for cover letters as a knee-jerk reaction: ""send us a resume and cover letter"" gets copied and pasted from job descriptions year over year. However, some ask for cover letters specifically because it's another way for them to evaluate your writing and communication skills.
A cover letter should go beyond what someone can read on your resume, and offer further insight as to why you would be a strong fit for the position you’re applying to. This is an opportunity for you to introduce yourself to an employer, to sell your best qualities, and to begin your argument as to why you would be the best person for the job. Use this as a chance to demonstrate your knowledge about the company and its products or services. Make it interesting, make it something that the hiring manager will read to the end.
In a cover letter you want to answer the big picture questions that tell hiring managers why you deserve that next step, typically an interview…
What questions should you answer?
A cover letter allows the writer to answer the question, ‘who are you?’ It gives you the chance to introduce yourself to the person reading it and it’s an opportunity to reach out as an individual, not just an applicant.
In a resume, you’ll share your skills and experience, and from that most people will decide if you’re actually qualified for the position. In a cover letter, you’ll answer ‘Why are you the best person for this job?’ Your answer should demonstrate what you know about the position you’re applying for and why you would be a great fit at that company. The resume is just about you; the cover letter is about you, the potential company and how you fit together.
The last question a cover letter can answer is simply ‘why?’ If you think anything on your resume warrants further explanation, or may make an employer question your abilities, (employment gap, lengthy time in school, etc.) you can use your cover letter to offer more detail.
Formatting tips
Keep your cover letter short. You'll lose your audience if it's more than a few, short paragraphs. You also want to make sure you’re maintaining a level of professionalism. This may change and vary depending on what career field you’re looking to work in. Use language that you are comfortable with and if you’re not sure, strive to mimic the level of formality the company displays on their website and careers page.
Keep your contact information consistent with what you have on your resume and make sure to include that information on both documents.
If you are 100% sure you know who will be reading the letter, address them by name. There’s nothing more boring and impersonal than receiving a letter that’s addressed to “whom it may concern.” Avoid being vague and generic, and tailor your cover letter to the specific job and the specific company you’re applying for.
And after all that, proofread. PROOFREAD. Proofread - Typos and incorrect information in a cover letter can do a lot of harm - and it's easy to avoid this kind of thing. You're looking to have your cover letter be something that differentiates you from other candidates and makes you stand out - not something that could make you look inattentive to details.
Ok, so you’ve written the cover letter, now what?
If you don’t hear from the company within a few days or about a week after submitting your cover letter and resume, follow up with them. A quick “wanted to be sure you received my application” email is an appropriate follow-up, include your name and contact information should they need to get a hold of you.

31,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2017/11/15/what-is-sexual-harassment-in-the-workplace,"Recently, we’ve seen a number of high-profile stories of pervasive sexual harassment at leading companies surface and gain media attention. These stories might only dominate the headlines for a little while, but they’re just the tip of the iceberg. The UN reports that 40-50% of women in EU countries and 30-40% of women in Asia-Pacific countries experience some form of sexual harassment in the workplace. In the US, a YouGov survey found 30% of women have been sexually harassed.
Women are overwhelmingly the victims of sexual harassment and so most of the stats we see relate to their experience. However, the limited data that’s available suggests LGBTQ people and people of color are also disproportionately affected. A smaller percentage of men are also harassed by women or other men.
While the victim’s experience of sexual harassment can range from uncomfortable to devastating, in the workplace there are also ramifications for the wider organization. The relationship between culture and sexual harassment is complicated, but with 98% of US organizations reportedly having sexual harassment policies in place, something is clearly awry in how culture is espoused versus how it’s experienced.
We need to talk about why this is the case.
Because sexual harassment claims are often settled behind closed doors, there’s little opportunity to understand and learn from what’s happened. Even if details are shared, people tend to focus more on the salacious detail than any lessons that can be learnt.
Privacy is essential, but organizations need to start having the tough conversations that can make change happen. We want to help start these conversations, so we’ve partnered with Nathan Luker from Your Call, a whistleblowing service provider, to deliver a series of articles on sexual harassment in the workplace.
We’ll cover the following questions:
What is sexual harassment in the workplace?
-
-
-
What are the red flags to look for?
How can a new CEO address a rancid culture?
The importance of defining sexual harassment
Before we even get to the definition itself, we wanted to start with why it’s important to have a shared understanding of what sexual harassment is.
Even when a definition is set out in black and white, cultural biases - particularly those stemming from a traditional view of the workplace as male-centric - can still impact how people interpret its meaning.
The Harvard Business Review tested this idea by asking a small group of individuals to read and then discuss a sexual harassment policy. They found that even though the policy clearly focused on specific behaviors of sexual harassment, the participants overwhelmingly felt that the policy focused on perceptions of those behaviors and therefore found it threatening. The participants believed it could cover any ‘innocent’ behavior by one employee (typically a heterosexual male) if an irrational person (typically a heterosexual female) perceived it to be harassment.
From a reporting perspective, being clear on the content of ‘sexual harassment’ can actually change how women self-report their experiences. The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission examined the findings of a range of surveys and found that when a survey specifically asked respondents whether they had experienced particular behaviors, like unwanted sexual attention or sexual coercion, rather than simply asking about ‘sexual harassment’, the level of reported harassment increased. In short, even women experiencing these behaviors as uncomfortable or offensive don’t necessarily label them as sexual harassment.
The point of these examples is that even when we think we’re on the same page, we’re often not. And this divergence can have major consequences culturally and individually.
Defining sexual harassment
The definition of sexual harassment in the workplace is the same as the definition for sexual harassment anywhere. The following definition is from the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC), but very similar wording is found in the US, UK and EU:
An unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favours or other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature which a reasonable person would anticipate would cause a person to feel offended, humiliated or intimidated constitutes sexual harassment.
It’s about behaviors
To really understand what the definition covers, we need to look more specifically at the types of behaviors covered. The AHRC gives these examples:
unwelcome touching;
staring or leering;
sexually explicit pictures or posters;
unwanted invitations to go out on dates;
requests for sex;
intrusive questions about a person’s private life or body;
unnecessary familiarity, such as deliberately brushing up against a person;
insults or taunts based on sex;
sexually explicit physical contact; and
sexually explicit emails or SMS text messages.
These are just examples and they all look incontrovertible on the page. Other behaviors that still amount to sexual harassment can be less obvious, perhaps delivered in a more subtle way. In these situations, perpetrators may excuse their behavior as flattering or flirtatious, while victims worry they’re rocking the boat unnecessarily. The fact is, if behavior of a sexual nature reasonably makes a person feel offended, humiliated or intimidated, then it’s sexual harassment.
Connected to the workplace
Workplace sexual harassment laws tie these behaviors to the employment context - which generally means every employment situation and relationship. The prohibition covers not only behavior in the workplace itself, but also work-related activities (e.g. conferences and parties) and basically all the interactions between people who work together.
The environment itself can also amount to unlawful sexual harassment where it’s sexually permeated or hostile. This could include a workplace where pornographic materials are displayed, or a culture where offensive jokes, sexual banter and crude conversations are the norm.
Who’s responsible?
The person who sexually harasses someone is responsible for the harassment, but employers can also be held responsible for the actions of employees. Having policies and procedures to create a harassment-free environment, and make reporting effective will help limit an employer’s liability, and can help reduce incidents.
In the next article in this series, we’ll look at why many (up to 80%) of sexual harassment incidents go unreported and some of the cultural and contextual factors that might be to blame."

Overcoming Biases: Thinking About Diverse Teams as Systems
This post was written by Jodi Jefferson. Jodi is Executive recruiter with 10+ years experience specializing in Engineering and Product search, providing strategic consulting for high-profile venture capital backed startups, growth stage, private and public companies. Broad experience in new business development, relationship management, advisory, talent development and recruitment of software engineers and product executives. The post was originally published by Jodi on Medium.
It’s been a busy year for diversity in the news. Since the Google Manifesto and the Uber debacle, it has become clear that even large, forward-thinking tech companies continue to struggle with diversity in the workplace. And yet there’s plentiful evidence that diversity is good for business, and most tech startups are eager to hire a more diverse workforce. But how do you accomplish this in a way that’s beneficial both for your company and meaningful for the people who work for you?
Understanding teams as systems
Diversity is a complex subject, and teams are complex systems. You need to understand all the necessary parts, why each layer is so critical, and how they all work together to achieve a common goal. In working to understand the diverse needs of your team, think of it as an operating system driving the function of a larger machine, in this case your company. In order for your machine to work properly, your OS needs to perform a diverse set of functions, such as scheduling tasks, executing applications and controlling peripherals. Similarly, a diverse team is like having a diverse set of tools that allows you to optimize for diverse problem solving, which will only make a system work better, be more resilient, with happier people and better products.
Building a better system starts with understanding why diversity is so important. Teams that comprise of diverse cognitive, gender, ethnic, age and socioeconomic diversity simply outperform those that are less diverse. HBS reports that “diversity can boost innovation and employee engagement. Companies with greater gender and ethnic diversity also financially outperform their peers. Diversity increases a company’s ability to attract and retain top talent, to better understand their users.”
Hiring for diversity
It can be tempting to immediately point to your recruiter or HR department and ask them to hire more women. In the last year, I’ve been increasingly asked what my “diversity initiative” is for nearly every executive search I embark on. As a recruiter who has specialized in building engineering teams for 10 years, this is not only my problem to solve. It’s all of ours; and this is not just about hiring more women (although that’s part of the solution). Take a close look at your team. How is it built out in terms of race, gender, LGBTQ, veterans, ethnicity, people with disabilities, income, education, and more?
As Uber head of diversity Bernard Coleman III notes, the first step to creating a diverse team is overcoming your own biases. “People often hire based off of familiarity and/or comfort, (i.e. someone who went to your program/college, looks like you, shares your interests or is a member of an organization you’re affiliated with).” Instead, consciously seek individuals with unique perspectives who come from different backgrounds. Find reasons to hire them. Make exceptions. This is not about “lowering the bar” to increase diversity — it’s about finding a different kind of talent for your team and honoring your differences.
Creating an inclusive environment
There is no shortage of stories (and hard evidence) that women and underrepresented minorities (especially in tech) experience bias and a general lack of welcoming environment. So once you’ve identified the gaps in your talent, consider what it takes to build it out accordingly.
Sure, I have a pipeline of female engineering leaders at my fingertips, but why would they want to work for you? What are you doing to prove your environment is diverse and inclusive? If you’re trying to attract a diverse subset of talent, start by asking yourself some questions:
- Can you overcome your own biases?
- What does your board look like? Is it ethnically diverse? How about your leadership team?
- Can parents of all genders raise children and progress in their career?
- What are you doing to create a more inclusive environment?
- Do you have a non discrimination policy in place?
- What part of your hiring process has diversity in mind?
- What does the interview panel look like? Are candidates meeting with a diverse set of individuals?
Take a long, hard look at your answers to those questions. Do you need to take steps to make your company more inclusive? If so, consider making some of the following improvements to your company (in addition to my suggestions above):
- Create gender neutral bathrooms
- Design employee resource groups to include women’s mentoring and leadership programs
- Support STEM initiatives and women in tech groups and events (e.g. Grace Hopper Celebration, Women Who Code, Black Girls Code)
- Offer gender-neutral paid parental leave that include adoption
- Add egg freezing services to your benefits
- Offer child care options for all employees
- Create breast pump rooms
- Be open to flexible work arrangements
Also, remember that that the root of inclusivity considers all people. Take a page from Denise Young Smith, Apple’s first ever VP of diversity and inclusion: focus on everyone, not just minorities. “Diversity is the human experience,” notes Young Smith. Once you understand your team as a system in need of a diverse set of tools, identify the gaps in your system and work to create a more inclusive environment for all employees, then you’re well on your way to success. Are you ready for a change?"

As an HR practitioner, I’ve observed that this is more often true than not. And as a consultant, I often help our clients create robust interview processes that evaluate candidates on many dimensions of compatibility, including how the manager and employee will mesh and work together, all to stave off turnover down the road.
It’s not just companies who want their new hires to stay for a long time - job seekers of course don’t want to be job hoppers. So, it’s equally important for companies and candidates interviewing to evaluate for compatibility on the front-end.
When I work with candidates - at all levels - I encourage them to view the interview process as a two-way street. Candidates should absolutely be interviewing their potential new boss and colleagues. There’s an art to it, of course - it can’t seem like you’re interrogating your new company, so you need to structure your own interview to ensure you’re finding out the things you need to know, in the right ways.
Start by making a list before you walk in the door. What do you want to learn from your conversation? What matters most to you? Your list may include finding out about what types of projects you’d work on, how your performance would be measured, what their general culture is like, and your potential manager’s management style. This might seem counterintuitive or even scary, to interview your interviewer - but it’s a worthy endeavor. Remember to know your value, and stay humble, and you’ll find that you’ll get a lot of the information you need.
But what about the things you can’t adequately learn about just by asking? For example, no manager, when asked about his/her management style, is going to respond, “So glad you asked. I’m a total micromanager!” You might be able to vibe if someone is extremely one way or the other on the micromanagement scale, but if not - you need another means to find out. This is where I recommend backdoor reference checking.
My team and clients know I have a healthy skepticism of companies doing backdoor references on candidates, unless conducted in the right way, and at the right time. The main reason I ask companies to hold on doing backdoor references is to preserve candidate confidentiality. But as the candidate, you’re in the driver’s seat. You decide whom you’d want to inform about your job search. This means you can do some backdoor referencing on the people you’d potentially work with and for. Here are some tips on how to do this right:
Do Your Research - and Choose Wisely
Use LinkedIn to see who in your network is connected directly to the people you’re talking to. You can then decide whom you’d trust enough to reach out to in order to learn about the company and team. Who you ask is at least as important as what you ask - remember to ask only those who would maintain your confidentiality. And ask people whose opinions you really trust - and who will give you an honest and fair assessment..
Time it Right and Keep it in Context
You’ll want to conduct your backdoor references late in the process - after you’ve had the chance to assess the opportunity for yourself, and when you feel like you’re pretty likely to get an offer. If they’re checking references on you, it’s a good indication they’re serious - and a good time for you to do your references on them.
If you do get a bad reference, make sure you keep it in context. Was the person who gave the reference laid off? Was their input colored by a personal conflict? Is the input years old? It’s good to take a trusted friend’s input seriously, but don’t forget to look at things holistically. A friend of mine reminded me that reference checking can be like deciding where to eat - you wouldn’t skip a restaurant you’ve heard great things about, just because of one bad Yelp review.
Speaking of Yelp...sites like Glassdoor, Indeed, and Fairygodboss can also be valuable tools, but definitely need to be taken in context (and I also think with a bit of a grain of salt).
Whether you’re an active or a passive candidate, remember that it’s not just about a company finding out about you. Trust yourself enough to evaluate the opportunity, primarily by what you learn in the interview process - and verify by leveraging your network.

A little more about our people analytics manager Sam, or, as our teammates call her, “Spreadsheetz”, or “sheetz” for short….
How she got into HR & people analytics:
Sam got into HR a few years after college. She started off as a conference event planner in financial services, which led to campus recruiting roles in both banking and media. From there, she moved into recruiting program management. All the while, her favorite thing to do was the tracking, analyzing and reporting for each of these positions, which (with the help of some great managers and mentors) led to doing people analytics work full time.
Sam rounded out her skills by getting a masters in analytics from NYU, which she finished this past spring (she’d like to also say thank you to her teammates for their support - and for celebrating heavily with her when it was finished!)
Any other jobs you’ve held?
Sam’s had a wide variety of jobs, starting in high school. Here’s a select assortment in graph form!
How she got to Gray Scalable:
Sam also opted to hand draw her answer here -
Sam’s role at Gray Scalable:
Sam joined Gray Scalable in August 2015. As the people analytics manager, she focuses on helping clients make better HR decisions using data, primarily focusing on compensation design, recruiting reporting, and survey analysis. She also spends a lot of time on internal operations projects and writes many of our blog posts.
Her favorite office pastimes are explaining herself with whiteboard graphs, trying to make it warmer in the office without anyone noticing, and wondering how early is too early for lunch.
Her favorite projects:
Sam’s worked with over 25 companies at this point, and it’s hard to pick a favorite client engagement. In lieu of trying to name favorites… here are some superlative awards:
Best View: Intersection and Cheddar
Best Snacks: Buzzfeed (frozen yogurt machine!)
Best Swag: Harry’s
Cutest: Bark&Co (puppies everywhere)
Cool Factor: The Players’ Tribune and Livestream
One of her favorite projects is actually an internal one - the annual recruiter survey. While procrastinating grad school assignments one weekend, she sent Charlie an email pitching the idea, and was off and running with it that week. The annual surveys have become some of our most visited sites and have helped companies understand how start-up recruiting works. Check out the results to this year’s survey, here.
What Sam’s up to now:
Sam’s currently working with two great clients (The Players’ Tribune and Cheddar), helping out with a few other companies, and working on some of our internal business operations as well.
When she’s not working, she enjoys exploring Brooklyn with her husband Steve, crossword puzzles, good bourbon cocktails, and anything produced by Ken Burns."

Gray Scalable has officially started operating in Los Angeles, CA. The new location is the first outside of our Silicon Alley headquarters in NYC, and we are building a team to cover clients throughout the greater LA area and the west coast.
“We thought carefully about where to expand our business outside of NYC - and the southern CA area is full of really interesting companies at stages of development where we can provide services with real impact for them. It feels a little like NY a few years ago in terms of tech community and market opportunity. Plus, Darla moved there,” says Charlie Gray, Gray Scalable Founder.
Adding a Los Angeles location gives Gray Scalable a physical presence in one of the fastest growing tech start-up environments in the country and where consulting and recruiting services are in high demand. The new location will be led by veteran talent acquisition professional, Darla Hornbjork.
For over a decade Darla has been assisting tech companies scale as they’ve grown. With expertise in hiring engineers, product designers, marketing and sales professionals to partnering with C level suite to define talent strategy, Darla brings extensive experience building sourcing pipelines, hiring, developing process and internal tools and defining employer brand strategy.
Darla is excited to get the ball rolling and says, “LA is no longer just for Hollywood! The tech scene is explosive and I’m so excited that Gray Scalable is going to have a chance at shaping this growth. I look forward to duplicating our reputation in NYC of being indispensable, respected and the in-demand partner for growth.”

Clubhouse is a project management platform that allows software teams to track their daily progress within the context of the big picture goals of your company. The product allows individual developers and teams the ability to filter all of the way down to individual tasks and it also allows the C suite to pull back and track high-level progress throughout the quarter and year, providing visibility into the engineering roadmap for all levels of the organization.
The story behind Clubhouse started at Intent Media, where Clubhouse co-founders Andrew Childs and Kurt Schrader watched the company scale from five to hundreds of employees. As they scaled, they saw their product management tools begin to fail to meet the growing needs of their engineering team. Andrew and Kurt set out to alleviate their team’s frustrations and improve the developer's experience with their existing tools, so Andrew built a UI layer to sit on top of their existing toolset. Tl;dr, it was a success and the team’s adoption made it clear that there was an opportunity in the market to turn it into a standalone platform.
“I think one big thing that we have tried to do from the very beginning is design the product so that every level of the organization can see what is happening. You can go from ‘what do I as a developer need to be working on?’ to ‘what are the 4-5 things we are building this quarter and how are we doing?’ We want everyone to be able to just do their work.” - Kurt Schrader
Clubhouse’s product has resonated so well with their clients that they have been able to scale to over 700 paying customers simply through word of mouth. Unsurprisingly, word of Clubhouse’s product reached the ears of Battery Ventures who approached the team to discuss investing in the product. Clubhouse announced earlier this week that Battery recently led a $10M series A.
Following their raise, Clubhouse approached Gray Scalable to help them grow. One of the most rewarding things about our model at Gray Scalable is getting to work with teams that haven’t yet had formal recruitment support. At Clubhouse, we get to work closely with Andrew, Kurt and the team to help build the recruiting function from the ground up. From sourcing & recruiting strategies to designing interview training, interview processes and hiring matrices, we get to do it all! To top it all off, the team is just as excited and eager to partner with us, and have proven themselves to be dream partners!
Right now, we’re working with them to grow out their engineering team. We’re on the search for a Senior Front End Engineer, Senior Clojure Engineer, as well as a Senior iOS Engineer. As a Senior Front End Engineer, you’ll get to help do things like design and build out new features and data visualizations, help build out the front end architecture and help the team continue setting up a robust testing infrastructure. On the other hand, as a Senior iOS Engineer, you’ll get to work in React native as the second mobile engineer to help continue shipping new features, all the while helping the mobile app move closer to the functionality of the web app.
At Clubhouse, you’ll find that the team is incredibly down to earth, humble and friendly! There is a ton of collaboration, as half of the team works remotely - so being able to work effectively whether you’re at the office in Union Square or working from home is really important. The company is at a compelling point in their journey where their product has clearly proven itself, but they’ve got big goals for their future. Anyone joining the team has an opportunity to make a meaningful impact in their individual roles and on the company.
Our experience at Clubhouse has been nothing but positive and we hope to partner with them long term! It’s clear that in the world of project management tools and platforms, many have tried to solve what continues to be the same pain points, but it’s clear that Clubhouse is onto something remarkable, and we can’t wait to see where they’re at in a year!

I once heard there are two types of people in this world; those who need coffee and those who need more coffee. Well my issue has never been waking up or staying alert. In fact, I’ve always been 'too' alert (I notice everything). Dug, (the dog from “Up”) and I are similar in more ways than I’d like to admit, but especially in the “inability to stay focussed for long” category.
A former manager of mine introduced me to a technique that helped tremendously. The Pomodoro Technique, invented by developer, Francesco Cirillo, is essentially an interval system for your operating rhythm. Break down your large tasks into smaller, timed intervals and build breaks in between.
The idea is to zero-in on a singular task for 20-25 minutes then take a 5-minute break to go grab a snack, scroll thru social media or finally contribute to that group message with your friends who clearly aren't ever as busy as you seem to be (you should introduce them to this technique!).
Results may vary based on workload, so experiment until you find a work-to-break ratio that’s best. Since adopting the method, I have become much more organized and efficient in my day to day.

38,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2017/2/1/visualizing-employee-compensation,"All graphics below are based on simulated data
One of the most important things a start-up can do is set up consistent pay practices that are benchmarked against the market. It helps growing organizations attract, reward, and retain talent - and feel confident they are doing the right thing for their employees.
Answering the “are we paying people correctly?” question is one we hear from a lot of start-ups. And of course, ‘correctly’ can take on many definitions; it can mean aligned to a specific percentile of the market, rewarding high performance, paying fairly across genders, etc. Benchmarking salaries and creating compensation ranges are a common exercise we do for clients to answer this question.
Visualization: the Dot Graph
Once this work is done, an impactful way to understand your organization is to see everything in one visual. An example is below, a graph our clients have referred to as “the dot graph” -
Here, every employee is represented by a dot. It’s easy to observe that for the most part, employees in this organization fall healthily within the salary bands, but one area to check out is Level 4, where the majority are falling below the middle of the range. It could be that these ‘dots’ are underpaid, or that they’re mis-leveled, or they need to be in the salary band of another job function. In any case, it helps you pick out where your next level of examination needs to be.
Visualization: the Spreadsheet
In addition to an overall visual summary, you can also look at salary data at the employee level. When companies give promotions, merit increases, or are thinking about making market adjustments, it’s valuable to understand how an increase to salary impacts an employee's position in their market salary range. Below is a way of visualizing this as part of an excel file.
In this case, the video shows that changing the “test salary” will change the salary band visual. The closer the gray bar is to the end of the cell, the closer to the top of the salary band.
Visualization: Equity
In addition to base compensation, we often work with employee equity. As with base salary, equity is part of a compensation package that can be used strategically to reward and retain employees. The visual below shows how vested employee options are across the company, and can be used to aid in deciding a retention grant strategy -
This graph separates out high performers, and shows that that only a few of them are nearing or more than 50% vested. However, ‘high performers’ in this graph could be swapped for any category of employee that decide you want to retain as part of your strategy - hard to find skillsets, senior leadership, or employees that are critical to the organization.
In the end, there are many factors to consider when thinking about employee compensation, but data visualization can be a helpful tool to help you synthesize all the numbers, understand trends and patterns, isolate outliers, consider different options - and ultimately to make more informed decisions.

39,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2017/5/25/talking-about-comp-the-rules-have-changed,"Talking about Comp! The Rules have Changed
In October 2017 NYC employers will change the way they talk about compensation with their candidates. This month, Mayor Bill DeBlasio signed into law the bill that bans employers from asking candidates about their salary history. This means that employers can no longer ask about base salary, benefits or other forms of compensation in the hiring process - a standard first round interview question for many companies! Interviewers can continue to discuss objective measures of the applicant’s productivity, such as revenue, sales, or other production reports.
How do I know what to pay people without knowing what they currently make?
At Gray Scalable, we recommend focusing on the requirements and scope of the role, and backing up your pay decisions with research and market data. One you've determined the salary range for the role, previous pay becomes much less important, and you can focus on assessing their fit for the job requirements. If they're qualified and can do the job, you can pay them within the predetermined range.
But what about that compensation conversation?
We really believe this new legislation is a good thing on a lot of levels - and in terms of the conversation, it will free you up from that ""who shoots first"" awkwardness of asking what someone makes versus disclosing the salary range. So what do you do?
First of all, if you have a recruiter or HR pro on staff, they should be the only ones on the hiring team who broach the conversation. If not, decide as a hiring team who will be the designated lead for this conversation, and make sure that person has reviewed the law and understands the dos and don'ts.
So...what can I say?
Put the candidate at ease. Tell her that you're interested in knowing her thoughts about compensation. Ask questions like, ""As you think about your next move, how do you think about compensation?"" ""Are you targeting a certain number?"" or ""What elements of compensation are important to you?"" (thinking about base, bonus, options, etc).
Be prepared to share pay information and set expectations. If the candidate doesn't want to share her thoughts about pay and turns the question around to ask about how you'll pay, that's totally fine and within her rights! You can either get specific and provide a range, or simply reassure the candidate that you'll be paying fair to market, and that there is a range for the position that she will be evaluated against relative to other peers in similar jobs.
Guide the conversation. If the candidate voluntarily shares her current comp package, acknowledge the information but redirect the conversation back to, “What are you targeting for this position?” That information should be shared with the recruiter/hr/comp lead person on the team but otherwise kept confidential.
What about Sales People?
A big measure of how successful a seller has been in the past is how they've performed against their targets. There are business-related exceptions of course, but it's a good rule of thumb is that good sellers consistently meet or exceed their targets.
The good news here is that it's actually OK to ask about this, as performance against targets qualifies as an objective measure of their productivity. It's a fine line to walk, though, so when you do talk about it, we suggest the following:
Set expectations. Tell the candidate the base/commission split of the role, and anticipated on-target, total earnings. Tell them how targets are set and how performance is evaluated.
Ask them the same at their current org. Ask about the candidate's commission while talking about their personal performance and successes - and don't ask about their base or draw. Questions to ask include, ""how did you perform over the last 3 quarters versus your goal?""; ""what was your quarterly goal and was was your percent-attainment to goal?"" ""How is your performance measured, and how does your commission follow that?""
Why this really is a good thing.
While this is an adjustment for NYC companies, we think it's a great positive step toward solving the systemic issue of gender pay disparity and we are excited to see the impact.
Ensure your team is informed about this legislation, and consult with your attorney for any legal questions."
40,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2017/5/31/why-being-the-companys-first-recruiter-is-the-hardest-job,"We help a lot of startups find one of their most critical hires: their first recruiter. Every growing team, by the time they reach 25+ people, realizes that finding the right talent in tech companies is surprisingly hard work. It’s very time-consuming and pretty expensive - and they need to hire someone to manage their hiring full-time.
Half of Gray Scalable’s value in these searches is finding the best person to be the first recruiter at a startup. But the other half is helping to set the stage for this hire, defining the boundaries and necessities of the job, and helping to set them up to succeed once they start. It’s tricky and a lot of “first-time recruiters” don’t even last a year in the job.
Four challenges to being the first recruiter:
1. Expectations are way off, and it will take you a year to correct some of them.
Some hiring managers will think you can hire people in three weeks. Others think you’ll only need to offer 50-80% of the salary the market pays for certain types of hires. It’s going to be an uphill battle to get your managers to align their expectations with the challenging truths of the tech talent market. To avoid this, ask a lot of questions on the front end, and set expectations fairly when you start--also, as you get up to speed and measure progress, learn how to use and report historical data to predict results and establish the right resourcing needs over time.
2. You don’t have a coordinator.
In startup recruiting, the first Recruiter is only half Recruiter; you’re also half Coordinator. You’re also your own Sourcer--you have all three jobs and can’t do any of them as well as you’d like. You may not get another resource right away, but once you're fluent with your internal recruiting math and once you build your credibility, it’s pretty easy to demonstrate the ROI of these hires.
3. “Who?”
Some companies get great candidates applying on their website, but the company that’s only 25 people hasn’t yet thought about their employment brand--much less taken steps to create it and make it known to the world, which takes time.
Building an employment brand might be another of your jobs. What to do: This is well worth spending time on, even though your time is scarce. Seek out cross-functional partners (maybe in marketing) - a strong employment brand helps the company in many ways.
4. Even though you save a lot of money, you seem like you spend a lot of money.
“LinkedIn Recruiter costs what!?”
“I thought we wouldn’t have to pay those agencies anymore when we hired you.”
“Let’s just track things with a Google Doc for now….”
You need to learn how (and when) to ask for the necessary resources and create a budget, choosing priorities wisely so you can have quick quality results plus a solid plan for longer-term hiring volume. Work with your hiring managers or executive team to establish the right success metrics for your job and build a plan to meet those targets.
Despite these first-year challenges, it’s an exciting and rewarding job building a company’s talent function. It feels great to look around and see the impact you’ve had at every company meeting; few employees can witness such a tangible impact from their work. And if you follow these steps, year two should be much better!

Parental leave has been top of mind for us lately at Gray Scalable (shoutout to our three newest & most adorable additions to the Gray Scalable family - Elle, August & just this week - Isabel!).
Clients ask us all the time for guidance on creating and improving their parental leave policies. With the U.S. being one of only TWO countries in the world that does not legally require paid leave for new mothers (the other? Papua New Guinea), we have a lot of work to do to. Some cities and states are starting to catch up and require partial or fully paid leave (note: many of these are funded by employee payroll deductions).
You might be thinking of revamping your parental leave policy, or maybe you have your first-ever pregnant employee. What now? Here are the questions we take our clients through when considering how to structure their programs:
How many weeks of paid leave is standard?
The average: We reviewed over 250 companies on the site fairygodboss.com, and among tech and media companies, the most common amount of time to offer for paid leave was 12 weeks. And among the better known companies we looked at, we found that they are either drawing the line at 3 months (12 weeks) or 4 months (16 weeks).
These numbers did not seem to be based on whether the company was public or private, the percentage of female employees at the company, or the amount of funding they have received (if they are a start-up). So, If you want to remain competitive in the market, we’d recommend starting here!
We’ve created some interactive graphs for you below to show these points. Click on the gray boxes to see the different graphs -
(Keep in mind your legal obligation: if your company has 50+ employees, eligible employees receive 12 weeks of unpaid leave, including their regular benefits. Check out the Family and Medical Leave Act for eligibility information. Note: your city/state may have additional requirements and short-term disability can cover part of a biological mother’s salary for 6-8 weeks.)
Above average: Those extra weeks may just pay their weight in retention gold. When Google increased its paid maternity leave from 12 to 18 weeks, the rate at which new mothers quit fell by 50%. It’s no surprise - the more time and freedom parents have to bond with their baby without the pressure of returning to work, the more ready and refreshed they are when it’s time to jump back in.
Above & beyond: Plenty of companies out there, like Spotify, Etsy, American Express, Twitter, and Adobe offer 5-6 months, and Netflix famously takes it a step further to offer a full year of paid leave to all new parents.
There’s no one right answer - it’s all about what your company is looking to get out your parental leave policy.
Maternity leave? Parental Leave? What’s the right terminology?
Traditionally, companies use Maternity Leave and Paternity Leave when they offer different leave plans for mothers and fathers. Keep in mind that families come in all shapes and sizes! For this reason, many companies now refer to their separate plans as Primary Caregiver Leave and Secondary Caregiver Leave, allowing employees to choose how these roles apply.
Others, who provide the same plan to all parents, use terms like Parental Leave or Family Leave.
Who’s eligible?
You’ve got some choices to make here, knowing that babies arrive in all sorts of ways. A growing number of companies are offering the same leave policies to new parents, regardless of whether the employee delivered the baby or the baby arrived through surrogacy or adoption. Companies like Netflix, Facebook, and Etsy offer the same plans to all new parents, no matter how their new family member arrived.
In some cases, like at Google and Adobe, employers have three types of leave plans: for biological mothers, primary caregivers, and secondary caregivers.
What else is there to consider?
Whether you’re looking to have the most stellar family benefits out there, or are looking for ways to boost your current leave plan, there are a lot of benefits to consider beyond how many weeks of paid leave you provide:
Paid leave before birth: Companies like Microsoft, Apple and Amazon offer additional paid time off for expecting mothers to rest and prepare for their new family member.
Transition back time - Recognizing how challenging the abrupt return can be, some employers, like Netflix, Spotify, and Greenhouse, allow flexible schedules for employees during their first several weeks back at work.
Staggered leave - Companies like Greenhouse and Netflix allow employees the flexibility to break up their parental leave into weekly or monthly increments (we recommend steering clear of daily increments).
Stipends: Companies like Facebook, Google and Yahoo offer stipends, ranging from $500 - $4,000, to help with expenses for each newborn.
Childcare - Offering free memberships to childcare services like Urbansitter is a simple way to support parents.
Internal support networks - An amazing and important consideration that costs nothing - creating an internal network for new parents to share tips, ask for advice, and just swap stories - many companies, like Greenhouse, Etsy and Twitter, have found creative ways to do this.
So how do you craft the right leave program for your organization? There’s certainly no one-size-fits-all answer, and there are a lot of considerations (including what you can afford - both the cost of your program and the more intangible cost of how it affects your company culture, inclusion, and retention).
Parental leave is just one part of the portfolio of benefits your offer your employees. We recommend starting by talking to your employees and getting a pulse on which benefits they value most.

Eric Holder’s report on Uber was released last week after months of investigation into Uber’s workplace practices. There’s been both praise and criticism for the 13-page report, which is high-level in its recommendations, and lightweight in assigning responsibility for the scandal.
In many ways it’s surprising that a company of Uber’s size lacked basic HR policies, but Uber is also a true startup - just three years ago the company was only 550 employees, much smaller than the 12,000 employees it has today. It’s challenging to have an effective HR function with that kind of growth, and only a matter of time before a company like Uber drew criticism for bad workplace practices. In a larger sense, the tech industry has some progressive perks and benefits, but has also been under fire in the past few years for its machismo culture and exclusion of diverse groups.
Uber’s scandal and the subsequent Holder report are good reminders of the best practices all tech startups should ascribe to, regardless of size or stage. Here are three takeaways from the Holder report:
Culture starts with the C-suite
Travis Kalanick, like many startup founders, surrounded himself with like-minded executives over the years. This is not unusual or even discouraged for small startups, as the first employees a founder hires usually come from their immediate network.
Executives set the tone and expectations of the company’s culture and Kalanick’s “A-team,” an internal name for the slew of early employees Kalanick relied on, established what became Uber’s current culture, with its now-apparent downsides. It’s generally understood that diverse viewpoints bring better workplace practices, and it’s well established that diversity brings new perspective and better financial outcomes to a company. More broadly, if those at the top model good behavior, others will follow.
Does this mean that startups shouldn’t hire like-minded people from their networks? Certainly not. At the smallest stages, hiring from a founder’s network is often necessary to hire anyone at all. Hiring is challenging enough for tech companies with brand names, and near impossible for the seed-stage startup with a handful of employees.
That said, keeping an eye on the c-suite’s make-up just makes sense as a company grows. Leaders need to hire people that challenge them, not just people who follow them or think alike. Hiring outsiders not only helps avoid problems like Uber’s, but is often necessary to tackle new markets and verticals effectively. Many of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies brought in outside executives to see their company through critical periods and became more successful for it.
Design culture, don’t just let it happen
Of course, founders are not the only people that influence company culture. Company values, team building activities, perks and benefits can have significant impact on diversity measures. Policies (or lack thereof), as well as the perks that a company chooses to highlight sends subtle signals to the team about what the company deems important.
Uber’s values such as being obsessed with the customer, making bold bets, toe-stepping and principled confrontation clearly outline a culture favoring employees unilaterally focused on hitting business goals, even if it means hurting others along the way. Uber’s values are an extreme example, but the point is important - if cultural values and other perks and benefits aren’t written without a diverse group or diversity in mind, they’ll be reflective of the wants and needs of the people who wrote them.
Another focus of the report was on some of Uber’s perks and team building activities. Holder suggested moving up catered dinner to an earlier time, limiting alcohol at team building events, and accommodating employees who need flexible work arrangements. Again, what works at a small startup won’t always work as a company scales. Dinner at 8:30pm and frequent happy hours may make sense for an early-stage startup where employees work 60 hours a week, but becomes a barrier to retaining diverse employees as a company of thousands.
The point is to think critically about designing company culture and continue to revisit and iterate on the culture as the company grows.
No company is a meritocracy
The meritocracy myth is rampant in tech, and it’s not hard to understand why. Shouldn’t we eschew workplace politics and simply let the best rise the to top? It’s a noble idea, but one that systematically oppresses women and minorities. Paradoxically, research shows that people who think they’re unbiased when evaluating hiring, promotions, and performance are biased like the rest of us, but fail to acknowledge and adjust for their biases.
Uber, along with many other startups, expected that an exclusive focus on meritocracy would bring them a workforce and leadership team made up of the best employees, regardless of gender or ethnicity. The reality is that pure “meritocracy”, in the absence of any other important considerations of diversity, leads to a workforce representative of our implicit biases.
Holder’s recommendations for establishing sponsorship programs, revamping performance review processes and establishing mandatory trainings for managers are measures to understand and account for implicit bias. Understanding that no company is as simple as a pure meritocracy is the first step and establishing processes and trainings to acknowledge and counteract bias is important to ensure women and minorities participate in the growth of an inclusive, strategically nimble and culturally strong company.

After years of working with great engineering teams, some of their Agile practices have rubbed off on me and I’ve applied them to how I recruit, organize my work and manage my teams. I’ve also learned a lot from Jim Benson about the sanity-keeping powers of a good Kanban board.
Below are several key Agile practices/philosophies that I’ve adapted to fit my needs as a Recruiter and Manager. While they are relatively simple concepts to understand and appreciate, they can be difficult to implement.
Follow the KISS Principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.
How does this apply to recruiting?
Simple, repeatable processes that result in the RIGHT hires. The process we typically follow for Engineering recruiting is as follows:
Recruiter Phone Screen
Technical Phone or Video Interview w/ Engineer (w/ some time allotted for behavioral/competency assessment)
A second Phone/Video Interview will happen if the candidate is non-local or if first interviewer is truly on the fence
Onsite Interview: 4 interviews (all in one visit) that each focus on a different topic. Typically, the breakdown is coding, algorithm (or a second coding question), design and behavioral.
Important note: all interviewers should have enough time scheduled so they can answer questions and sell the candidate.
Interview Team Hiring Decision
While my current focus is mostly on engineering, I’ve recruited for just about every role under the sun and I can tell you from experience that a process of this length and form can work for any role. For non-engineering roles, the technical phone interview should be an interview focused on assessing the skills needed to do the job. Early in the process, you shouldn’t over-index on assessing “culture fit.” Make sure the person can do the job and THEN figure out if they would excel in your particular work environment.
For this system to work well, the interviewing team must be well-trained and aligned, they must be asking the right questions and, last but not least, the recruiter must be well-calibrated (via constantly working with the hiring team to refine targets and filters.)
Final note: Depending on the role, a take home case study/test may be useful at some point in the process.
Kanban (Visualize Your Workflow)
A Kanban board is a work and workflow visualization tool that enables you to optimize the flow of your work. Typically, the workflow stages of a Kanban board are drawn on a whiteboard and work items are written on post-it notes and then moved through the stages. Trello is essentially the digital version of Kanban.
In its simplest form, a Kanban board looks something like this:
How does this apply to recruiting?
Candidate Tracking
Coordination Tracking/Prioritization
Work Prioritization
I’ve used both whiteboards and Trello to track candidates moving through the process and both have proven effective for keeping “live” candidate activity visible to the necessary stakeholders. Some people preferred having a giant whiteboard to check whenever they walk by and others preferred pulling up a Trello board to review. Perhaps the biggest benefit of visualizing your candidates in process is being able to spot pipeline problems before they become crises.
The coordinators I’ve worked with have found using a Trello board to visualize/track their work to be incredibly helpful. Beyond giving Recruiters an easy line of sight into where candidates are in the coordination process, Trello has proven most valuable as a way to objectively prioritize coordination work across a team. For example, if a coordinator is supporting multiple recruiters, having a system that allows each recruiter to label their requests with different priority levels allows the coordinator to manage their workload by always focusing on the most urgent tasks first instead of processing requests chronologically.
Finally, I always keep a personal Trello board(s) going to track and prioritize my work and team projects.
Limit WIP (Works In Progress)
A WIP limit can help you focus on correct decisions, completion, and quality. Limiting the amount of WIP improves throughput and reduces the amount of work ""nearly done"" by forcing you to focus on a smaller set of tasks. A Kanban board is the best way to visualize and prioritize WIP.
How does this apply to recruiting?
Applying a strong filter at the top of the funnel: focus on quality, not quantity. (This is one of the places where a well-calibrated recruiter comes in most handy.)
Keeping each of my team members focused on a manageable, well-defined set of roles.
IMHO, the “it’s a numbers game” mentality often attached to recruiting success is due to the fact the many recruiters and hiring managers aren’t well calibrated. In my experience, it’s possible to meet your hiring goals without making your recruiting or interviewing teams spin their wheels on an excessive amount of unqualified candidates.
Keeping recruiters focused on a manageable, well-defined set of roles (ideally within one department/business area) means they become domain experts and strategic partners.
Kaizen (Continuous Improvement)
Kaizen is a long-term approach to work that systematically seeks to achieve small, incremental changes in processes in order to improve efficiency and quality. Nothing too mind-blowing but, like the other practices listed here, it’s easier said than done.
How does this apply to recruiting?
The aforementioned well-calibrated recruiter who, again, must constantly work with the hiring team to refine targets and filters.
Iterating on all of your processes as needed. Always look for ways to improve efficiency, effectiveness and the candidate experience.
The degree of hiring success you will have is largely dependent on how well you can adapt and improve in these two areas, and being successful in both requires a hiring team and recruiting team that are aligned.
I’ve been most successful when the hiring manager is ready and willing to partner with me on both strategy and execution. Of course, I had stay on top of trends and data in order to bring solutions, new ideas and feedback to the table. That’s the only way to maintain a strong recruiting partnership that allows for continuous improvement to occur.

A little more information about Aja, our Principal Human Solutions Consultant and People Team Builder
How she got into HR:
“I owe my HR career largely to a Craigslist posting and a really bad phone interview! I was studying abroad in Madrid and needed to land a summer internship. I applied to everything HR related (I was majoring in IO Psych and knew that's what I wanted to do) and within a day had a phone screen scheduled with Razorfish. I had no idea what the company did and could barely hear the questions but somehow landed the job (mostly because the head of recruiting and I had gone to the same college). I started that summer and ended up staying for almost five years. It may be the most influential phone call of my life and I only heard half of it!”
Aja’s role at Gray Scalable:
Aja specializes in building HR functions for our clients, which includes everything from strategy, program and policy development, and hands-on execution to building out people teams for our clients. As manager of our HR services team, Aja is responsible for continually developing and improving our client HR offerings . Personally, her focus is creating and delivering customized training programs, including: management training, interview skills, coaching and building high-performance teams.
Aja is both People Artist and People Scientist. Her organizational intuition is always reliably perceptive, yet she knows better than to act from gut instinct; she understands how to quantify and structure people challenges and how to develop solutions to fit the facts. She’s also the definition of “cool, calm, collected”, with an understated style of handling the biggest curveballs, always responding with a thoughtful, engaging ease. She’s a sought-after coach and mentor, both at our clients and internally at Gray Scalable.
Her favorite projects:
“One of my first, Betterment, I developed a manager training series that we completed over about 6 months so I was really able to see the positive impact on the managers in the organization.
[Also] Bark & Co., I helped an HR-less org make some incredible progress, I helped to make a key talent hire, implemented a career development roadmap and trained their managers on what it means to be a successful manager at Bark (the puppies didn't hurt either).
At Intersection, I helped to build out their awesome People team, with a few integral hires, it was so nice to see the impact of those hires and help set them up to do some really amazing work.”
What else is new?
Aja had her second daughter a few months ago - we love seeing their adventures on Instagram. She and her family also just made the move to the NJ suburbs. Aja recently returned from maternity leave with lots of ideas for new workshops, new clients, and building up our HR services team."

Michael’s role at Gray Scalable:
As a Sourcing Consultant, Michael specializes in researching startups and the talent market and connecting candidates with roles for our clients. He also works on implementing our CMS/ATS system and is always exploring new sourcing tools and methods.
Michael’s proudest moment at Gray Scalable was making his first successful candidate-client connection at Wellpass! When he started with Wellpass, it was very early stage, so when he reached out, that was the first time the engineer had heard about the company. “It was incredibly satisfying to be able to connect her with a new opportunity that she might not have found on her own - especially one with a mission that she believed in and a product she was excited to help build.”
His favorite projects:
“I've been lucky enough to be at a large client (Buzzfeed) and a tiny one (Wellpass) and I've liked each for different reasons. It's fun to recruit for something that people have already heard of and know about (like Buzzfeed), but it can also be fun to educate people about something new and innovative (Wellpass). I've also really enjoyed getting to work on streamlining our workflows and integrations with our ATS/CRM.”

This post, by Kathleen de Lara, originally appeared on the Entelo Blog. Kathleen is the Inbound Marketing Manager at Entelo, in this blog post she shares the dos and don'ts of hiring a growing team based on company culture:
Beware of hiring people cut from the same cloth as your team – it could work against what you’re striving to build.
To start, let’s define company culture – an organization’s “genetic code”, an understanding of the overall vision, mission, and values demonstrated by employees’ actions and attitudes. Finding people who embody your company’s standards and principles can be a challenge, but lock in a few, key individuals, and it may seem like you have the blueprint to building a model team. That’s exactly the problem.
Organizations are often prone to finding and hiring people they like – employees who work hard, collaborate well with others, contribute to the company, and ultimately, jibe with the culture in place.
While this can almost guarantee you’re hiring someone who will do and fare well with the team, consider who you’re missing out on by dismissing people who aren’t exactly “perfect,” or fit the mold of who you already have on your team. Hiring for culture fit is frequently misunderstood as hiring people with similar attitudes, traits, beliefs, and experiences as those on the team. That can mean identifying candidates who graduated from top universities, previously worked at a highly regarded orgs, or who are experts and purple squirrels of their domain.
As Jon Bischke explains on HR Happy Hour, for some companies, culture fit becomes a matter of bucketing candidates under these checkboxes: Does this person look like us? Talk like us? Walk like us? Thinking of culture fit this way encourages bias, exclusiveness, and the likeliness for companies to multiply the status quo.
Instead, hire people who are a “culture add” – that means people who not only support the team’s values and professional ethics, but also bring an aspect of diversity to the team. Alternative viewpoints, unconventional experiences, rare, specialized skill sets. Hiring people who add to your culture also champions a more inclusive means for evaluating candidates, rather than focusing on what a candidate doesn’t have. Instead, think: What can this person could bring to the table?
When employees experience the benefits of a diverse team, they’re more naturally inclined to seek diverse candidates to support a continually developing team. More, newer ideas are discussed, different communication styles thrive, and candidates from diverse backgrounds become engaged with what your company has to offer."
47,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2017/7/26/gray-scalables-2nd-annual-start-up-recruiter-survey,"A REFERENCE GUIDE FOR BUILDING YOUR HR FUNCTION
Last year, we launched our start-up recruiter survey, geared at learning how recruiters meet the hiring demands of growing companies. This year, we once again asked questions about the makeup of the recruiting team as well as how the hiring process was structured. We also added a new section on HR practices - asking about surveys, performance, HR tools, and compensation.
Recruiters from over 40 start-ups participated in the survey. These companies ranged in size from under 50 to over 500 employees and came from cities across the US (though the majority - about 75% - are based in New York).
We turned the results into a guide to help start-ups build out their people practices. Here’s what we learned:
Building a Recruiting Team
Hiring the first recruiter - how much experience do start-up recruiters typically have? As with last year’s findings, recruiters at start-ups are generally not new to the field; 65% had more than six years of recruiting experience, and 27% had 10 or more. Only 10% had fewer than 2 years of recruiting experience. Making sure you hire a recruiter with a solid amount of experience is a sound idea - it’s not an easy job!
When start-ups add the second recruiter. Most start-ups add a second or third recruiter after 50 employees, and all companies over 200 employees had at least 2-3 recruiters. Those with more than 500 employees had at least 4-5 (with 60% reporting 6 or more recruiters).
When to add recruiting coordinator support. At under 50 employees, most recruiters reported doing all the scheduling themselves. From 51-100 employees, some teams had recruiting coordinators but many were still getting help from an administrative employee in the company (but not a designated recruiting coordinator), which suggests that companies may need this role sooner than they think. At the 100 employee mark, half reported having a designated recruiting coordinator and after 150 employees, it was unusual for a company to not have this support role. At the 300 employee mark, there were at least 2-3 coordinators, if not 4 or more. This suggests that if you’re growing quickly, you may want to open that recruiting coordinator job before you get to 100 employees (and if you’re growing very quickly, even sooner!).
Recruiting Team Expectations
How many roles should a recruiter handle at one time? From the graph below, the majority of recruiters reported being responsible for 6-10 roles or 11-20 at any given time. Having more than 20 open jobs at one time was unusual (less than 10% of recruiters).
This information can also help guide the ‘when to add a second recruiter’ question from above - if you’re a growing company that anticipates that there will be 20+ roles open at your company at any given time, it may be the right time to add a second recruiter.
In addition, the types of roles being recruited for matter as well. Those reporting that they were primarily responsible for engineering and product roles reported being responsible for fewer requisitions than those recruiting for other roles. Nearly 70% of tech recruiters were responsible for 10 or fewer roles, and 25% reported working on fewer than 5 at any given time. Interestingly, 100% of the tech recruiters responsible for more than 10 roles at at time reported having recruiting coordinator support, suggesting that you can offset a slightly higher workload if there is a support role in place.
How long does it take to fill a role? Recruiters in our survey reported taking mostly between 1-2 months to fill a role. This fits with what we’ve seen at our clients and other places we’ve worked, where the average time to fill is usually somewhere around 50 days (from the time a job opens until the offer is accepted).
How many hires are made per month? Recruiters generally reported making 5 or fewer hires per month (80%). As with the number of open roles, the type of job matters as well - 80% of tech recruiters reported 3 or fewer hires per month, while 90% of those recruiting for non-tech roles made 4 or more.
Hiring Process
How many interviews before a candidate gets an offer? Thankfully, 97% of recruiters responded that fewer than 10 people interview a candidate before they get to offer stage (that includes the recruiter interview). That said, it looks like there tends to be ‘interviewer creep’ as a company grows; the larger the company, the more likely recruiters were to report a higher number of interviews before getting to an offer.
While we understand that there may be situations where it makes sense to have more people weigh in on a candidate, putting a ceiling on the number of interviews a candidate has to go through will keep your process efficient and ensure your candidate has a positive experience.
Is structured interviewing a standard practice? ‘Structured interviewing’ refers to whether a company uses consistent questions and topics across interviews (compared to letting an interviewer ‘wing it’ or ask questions like what type of tree they are). In our survey, 83% of start-up recruiters reported that they used structured interviews. This is even higher than last year, where 71% of recruiters reported the same. Overall, structured interviewing helps find the best fits for your open jobs and reduces bias in your hiring process.
What about skills tests? Having a candidate complete a skills test during the interview process (before or during in-person interviews) has also become a common practice among start-ups - only 12% of recruiters reported not using any sort of skills test during the interview process. However, the majority of skills tests are engineering based, with very few companies reporting that it is a practice across all job functions -
Do interviewers score candidates? Interview scoring is also regularly used at start-ups. Only 12% of recruiters responded that there is no formal interview scoring (these were not the same 12% from skills-test group). The majority (59%) reported that they use a simple 2-point scale (a simple ‘thumbs up’ or ‘thumbs down’), while 30% reported using either a 4-point or 5-point scale.
What applicant tracking system do start-ups use? As with last year’s results, Greenhouse takes the cake as the ATS most used by the recruiters in our survey.
What are the most common sources of hire for start-ups? When it comes to where recruiters get their hires, the most common sources are employee referrals, direct reach outs, and inbound applicants.
Employee referrals were the most popular source of hire last year as well. If you would like some tips on referral programs, we’ve got you covered - check out our post from earlier this year.
What are the go-to sourcing platforms for recruiting candidates? LinkedIn was far and away the most common recruitment tool, with 85% of recruiters putting it in their top 3. Below is a graph showing the platforms that were used by at least 10% of recruiters -
Building diversity into your recruiting practice. With the emphasis on the importance of employee diversity in the news this year (in addition to being important in general), we were hoping to see an increase in the number of start-ups reporting that they built diversity practices into their hiring process. However, this graph remains relatively unchanged from last year -
If you’re interested in some steps you can take, here’s a pretty comprehensive guide to get you started, provided by the VC firm Homebrew.
Building out your HR Practice
When do I move from a PEO to HRIS? In our survey, the switch to standalone HRIS solutions picks up around 100 employees, and no companies reported using a PEO after about 200 employees. The HRIS’ systems used by start-ups varied widely, but the most common ones in the survey were Namely, ADP, BambooHR and Workday (the latter was only reported for companies over 500 employees).
Conducting employee surveys. Employee engagement surveys were relatively popular among start-ups - 78% of recruiters reported that their companies used them. The usage of them did not depend on company size, which suggests that engagement surveys are a decision made by leadership to learn about their organization rather than a function of growth. The most popular tools among our respondents were SurveyMonkey, CultureAmp, and Google Forms.
Do start-ups use market compensation data? Most start-ups in our survey reported using external market data to benchmark their salaries - 68% reported using a compensation consultant and/or market survey data, and only 15% reported that they did not use any at all. The remainder were unsure whether external market data or consultants had been used.
How often is employee performance reviewed? Start-ups in our survey reported that employee performance was formally evaluated most commonly on an annual or bi-annual basis. Only 12% of companies reported not having any formal performance review.
What about performance scores? The debate of “should we have performance ratings?” continues. Half of respondents reported that they used performance scores (with five- and four- point scales as the most popular), while the other half reported that they did not use scoring at all.
Thank you to all the recruiters who took our survey this year!

48,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2017/7/5/backdoor-references-resist-the-temptation,"The first thing I do when I’m reviewing a potential candidate for a job I’m recruiting for is check who I might have in common with that person on LinkedIn. It’s a really valuable exercise - especially if I see the candidate is connected to the hiring manager for the open role, for example. I might even reach out to that hiring manager to get an opinion prior to putting that person into the interview process.
But that’s where we can get into some murky waters. About half the time, I’ll get a response along the lines of…
I don’t really know the person, but my friend worked with her - let me ask!
or
I know his boss at his previous company - I bet she’ll give me the inside scoop.
We’d never reach out to a candidate’s direct boss before getting their permission to do a formal reference check - and hiring managers wouldn’t either. So, why has it become an almost-standard practice for folks who are not recruiters to do what’s commonly known as backdoor references - sometimes even before a candidate walks in the door?
It’s not that anyone is trying to do harm - it’s a sincerely well-intentioned move: to try to up the quality of candidates walking in the door, and to save interviewers’ time. That said - I do think it’s important to resist the temptation. Here’s why:
Candidates have an expectation of confidentiality
Anyone who applies or is a sourced prospect has an expectation that their candidacy will be held in strict confidence. Even if you are asking someone who worked with the candidate at a past-not-current job, and even if that person is someone you trust implicitly - you’re still breaking that trust. It’s not a great place to start the relationship. Remember that there’s a decent chance the backdoor reference will (confidentially!) let the candidate know you reached out for that reference. Remember, too, that if the shoe were on the other foot, you’d want to be able to control who became aware that you were thinking about making a change.
You’re poisoning/sweetening the well
If you’ve structured your interviews well, it’s important to trust in your evaluation process versus trying to circumvent it. Give the candidate the opportunity to prove him/herself, versus relying on an informal opinion that may or may not represent the candidate’s abilities.
You’ll have the chance to talk to those backdoor references
I know, I just said you couldn’t :). But there’s a way to get the information you want from the people you want to talk to, without breaking confidence with the candidate. Allow your candidate to go through the full process. If things go well enough for you to get to the reference checking phase (we always recommend checking references), partner with your recruiter to see who the candidate serves up. If s/he doesn’t offer up the person you’re connected with - simply ask the candidate his/her thoughts about you reaching out to that person for an opinion. You’ll learn a lot simply by asking: either the candidate will say, “Sure! I didn’t even think of that!” or will give you a reason why that person might not be the best reference. You’ll also cultivate the candidate’s trust by asking permission versus just reaching out.
In lieu of a backdoor reference, I’m suggesting a robust and well-timed reference checking process that takes place after a well-constructed interview process - that ideally includes those backdoor references done with the candidate’s permission. It’s hard to resist the temptation, but hopefully, knowing you can still learn what you want to learn can help you wait just a little bit.

The best part is... you don’t actually have to combine the teams to reap the benefits we’ve experienced. Here are three ways you can leverage the expertise of each team to build a stronger organization:
1. Include your business partners (BPs) in the kick-off process for new roles
Context: At Greenhouse, our recruiters do a lot of discovery when they kick off a new role. That discovery turns into our interview plans, which are an incredibly rich resource and answer questions like:
What’s the business need for this hire at this time?
What are the high-level objectives and 90-day goals for this person?
What are the qualities, technical capabilities, and interpersonal skills we’ll need this person to have?
While our recruiters have always built interview kits and our Human Resources Business Partners (BPs) have always had access to them, it didn’t occur to us to intertwine their workflows until we combined the two teams and I started reviewing the interview plans.
What we used to do: Our approval process for opening a role included putting a second set of eyes on the interview plan before we officially open the role - for us it was historically someone at the director-level or above.
What we do now: That second set of eyes now belongs to the business partner (BP) who supports the team opening the role.
The benefit: This creates an opportunity for the business partner and recruiter to share important context on the role and overall profile of the team. Sharing knowledge in this way is a good check-and-balance that we’re building strong teams with balanced skill-sets. That makes for more effective teams and a more effective Greenhouse.
TACTICAL TIP: If you’re using Greenhouse as your recruiting tool, you can create a notification that alerts the BPs of internal applications. This gives the business partner a heads up on potential internal moves – information that might otherwise take a couple days or weeks to filter over to your Talent Management team.
2. Notify BP’s about new hires as soon as an offer is accepted
Context: When a new hire joins Greenhouse, they get access to Greenhouse Onboarding (our product) and go through our company-level Onboarding Program. Behind the scenes, the new hire’s manager is also working with her business partner to run through her own onboarding checklist and make sure the new hire gets onboarded to both the team and manager but also Greenhouse overall.
What we used to do: BPs heard about new hires as part of onboarding setup, typically about halfway between offer acceptance and start date.
What we do now: BPs are automatically notified as soon as an offer is accepted.
The benefit: This gives the BP a leg up on supporting managers as they prepare to onboard their new person. Data shows that good onboarding leads to better outcomes. When our managers are prepared to onboard new hires, it means new hires ramp faster, are more effective sooner, and stay longer. Everybody wins.
TACTICAL TIP: If you’re using Greenhouse Recruiting and Greenhouse Onboarding, there are actually two ways you can do this:
In Greenhouse Recruiting, you can notify your business partners when you mark a candidate as “hired”, or
In Greenhouse Onboarding, you can set up your tasks to notify the business partner when a new hire has been added to the system (i.e., when a new hire is pushed over from an accepted offer in Greenhouse Recruiting).
3. Capacity-planning and Org changes
Context: BPs are usually the first people to know about organizational changes - from promotions to departures and everything in between. While it might not always be appropriate to share this information with your entire recruiting team, it’s vital information for effective planning on your talent acquisition team.
What we used to do: At Greenhouse, this communication loop has always been pretty close, but we use to shared this kind of information in a more ad-hoc manner, which meant there was occasionally a lag in sharing key moves.
What we do now: Our BPs and the head of Talent Acquisition now have regular touch-points throughout the week to share information around promotions, transfers, departures and other organizational changes.
The benefit: If your organization is growing, business needs change FAST. Knowing when and how org changes are happening allows us to better plan and adjust our recruiting capacity to business demand. This means we can open roles more quickly, which means hiring managers get help faster, and Greenhouse can meet its business objectives sooner.
TACTICAL TIP: Depending on the rate of change in your org and/or how fast you’re growing, consider having these touch-points at least once a week.
Summing it up
In this post, I’ve shared some of the ways we’ve found our talent teams work more effectively when they’re intertwined. Six months in, we’re still uncovering really interesting ways that Talent Acquisition and Talent Management work better when they work together. I hope you’ve found this post helpful and would love to hear how Talent Acquisition and Talent Management work together in your org!"
52,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2017/8/30/7-steps-to-a-improve-the-top-of-your-resume,"Are “Professional Objectives” and LinkedIn summaries still a thing these days? Do people read them or just pass over them to read the work history or connections? As recruiters, we generally appreciate them, because when well written, they help us get a clear idea of who the candidate is, and what he/she is looking for. But, ""well written"" is the key here - check out our advice:
Know your audience.
Who are you hoping reads this and what do you want them to learn? What do you want them to immediately know about you?
Outline your content.
Before you even start writing, take a moment to brainstorm. What are the most important experience and skills you want to share? Keep in mind that the first two sentences are the most important because that’s what everyone sees. On LinkedIn, they’ll have to click to read more based on what your first two sentences say.
Grammar and professionalism matter.
Decide to write in either first or third person, don’t switch back and forth. First-person allows you to start a connection with the reader and it allows them to get to know you.
Add multimedia elements (i.e hyperlinks).
This allows you to share the maximum amount of material and information about yourself, your skills and your experience.
Be authentic.
Especially if you’re talking about specifically why you do what you do.
Demonstrate your skills and specialities.
You can do this by sharing your experiences and giving specific examples of how X led you to Y.
End with a call to action.
For example, on LinkedIn you may want to encourage the reader to connect with you or to send a message, if they share a common interest or can offer you something of value to your career."

What’s new at Gray Scalable?
Erin started her career in sales and marketing, spent a couple of years at Google and Youtube, and has worked independently as an e-commerce, marketing and merchandising consultant. Most recently she spent a few years building an east coast executive search practice specializing in senior technologists.
Does that mean that Gray Scalable is now doing Executive Search?
Yes! Although we have done several targeted executive searches for People VPs, CTOs and CROs for some of our long term clients, we will now be managing searches for new clients, with Erin leading the way. She will also be responsible for developing new business for all of our recruiting services, including embedded search and consulting.
We also recently welcomed Emily Werthamer to the team. Emily will also be managing executive searches independently. In addition to several years working in third-party executive search, Emily managed the exec recruiting function at both Patch and Aol.
In other exciting news, Darla Hornbjork, our veteran tech recruiter and sourcing team manager, has had a baby, dropped a hyphen, and packed up and moved to LA!
Wait... Does that mean that Gray Scalable is now open for business in Southern California?
Yes it does! We are excited to meet new clients and start building new relationships in California, and Darla will be back from her maternity leave in early October.
There are lots of other exciting team members, including our newest recruiter Ben Schumer, our newest sourcer Angelica Martinez and our versatile new social media boss Irene Courey.
We’re looking forward to continued growth over the next year as we bring on some really interesting new clients, expand our geographic range and offer new services. Thanks for following us!"
54,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2017/9/21/first-principle-of-compensation,"First Principle of Compensation
At Gray Scalable, we help a lot of companies set up a rational compensation structure and set their pay to market. It’s a foundational product to us, because this can then help companies with so many other things - like career development, hiring the best talent, etc.
But one of the biggest benefits is communications - that is, it enables the company to talk to its employees confidently and knowledgeably about their pay. As a great HBS study demonstrated, the communication about pay can matter more than the actual pay itself.
Our first principle about compensation is that while you should never be totally transparent with your employees about everyone’s pay, you should act as if you are (except in the simplest of workplace populations or union environments, where it may actually be possible or necessary to have very strict and uniform comp structure). Every compensation decision you make, from new hire offers to annual increases to bonus payments - should be a decision you could reasonably defend if suddenly the curtain were pulled back and the whole team knew about that decision.
This enables you to be proactive about comp decisions and conversations, and it challenges you to ensure you’re treating everyone fairly. It’s also a good defense against all the potential pitfalls of NOT having a defensible process - like employees asking each other about pay and drawing their own conclusions, or having to respond regularly to counter-offers.
This is a key ingredient of organizational health, and it requires a rational compensation structure as a starting point.

Jobseekers often go about their search with a general idea of what they’re looking for in their next role -- whether that’s an increase in pay, change in industry, or even location. But there’s another important question they should ask themselves before anything else: what kind of workplace fits me best? Even more specifically, corporate world, or startup?
Maybe you’ve been in the startup scene for a while and are wondering what the corporate world has to offer; maybe you’ve read one too many articles about the crazy “perks” of working at a startup (free snacks, anyone?) and are wondering if it really lives up to the hype. Or, maybe you’re still unsure about what the differences between these two concepts even are.
Throughout my career so far, I’ve been lucky enough to see the best of both worlds, and though I may be a little biased (after all, I left the corporate world for a chance to embed myself within some of NYC’s best startups as a sourcer), I’ve been able to get a pretty clear picture of the pros and cons of both. What’s good for me may not be good for you, so here are a few things to keep in mind when deciding between the corporate and startup environments.
The Culture
Depending on the size of the startup, it’s likely you’ll be able to get to know most people that you work with pretty well. The professional can often blur into the personal, because you’ll probably be a part of a really tight-knit, highly collaborative team, working long hours and essentially helping to build a company. For this reason, most startups are very selective about who they bring on--they need to make sure everyone is a cultural fit as they grow and evolve as a team.
By contrast, in the corporate world, it’s entirely possible to go years without knowing every single person who works there--whether that’s because they work on a different floor, or your department’s functions don’t necessarily intersect with theirs. You become much more accustomed to working only within your own department, and there may be less room for cross-functional collaboration. That being said, big corporations may often have the resources to throw large, company-wide events to make it easier to network internally.
In startup cultures, there's also usually a difference in the way people approach their work. You have a bit more autonomy in how you’re going to meet goals and complete projects. In fact, you’re often encouraged to be creative and present new ideas on how to make a process more efficient or to produce better results. You can work at your own pace, as opposed to the rigidity of a corporate environment, where things may be a bit more bureaucratic when trying to enact change.
Most startups nowadays are also fairly flexible about dress codes, vacation time, and can offer interesting perks like flex hours or the ability to work from home -- but don’t mistake a casual culture for a lazy one -- you may actually have more responsibilities because you’re required to wear many hats. That means you should be highly amenable to change, re-prioritize at a moment’s notice, and adapt quickly. And because you have more autonomy, you’ll have to be good at setting your own deadlines and managing yourself -- which definitely isn’t easy for everyone.
Career Growth Path
There’s a reason they call it the corporate ladder. In most corporate industries, there is usually a clear-cut way to get to roles of progressive seniority. You can actually see a definitive path to becoming VP/Director, because others have done it before you. There’s a sense of safety in knowing that if you put in the time, you’ll reach your ultimate goal. Plenty of people value the certainty and stability that comes with that.
In the startup world, however, since roles and career ladders are not as clearly defined, there’s a mentality that everyone pitches in, and there’s no such thing as “not my job”. While this means you can gain experience in a wide variety of roles, and can think about your career on a broader level, it could also add some uncertainty about career path, timing for promotions, pay increases, etc. For someone making the switch from a large organization to a startup this can be the biggest culture change of all.
Recognition and Transparency
Since I began working at a startup, I’ve really gotten a sense that my success is the company’s success. It’s great to feel the satisfaction of knowing that your impact is visible and valuable. On the same note, if you are unhappy about a decision that was made by leadership, you are encouraged to voice your opinion in a productive way, and offer ideas on how to make it better.
In the corporate world, while your success may be recognized by your immediate supervisor and may even help to move you up the org chart, you may be unaware of how your work is impacting the company as a whole. In fact, you may not even have a say in the decisions that are affecting you on a daily basis and there’s a tendency to feel like another cog in a wheel. For some, that’s motivation enough to aspire to leadership positions.
All in all, this decision really depends on the kind of person you are, and the kinds of skills you want to develop. Some may value the structure and resources of a corporate job, while others thrive in a more collaborative or casual space. I should also make the disclaimer that there are always exceptions to the rules, and it’s entirely possible for aspects of each environment to intersect. But generally, you should keep these points in mind if you’re looking to make a career change in the future.

56,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2018/1/9/gray-scalable-employee-spotlight-drew-koloski,"A little more information about Drew, or Drewski, our Head of Technical Recruiting...
Drew’s role at Gray Scalable:
Drew joined Gray Scalable in July of this year as the Head of Technical Recruiting. He oversees all embedded tech recruiting engagements and works hard to ensure that his team has everything they need to properly do great work for our clients.
In addition to managing his team, Drew looks across all of our Gray Scalable clients to find solutions to common problems and trends, to ensure they’re gaining access to what’s working in the insanely competitive race for hiring developers. Drew is excited to have earned Charlie’s trust in taking on responsibilities in scaling such an important part of the business.
“I look forward to the challenge and responsibility of managing a strong, smart, independent and eclectic group of recruiters, everyone has a very different style, experience and they come from different backgrounds. Our range of in-house talent helps us attack a variety of tough tech recruiting challenges constantly popping up across a diverse group of clients.”
How he got into HR:
After his first job in technology sales and some experience in a recruiting agency, Drew was eventually hired by a client on the corporate side. He spent time working and progressing through different companies and startups, and was lucky enough to build a career in the tech community as the tech scene in NYC really flourished.
Prior to joining the GS team, Drew spent 2+ years building his own recruiting-tech start up. After some time, Drew decided to move back to the human side of the HR business, “Being a founder was an amazing experience, when it was time to find my next challenge Gray Scalable was an obvious fit. Gray Scalable has the best business model in the recruiting business, period. We service clients as true partners in a way that creates lasting value that they appreciate. It’s not just about making hires, it’s about building a progressive, data-first culture of tech recruiting that lasts long beyond the engagement.
Our model allows our consultants to make an impact across the full recruiting life cycle of a client’s company. Tech recruiting consultants are viewed as experts, which empowers them to cut through the typical hiring gridlock that you might find as an internal recruiter. They care about technology and approaching the community, and developers the right way. We are patient, and listen to candidate’s goals to match them to the right the job, instead of trying to match a job to a bunch of key words on a resume. We sit on site at clients, work with them throughout the entire process, and it makes the tech recruiting consultant job a fulfilling experience.”
Drew’s favorite part of working at Gray Scalable:
“The dedication and capability of our employees here that are earlier in their career - everyone is supporting the recruiting team, everyone is willing to take on more responsibility, which has allowed us to take on more as a company as we grow to find new clients. While we have an amazing group of folks on the tech recruiting team, we have a really strong team as a whole at GS. This is a very challenging place to work, you would think that we have a really experienced team, but it’s a great place to start early and then to grow and develop faster than your peer group, especially in the role that you have, and in the career that you want to build.”
What he’s most excited about:
Drew is the most excited to continue to build the tech recruiting team at Gray Scalable. Naturally, he is enjoying the challenge of finding the absolute best tech recruiters in New York and LA, “because of the quality of our work and reputation that we’ve built at Gray Scalable, our clients present some very challenging projects that require an individual who is extremely passionate about technology and recruiting as a craft, someone who wants to work independently, and really push themselves to be an expert tech recruiter. They’re trusted with a lot of responsibility, leadership and have the latitude to help our clients make critical hiring decisions on their own.”
Some fun facts about Drew:
Drew has three amazing kids, and lives on the Jersey shore, just five minutes from beach. He is obsessed with soccer and plays about three times a week. He is proud of his experience building companies from the ground up, including his startup Upsider, and was the first ever employee at American Express’s first joint-venture, Vente-Privee USA. One of his weirdest and fun job experiences was working at Cheers in Boston during college..."

A little more about Brett Moskowitz, Gray Scalable’s Head of Client Partnerships and Growth…
Brett’s role at Gray Scalable
As the Head of Client Partnerships and Growth, Brett is primarily responsible for pursuing strategic opportunities and cultivating partnerships. He seeks out interesting growth stage tech companies who are looking to scale and need help developing their people operations.
When asked what he specifically looks for in clients, Brett said, “I’m looking for clients that we can truly partner with. In the initial stages, I work to understand their needs and how our team can help with the challenges that they’re currently facing as well as anticipate future needs. At Gray Scalable, one of the ways we differentiate ourselves is that we’re not just a transactional agency - our collaborative approach helps us solve client’s current needs as well as helping to build the best system & processes for the long term as well.”
How he got into the HR/Tech Startup world:
Brett graduated from the University of Arizona with a BA in psychology. He considered pursuing psychology as a career, but soon found himself in the early days of the tech scene at Yahoo. He was really attracted to the young, fast growing company and how they were changing the way people communicate.
He went on to spend seven years working within various sales roles at other seminal Web 1.0 companies, Microsoft and AOL, that helped form the foundation of a valued network of friends and future business leaders. Brett was excited to leverage that experience in the startup world and go somewhere where he could have a greater voice and impact. He proceeded to work at various AdTech startups in New York leading sales teams and helping to build culture.
Brett met Charlie and Deb in 2012, during the very first Gray Scalable client engagement where they helped scale the Dstillery sales team while simultaneously iterating and developing the business model for embedded recruiting:
“My experience working with Charlie & Deb was instrumental in my success as a sales leader. They helped to educate me on what a smart, successful recruiting process is, taking the time to understand the values and culture of the org and how to represent them in market. They helped me hire a stellar team and even when they were no longer engaged with us, the team and our hiring managers continued to benefit from having worked with them. Being able to speak first hand to the value they, and Gray Scalable’s model, can bring to a client is a great asset in my current role.”
Brett’s favorite part of being at Gray Scalable:
“I enjoy working with such a talented and passionate group of people, who all share the same values of putting our clients first and taking pride in our ability to help impact a company’s growth. It’s also incredibly exciting to get exposure to such a diverse group of industries, companies, and leaders that are shaping our world.”
Brett looks forward to growing and scaling the Gray Scalable org the same way we do for our clients.
Some fun facts about Brett:
Brett was born in Brooklyn, raised in Connecticut, and after long stints in SF and Manhattan, found his way back to BK. He’s passionate about travel and seeing as much of the world as possible. Brett’s last major trip was an eight month sabbatical through India and Nepal highlighted by an Everest Base Camp trip and a ten day silent meditation retreat. He loves Leonard Cohen and is trying to learn to play guitar (again).

It’s beginning to look a lot like downtime…
In today’s tech world, it’s so often that employees struggle letting go, winding down, checking out and truly taking a break over the holidays - over any vacation for that matter. It’s important to take some time, to really unplug and enjoy the time off for you, for your loved ones and also for your company. Check out these tricks from some of the Gray Scalable team to help you unplug, unwind and come back to work recharged after the holidays:
Create strict time windows to check in -
“On my time off, the weekends, on holidays, I sign off. I don’t look at email, I use the time to unplug and separate, and I am really conscious about blocking off my time to take the break, recharge and reset.
I found that this helps me, versus constantly staying “on” all the time. If I really take the time to step away and clear my mind, I’m able to go back to work with a new, refreshed and different perspective on various tasks. It forces me to step back and stop going down the same path over and over again. It’s more valuable to really walk away, and give yourself the break. Take time for yourself and your family, separate from work and actively remind yourself to chill out.”
- Katie Moriarty, Recruiting Consultant
Prepare ahead of time to stay organized -
“Make a list of what you need to do to feel like you can actually unplug. You already know your day to day, so try figuring out what you can do ahead of time to clear your schedule for a week or a few days. Apart from your weekly to-do list, make a few item list of actual deliverables to know that you work is taken care during the time you’re taking off. Being preemptive about it - whether that means making sure you have someone to cover you, or a certain task or two is done ahead of time, it’s helpful to know that you can actually take the time without falling behind.
Set aside one or two days before getting back to work, to look at what’s ahead and get your mindset organized. It’s nice to know what’s ahead, you’re getting your head ready for what’s coming when you get back into the office.”
- Angelica Martinez, Sourcing Consultant
Try something new -
“Try to do something over the holidays that’s the opposite of what you’re normally doing. Try a new class, or a craft or baking - something that will put you in a different mindset than when you’re at the office, working. It should be something that requires you to focus on something that’s not work related. This will recharge you by exercising a totally different part of your brain, and yourself than usual.”
- Lucia Smith, Human Resources Consultant
Take time to reflect -
“How I like to unwind over the holidays is similar to how I like to unwind at the end of the week. I like to take time to reflect on everything that’s happened to bring the week or the year to a nice close. I do this to feel at peace with what’s happened throughout the year.
Just last year, I started a new way to reflect on the previous year. I found that I never really stuck with goals, or new year’s resolutions, so I liked the idea of taking some time to think about a word as a nice way to start the year. Last year’s word was create. I wanted to rethink what’s possible in life, and I thought create would be a great reminder that you can create new concepts, practices and ideas.”
- Elise Sun, Sourcing Consultant
Take time for yourself over the holidays to relax and recharge, come back to work in the new year with more energy and new ideas for the new year!"
59,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2018/2/14/jump-start-your-companys-comp-strategy,"Jumpstart your Company's Comp Strategy
Startups of all stages and sizes have to create, manage and often adjust leveling and compensation structure within their companies. It’s important that every company develop a comp strategy - and although compensation is a topic central to every HR person’s role, it’s not one that every HR person has experience in.
Last week, we partnered with the team at Lifion by ADP to host a Roundtable Discussion on Employee Compensation Strategy. Led by Gray Scalable President, Charlie Gray, the roundtable turned into a large group conversation and open ended Q&A, with 20+ Start-up HR leaders from tech companies all over NYC.
If you weren’t among the HR professionals in attendance, we’ve summed up the key takeaways below. If you are interested in learning more about Gray Scalable and our future events, follow us on LinkedIn, Twitter or Facebook!
Discussing Employee Compensation
Think about your company’s current comp strategy... Typically, an initial compensation strategy that many companies have is “pay people what you need to pay them to accept the job, and pay them more when they ask for more” - and that often gets really messy as any company grows.
The most important factor to having any strategy is to get in front of it - be the initiator of the strategy.
As your company grows and ages what is the total rewards picture? Base pay comp is just one piece of this - when you’re hiring people, you’re offering many things besides just compensation. You’re offering benefits, equity, office perks - it’s important to understand what the whole picture is when you’re giving a candidate an offer. Most people will just assume that you want your pay to be strong and competitive. You don’t always have to be the top payer, but you need to decide where are you going to pay to be competitive in your field (in combination with everything else you include in your total rewards package). Comp is a very sensitive topic and lately we’re getting into a lot of conversations about transparency in compensation. If you’re in a company that competes for talent, and are just paying people whatever you need to pay them to accept the job- you probably can’t be fully transparent with all of your employees. But it’s important to figure out a way to have the conversation so people know that they’re being paid fairly. People generally think they’re underpaid, unless you educate them otherwise.
Q: How do you know if you’re paying fairly?
A: You as an HR person have to be able to tell your people that you’re paying fairly, and you have to be able to explain to them why. Some companies think being fair is being fully transparent, but that’s not true - figure out the fine line between being transparent and being fair.
Q: “What if you have been doing things that are not fair? An example, someone came to me and said, ‘I just found out that so and so got a bonus and I didn’t, what’s up?’ How do you fix that?”
A: If the management team is not with you on the principle of fairness, you’re not going to win. The management team needs to be on the same page when it comes to being fair. Correct things as you discover them, but create a annual or semi-annual cycle in which to review all compensation and test for fairness proactively. The anniversary thing is not sustainable past about 50 people. You’re making independent decisions without the grand scheme of things.
Leveling
The best way to align yourself with the market is to know that there are ten levels. If you’re a company of less than 1000 employees, maybe less than 500, the number is generally ten.
Once the hierarchy starts becoming a growing pain and people are wondering how the company is growing within their own career, you have to think about leveling and how you can show people where they can go within the company and how they can get there.
Q: “At what number do you decide on ten levels? With my company of 110, ten levels seems excessive.”
A: I would say 70-100 people is the right time to differentiate the ten levels.
Q: How do you fix title debt (ie people whose titles need to be re-leveled)?
A: It’s not easy and it takes a lot of time. Once you make a determination about where you want your company to be and what you want the title levels to be, set it there - people can grow into that structure. Although it is important to recognize that it is easier to level someone up then it is to level them down.
Q: “How do you get the right data?”
A: There is a ton of information out there, but you need to look at internal data first before you just look at market data. You have to look at leveling and structure within your company before you can compare yourself to the market. Employees in general will be wildly misinformed about data unless you inform them - they’re looking at this information, but it may not work for their stage within your company.
Paying for Performance
In theory, this works absolutely - but how are you going to do that if you don’t have performance reviews? And if you are using performance reviews, you have to have a way to quantify performance, like ratings.
Q: “Should the performance and comp conversations be separate? How do you tell people that there is a link/isn’t a link? We find that people fixate on the numbers when the conversations happen together.
A: I don’t think you need to separate the two things. Performance is going to affect how you pay people whether it’s clearly aligned or unclearly aligned."
60,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2018/2/28/todays-generation-is-changing-employee-benefit-packages-of-the-future,"I try not to use the “Millennial” label. It feels wrong to generalize about groups that include millions of people and I can’t help but detect some age discrimination, even if subtle or unintentional, in pronouncements about behavioral differences in various age groups. Evolution took hundreds of thousands of years; I don’t think we’ve drastically changed in the past two decades.
However, there are some realities of the early 21st century that have a substantial effect in how people entering the workforce think about things like financial stability, health and wellness, and professional development—things haven’t changed much in the last century, but now have become much more pronounced in the minds of young professionals. The shift in priorities of today’s workforce requires employers to change their approach to benefit offerings, and while some benefits are “evergreen”—such as good health care coverage—there are other creative ways to attract and connect with people facing today’s economic challenges.
To start, college tuition costs have gotten out of control. This impacts the way young professionals consider prospective employers. While a professional just out of college might seek out the maximum salary they can earn to compensate for that investment, smart employers are realizing that matching contributions to their school loans could be the selling point to someone comparing offers from multiple companies.
Not only is that employer offering them a real benefit that helps solve a current problem, they are taking the time to understand that person and relating to them in a way that the other companies most likely are not. The direct benefit might not even have the same dollar value as another company’s higher salary or retirement plan—but it’s never just about the numbers; it’s about winning someone over to your company because in some way it feels more like home.
Another thing that has shifted a lot over the last couple of generations are the loyalties between employees and employers, which have become weaker. Employers are shedding workers more frequently and as a result workers are becoming more comfortable with moving to a competitor for growth opportunities.
The companies that are fostering positive, long-term relationships with their people are doing it by creating career development programs that promise upward mobility for their employees, and provide the management expertise and HR programs to deliver on that promise. Is this because the young members of today’s workforce are hungrier to advance and more opportunistic than previous generations? I don’t think so. But it’s logical for them to embrace these programs as they make choices about their careers.
Another major change is that having a one-income family is becoming a thing of the past except among the very fortunate. As a result, parents of young children are seeking more flexibility from their employers, so they can effectively balance their multiple weekly commitments. Studies show that 35% of Millennials would take a pay cut in order to work remotely.
Employers who offer flexible scheduling, remote work opportunities and generous parental leave policies will not only attract more “Millennials,” but also create a more diverse workforce as a result, since these policies tend to weigh more heavily in women's career decisions than in men’s.
Here’s my advice to HR leaders that want to make their companies competitive and attractive to the best talent and want to be cutting-edge and appealing to young professionals: Carefully consider the day-to-day concerns your employees have and offer benefits that speak directly to those concerns. Your entire team will appreciate it, and you’ll continue to attract the best talent today’s workforce has to offer.

A little more about Darla, our first Los Angeles based Recruiting Consultant, leading Gray Scalable’s growth on the west coast...
Darla’s role at Gray Scalable:
Darla joined the Gray Scalable New York team in January of 2016, leading the growth of the sourcing team and managing recruiting engagements at NYC clients like Rocketrip and MM.Lafleur. As her family took on an intriguing, new adventure to Los Angeles, Darla used the opportunity to bring Gray Scalable’s services to the West Coast. The new location is the first outside of our Silicon Alley headquarters in NYC, and home to a growing team already in the greater LA area.
Darla began her career in HR as a Recruiting Researcher - as she recalls, “it was the first company out of college that offered me a job and rent in Brooklyn was due.” For the next decade and more, Darla has been working with tech companies to help them grow and scale. With expertise at hiring engineers, product designers, marketing and sales professionals, as well as partnering with C level suite to define talent strategy, she brings extensive experience building sourcing pipelines, developing process and internal tools, defining employer brand strategy and helping companies build their teams.
Proudest moment at Gray Scalable:
Darla fondly remembers many proud Gray Scalable moments, but two of them stand out:
“First, building the sourcing team from scratch and then handing it over to Bec, knowing that I took it as far as I could and she would do great things with the team. And also, hiring a CTO for MM.Lafleur. They were such a great client for us for so many reasons and I was happy to have introduced them to their first C-level tech leader.”
Darla’s favorite part of working at Gray Scalable:
“The support of our team! We are a hive mind that helps each of us solve any problem on behalf of our clients. And, since the company is entirely made up of HR or Recruiting professionals, there is a great deal of empathy for one another.”
What she’s most excited about:
As Gray Scalable’s first year on the west coast continues, Darla is looking the most forward to building the LA office! We’ve partnered with Native Instruments, the world’s leading manufacturer of software and hardware for music production and DJing - and we are working with them to help grow their the product and design team. With a strong commitment to agile development & culture, we are helping them expand their global community and we look forward to more exciting opportunities in California!

62,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2018/3/20/2018-year-of-the-employee,"2018: Year Of The Employee? Why companies are stepping up their HR game
With the tumultuous events of the past year in government as well as several leading industries, trust in leadership in general is trending downward. At the same time, the uncertainties and risks in the coming year create low business confidence and seem to be leading many companies to plan for cautious growth, if not targeted layoffs or retrenchment. These larger trends, in addition to the current generation’s comfort level with changing companies regularly, mean that investments in critical talent will likely need to increase in order for companies to retain their best employees.
Salaries have long been one of the largest line items in companies’ budgets, but many employees have not felt like they are treated with that same ranking of importance. The Year of the Employee means that a greater share of company attention and investment will shift to employee rewards of all kinds, and more focus on listening to employee needs, offering growth and development opportunities, and supporting employees as a whole person.
Investing in People Means Investing in HR
Those of us that work closely with the HR community, especially with startups, have noticed that HR is gaining influence at earlier stages, as Series A companies look for Heads of Talent and Series B companies look for Chief People Officers. Not only are they putting experienced people into these roles (v. promoting inexperienced people from within), they are giving them broader scope and a real “seat at the table” in many cases. The value of professional recruiting teams and people operations programs that focus on career development, leadership coaching and creative compensation are becoming more broadly understood by executives. It helps that the continuing advancement and awareness of “people science” or HR analytics is giving new credibility to People Leaders who embrace it, and helps leaders recognize that human resources isn’t just for welcoming new hires, planning company events, managing benefits and writing performance plans. When well executed, good HR practices have a dramatic effect on retention and general morale, and this makes HR’s benefits as quantifiable as any other function.
Advancements in Salaries and Benefits
Salary competitiveness, as well as the range of company benefits, are essential ingredients in a comprehensive retention strategy. It’s likely that more companies will be subject to unscientific internal self-surveys and public releases of unfiltered compensation data, as happened at Google this year. Alongside this, more cities and states will follow the lead of California and New York and pass laws focused on gender pay equity. Actions such as these, and the efforts of some companies to get ahead of these issues, will lead to more generous (and more fairly administered) compensation practices.
Time off policies are also evolving. Many companies are embracing “Open” vacation plans, and Paid Family Leave is replacing the traditional “Maternity Leave+” policy structures. Gender and role-blind parental leave is becoming more and more common with companies and will find its way into more legislation as well, as it has very recently in NYC. The distinction between primary and secondary caregivers is becoming less distinct as “secondary” parents gain recognition, which dramatically increases the number of people eligible for these benefits.
And in the modern workplace “soft” benefits are just as important as traditional ones (insurance coverage, vacation time.). To compete, progressive companies must make sure they have spaces for employees to relax/refresh, offer regular employee touch points with leadership (through company meetings, open town halls, suggestion boxes, etc.), and options to participate in employee resource groups or mentorship opportunities. All of these perks and programs will continue to grow and to gain acceptance (or expectance) in a broader range of industries. And of course there is the strategically critical area of career development – which requires long term structural planning, robust L&D programs, versatile Business Partners, and a sustained commitment from management to the mission of advancing employees in their careers. These are quantifiable commitments to employee health and loyalty, and will require continued investments in HR.
We expect all of these benefits to continue advancing in 2018. Whatever the underlying reasons are, policies and practices that put more emphasis on employee growth and rewards, that evolve workplace cultures are a welcome trend.

64,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2018/4/26/not-enough-experience-on-your-resume-rise-above-requirements,"You’re looking online for open jobs and your eyes light up -- you’ve found one that seems exciting! But then you scan the (so-called) requirements section and realize you don’t have every skill listed. Even though you believe you’d be good at the job, you feel you might not be qualified. I’ve written hundreds of job descriptions and reviewed thousands of resumes, and take it from me: While this can be a discouraging situation, you should absolutely still apply.
The elusive unicorn.
Given the choice, an employer would love to hire someone who has every single requirement listed, but job descriptions are written very broadly in order to cast a wide net. Employers are usually looking for a candidate who has some of the skills, not all of them.
In fact, it’s so rare to find candidates who fit every listed requirement that recruiters use the term unicorn to describe them. There are a number of ways to be qualified for a job, and checking every box on the “experience” list is just one of them -- there’s also your ability to communicate well or your proven experience picking up on things quickly, for example.
Still, if you don’t fit all the base requirements, it’s important to present yourself in your best light. There are a few key things you can do to help battle the perception that you’re not fully qualified for a role.
Create a unique resume for the job.
While you likely have a basic all-purpose resume, you should edit it for each job for which you apply. Highlight experience that directly links to what that particular company is looking for, and always list your most relevant experience at the top of your resume. Match your descriptions of what you’ve done in past roles with the job description, and it will catch any recruiter’s eye.
Don’t underestimate the power of a good cover letter.
This is your opportunity to tell a compelling story that fills in the gaps on your resume. Find friends whose writing skills you respect and ask them to help review and edit your cover letter and make sure you’re discussing everything you can bring to the company. Avoid talking solely about why you’re interested in working at a company, and focus instead on why it should be interested in you. Be confident and clear and lead with your strengths, no matter if they exactly match the job description.
Focus on personal projects.
If you are interested in a field but haven’t yet formally worked in it, it’s important to show that you’re passionate and have a basic understanding of the field. Blog posts, projects and online courses are a great way to fill in holes in your work experience and provide evidence of your skills that your work history may not be able to show.
Highlight your core skills.
Companies are always looking for employees who can grow and stretch with a role if it changes, and hiring managers generally look for some fundamental skills in addition to the requirements of a specific job. Examples include writing and communication skills, presentation skills, project planning experience and experience working in a fast-paced environment.
Google, for example, conducted an internal study that found that technical skill was the least important skill of their top employees -- above it was being a good coach and communicator, being open-minded and intuitive, being empathetic and being a critical thinker and problem solver.
More and more frequently, recruiters are being asked to assess these core skills; showing you possess them is of growing importance and can balance out other qualifications you may not meet. Employers know it’s a lot easier to teach someone how to use a tool than to teach them to be a problem solver.
A good general motto when it comes to applying for jobs is If you don’t enter, you can’t win. Never take yourself out of the running by not applying, and have confidence in yourself and your broader skill set. There are a lot of ways to be the “right” hire, and employers often don’t know exactly what they’re looking for until they find it. Play up your strengths, show you’re up to the task of learning quickly and always highlight what value you can bring to a company, no matter the job.

65,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2018/4/4/how-data-is-evolving-hr,"How Data is Evolving Human Resources
The field of People Science is transforming the way that HR is practiced in progressive companies, and changing the perception and expectations of HR along the way, by showing how the responsibilities of HR can be quantified, improved and most importantly, correlated with business results. Any competent Chief People Officer will have their own set of key metrics to monitor as well as preferred methods and platforms for integrating data into all aspects of their function. Here we’ll take a look at three examples—recruiting, compensation and company culture.
Recruiting. Strong recruiting leaders led the way with use of analytics to drive success, for a couple of reasons. First, the nature of recruiting is measurable in several obvious ways (from traditional measures like time-to-fill and cost-her-hire to more sophisticated data such as candidate pipeline progress, interview scores, and experience/performance correlations).
Second, business leaders will frequently recognize the value of a strong recruiting function, and fund it accordingly, earlier than they will put significant budgets on other strategic HR initiatives such as organizational planning or leadership development.
When it comes down to it, you can view recruiting as really a pure application of good data—if a company sets a goal of increasing certain hires by x amount, they can measure past performance, apply those metrics, and simply set the necessary resources against it almost by formula. The challenge is first just creating a system and process that collects this data reliably, but once you achieve that the rest should follow.
Compensation. This is the big game for HR professionals obsessed with data. The data itself is plentiful through comp surveys and data providers, and thoughtful experienced application of data can provide many also-quantifiable results for a company’s HR team, such as increasing retention and job satisfaction, rewarding performance, fairness of pay and commitment to diversity, hiring effectiveness, and more. The people scientists in most small-to-midsize organizations reside within the compensation team, but their expertise benefits the company and its employees in many ways beyond just compensation itself.
Culture. Most people will intuitively see this as the last quantifiable thing about a company—something important but also intangible, a set of qualities that can be surmised through a casual and unstructured conversation (often referred to as the “airport test” or “elevator test”). In fact, through tools like company surveys, manager assessments and exit interviews, coupled with basic psychology and a real commitment to authentic and values-driven culture, you can replace cultural bias with real facts, and develop a strong set of metrics that will drive your culture and your business results.
Smart use of data can impact every area of Human Resources, and enables HR leaders to represent themselves and their work in a quantifiable and results-focused way, just as marketing, operations, finance and other business executives do. A strong data analyst is one of the best hires a VPHR can add to their team, but it’s also important to hire HR professionals that understand and embrace using data to measure and advance their work—that’s how the strongest people leaders are now building their teams.

66,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2018/7/28/survey-2018,"Gray Scalable's 3rd annual start-up recruiter survey
Welcome to our third year of survey results! In our 2016 survey, we asked recruiters specifically about their talent acquisition practices. The following year, we added in a section to ask about HR operations like engagement surveys, compensation and performance reviews. This year, we added a few new questions to each section, combined the data points, and were able to take a first look at some interesting trends over time.
Our Survey Takers
Participants. 157 start-up recruiters over three years participated in our survey - a little over 50 each year have participated. The results below will be a combination of the three years unless otherwise noted. We recognize that there will likely be a few recruiters who have taken this more than once - but since start-ups grow quickly in size and scale their HR processes to match, what the company reports from one year to the next will likely reflect two very different companies, so we opted to report all the results together.
Locations. The majority of the start-ups were based in New York (68%), another 15% came from Northern California, 7% came from London, and the remaining 10% were spread out among other countries and US cities
Start-Up Size. The companies were evenly spread out among company size, with 20 or so responses from each category:
Building Recruiting Functions
Number of Recruiters. This year we looked at how many recruiters each start-up had as a function of company size. Check out the below animation -
When to add the second (or third, or more) recruiters will also depend on how quickly the company is growing and the types of roles you need to fill.
Recruiting Coordinators. We found that recruiting coordinator support grows as the number of recruiters does -
The graph on the left shows the number reporting one (or more) recruiting coordinators. The graph on the right is the same graph but it starts to show where multiple recruiting coordinators are added. Overall, once a second or third recruiter is added, it’s likely that recruiting coordinator support goes along with it. Once there are four or more recruiters, we start to see the emergence of multiple recruiting coordinators. It looks like the ratio is every two or three recruiters needs recruiting coordinator support.
Recruiters years of experience. As we’ve found in years past, start-up recruiters are not new to the job. It’s unlikely to see recruiters who have less than two years of experience, and 63% of recruiters have at least six years of experience in their role -
For companies where there was only one recruiter at the start-up, the number of recruiters with more than ten years of experience jumps to 40%, suggesting it’s best to have someone who knows the ropes start your recruiting operations.
Number of Jobs at One Time. Most recruiters reported being responsible for 6-10 roles at any given time (53%) or 11-20 (24%). It was rare to have more than 20 roles at a given time (6%) or fewer than 5 (18%).
Time to Fill. Both tech and non-tech recruiters reported taking 1-2 months to fill a role (48%) or 3-4 months (30%). The remaining 21% reported taking a month or less on average to fill a role. However, recruiters who were responsible for more than 10 roles at once were much more likely to report taking 2 or more months to fill a position than those who had fewer than ten roles.
Recruiting Operations
Diversity. Each year we’ve asked whether diversity is a company hiring goal, and asked recruiters to report whether there is anything formal in place to recruit a more diverse pool of candidates. In the first two years, there wasn’t much change, but this year we saw an uptick in the number of recruiters reporting that they have put formal measures in place to recruit more diverse talent. The number of recruiters reporting that diversity is not a stated goal has held steady at about 1 in 10 start-ups.
While we didn’t ask companies to tell us what measures they were taking to recruit more diverse talent, we know there are a lot of options out there - de-biasing job descriptions, unconscious bias training and participating in organizations that support diverse candidates are just a few ways we’ve seen companies take action.
ATS Usage. Similar to other years, Greenhouse was the most used ATS among start-ups (67% of responses). Jobvite, Lever and Workable reported 5% or more each. And this year we also saw the emergence of Hire by Google being used by start-ups, which launched last summer.
Structured Interviews. We asked recruiters to report whether they a structured interview process (consistent topics and questions across interviews). Year over year, about 80% report using structured interviews, which is great, as structured interviews combat bias and are better predictors of future job success compared to unstructured interviews.
Skills Tests. This year we noticed an increase in the number of start-ups requiring skills tests for all of their roles (compared to just for select roles like engineering) -
In addition to structured interviews, skills tests are also good predictors of job performance so the two in combination are hopefully yielding more successful hires for the companies that use reported using them in our survey.
Interview Training. Just over 60% of start-up recruiters reported that their companies had interview training provided for at least hiring managers (if not the whole company). This has remained consistent across three years -
Since structured interviews and skills tests are good predictors of on-the-job success, training your hiring teams to be methodical and consistent in the interview process is a great way to make sure everyone is on the same page.
Candidate Sourcing Tools. We ask recruiters to identify the three most used tools to source candidates -
Linkedin has remained the number one tool among all recruiters, and Entelo, AngelList and Hired.com seem equally used among tech and non-tech recruiters. Stack Overflow, Underdog.io and Github (the latter two not pictured in the graph above) were more common among tech recruiters.
Employee Referral Programs. A new question this year is whether companies have a formal employee referral program. The large majority (88%) reported that they did. We also learned many interesting things about how they are built -
Type of Award. The vast majority give out cash awards, but some companies reported other ways of rewarding employees, with some giving a donation to charity and others putting money toward employee travel.
How Amounts are Determined. It was most common for companies to give the same amount of cash for all referrals, but we also saw a quarter of companies report differentiating by role (mostly giving out higher awards for technical positions relative to operations) and a few companies reporting differentiating by level (mostly director and above having larger awards than more junior hires).
Referral Bonus Amounts. For those offering cash, the referral bonuses varied. The most common amounts were in the $1,000 - $3,000 range -
If a company paid more for tech (or higher level) roles, it was usually about double. For example, most companies paying $2,500 for a non-tech role reported paying $5,000 for a tech role.
HR Practices
Engagement Surveys. 78% of recruiters reported that their company has conducted employee engagement surveys. The size of the company doesn’t seem to matter - companies with fewer than 50 employees were just as likely to report using engagement surveys compared to larger start-ups. The most popular tools were Culture Amp (45% of those who conduct surveys), SurveyMonkey (26%) and Google Forms (19%).
Employee Performance Cycle. We asked participants how many times a year employee performance is reviewed. Over 80% of start-ups reported reviewing employee performance at least once a year (with the remaining 20% not reporting any review). Of those who do review employee performance, the most common timing was twice per year (53%), followed by annually (26%) and quarterly (21%).
Performance Ratings. Of the start-ups with a performance review process, 30% did not employ performance ratings. Of the 70% that did, a five point scale was the most popular (41%), followed by a four point scale (35%), and a three point scale (24%).
HRIS Tools. We asked participants to report what HRIS they used at their company. The most common (ones with 10% or more each) were the platform provided by their PEO, ADP, BambooHR and Namely.
HR Reporting Structure. A new question we asked this year is who the Recruiting function and HR function reports to at the company. Most commonly, recruiting reports up through HR, and HR reports up through the CEO.
Compensation Data. In 2017, 68% of start-ups in our survey reported using a compensation consultant or market survey data to inform their pay practices. The number is higher this year - 79% reported using market compensation data. The increase could partially be a result of the new law that went into effect in late 2017 in New York and California that prevents companies from asking candidates salary history during the interview process. Since most companies in our survey are no longer able to anchor an offer in what someone was previously making, having market data to turn to makes the offer process easier (and more fair!).

Gray Scalable has been conducting an annual recruiter survey for the past three years to provide startups with insights on building a powerful recruiting strategy. As a part of this survey we wanted to learn what recruiters felt were the biggest challenges and greatest rewards about the job. We’ve asked two optional, open-ended questions every year:
1. What is your biggest challenge as a recruiter?
2. What is the best thing about being a recruiter at a startup?
We grouped the responses into similar categories - below are our findings!
Challenges
Bandwidth
At startups, it’s common to see recruiters wearing multiple hats. A startup recruiter’s scope of responsibilities is rarely exclusive to recruiting-related job functions. At smaller startups (fewer than 100 employees), a single recruiter will often be responsible for all hiring needs and building the HR function. In our survey, 27% of responses reported this being one of their biggest challenges. Some recruiters summed it up in one word: burnout.
Startups are fast-paced almost by definition - which is often what makes joining them so attractive. But with that fast pace often comes unrealistic expectations of time to hire. As one responder put it, “keeping the bar high while moving at light speed”. Speeding-up the hiring process in a way that reduces the ability to appropriately assess candidate qualifications can negatively affect the entire company culture. Since recruiters know this all too well, it becomes a constant challenge to meet the daily demands while maintaining high standards.
Compensation
Another major challenge cited by recruiters - with 24% of responses falling into this category - was competition for top talent, particularly in tech roles. The market for specialists in technical fields is highly competitive and startups are vying for talent versus larger companies that have larger budgets and can afford to pay higher percentiles of pay.
Recruiters are searching for the best candidate, and compromising on qualifications or cultural fit is never a viable option. It’s a battle ground, it requires recruiters to spend longer hours searching for candidates, they’ll have to master a great sales pitch and brace themselves for the disheartening sound of rejection.
Brand Awareness
The third category - with 14% of responses - cited brand awareness as a challenge. When candidates don’t recognize the company, recruiters are the ones who must spend extra time going into the history of the company and getting the candidate excited about the product or service. This challenge presents itself at every stage of the recruitment process - beyond sourcing - and can impact things like offer acceptance rates. Recruiters have to pay attention to this problem, stretching their role outside of recruiting and into marketing, impacting their already-limited bandwidth.
Rewards
Impact
While recruiting for a startup has its challenges, it isn’t without its rewards. The most notable, with nearly 35% of responses,mentioned the impact they felt they had, by building the organization, and being an integral and direct part of the business growth. A few examples of responses are here:
“Watching the team grow, knowing you've been a huge part in the success”
“It's a fun and exciting journey and so awesome to be a part of ""building"" something.”
“I build things here, I have ownership, I contribute to the company growth…”
“…knowing that my ideas have led to operational excellence for HR and beyond is a great feeling.”
At a startup, top leaders are often accessible and eager to include employee ideas in decision-making. As a recruiter in a small organization, each hire recruiters make has an impact on the culture landscape, and ultimately impacts the success of the business. Startup recruiters get the satisfaction of visibly seeing the cultural landscape they’ve formed - and at the end of a long day, can be very proud of their accomplishments.
Pace
While the fast pace of a startup can be a challenge, nearly a third of of recruiters (28%) stated the best thing about working for a startup is the dynamic and fast-paced environment. Unlike a large corporation where ideas and improvements regularly get lost in a bureaucracy of red-tape, startups can pivot and shift strategies at lightning speed. This can be a huge motivational factor for people who embrace change and thrive off autonomy.
People and Culture
Being motivated by the people you work with and being a part of a highly collaborative and passionate group of people can have immense influence on how you feel about your job. Over 20% of our responses cited people and culture as being the best thing about working as a recruiter for a startup. A few quotes below:
“…working with passionate and motivated folks who like to get things done!”
“Awesome company culture & positive work environment…”
“Being around so many talented people.”
Perhaps it’s the long hours spent working on small, collaborative and dedicated teams, or maybe it’s the balance of fun perks and casual work environments. Whatever the case, startups have unique cultures that foster friendships among colleagues.
Conclusion
The survey responses reinforced some of the common assumptions when comparing work life at a startup versus at large corporations. Being a recruiter at a startup is challenging: you face problems that you wouldn’t otherwise face at a large company, and are always pressed for more time. But many people who work at startups and experience those challenges will also see the the upside, and will be the first to tell you that the rewards far outweigh the challenges."

In our new series, Sit Down and Start Up, we sit down with our Gray Scalable consultants to talk more about what we do best - HR solutions for start-up and growth stage companies. In today’s post, Lucia Smith, a Human Resources Consultant, defines culture, discusses its importance and dives deeper into how early orgs can build a strong, authentic culture that represents the company.
What is culture?
Culture is your company’s social order – your attitudes, behaviors, and mindsets. It is not: your swag or your parties or random fun perks you offer, though they may be an extension of the decisions that root your culture.
So how do you build a culture?
Purposefully. Culture absolutely starts from the top, with your company’s founder and also any early employees or senior leadership.
When you build a culture it’s not about brainstorming phrases that you think reflect your company or its values (though those are obviously related). Separately, your defined culture needs to be authentic and true; if it’s too aspirational it simply won’t stick. So it’s not five sexy words you write on a meeting room wall - it’s the reality of what it’s like to work at your company day in and day out. You need to sit down and think about what actions or behaviors or ways of getting things done you want to lift up, and which you want to define as problematic. Ask yourself: What are the things you prioritize? How do you celebrate wins? How do you want to approach work as a team? Those ultimately add up to your culture.
It’s never too early to think about this– the norms you set for even one other employee have a snowball effect and it’s much easier to steer a canoe than a cruise ship. When you’re small is a great time to think about what you care about, how you want to behave – making those decisions before you’re in any specific situation makes it easier to live up to your ideals when the going gets tough, or chaotic, or both. Equally important, you want to hire people who will lift up and add to your culture and to do that you need to first define it for yourself. Don’t panic if you’re mid-sized and are just now thinking decisively about culture - as long as your take a strong stance it’s possible to set new norms, and sometimes you need to see what happens naturally to make sure your culture really is authentic when you define it.
So what does good culture look like?
There is no single “good” culture, and because it comes authentically from leadership and early employees, no culture will exactly mirror any other (nor should it).
That said, in a very broad sense here’s what I personally think are tenets of a good culture:
1) Trust: There’s a bias toward sharing information – you trust your people and they trust you to handle info. There are companies that believe every.single.conversation. should be public knowledge. They record every convo, make every meeting public in the name of transparency. To be clear, that’s not what I’m suggesting here. To me, that’s not trust, that’s transparency - and there’s a huge difference. I’ve seen companies falter and have to pivot, but come out strong because they ultimately told their employees what was going on. They didn’t share every financial happening or decision being made, but gave weekly updates on the big picture situation, how they were thinking, and why - and took questions. That’s trust - that your employees can handle info, and roll with it when it changes.
2) Empathy: You consider each other as much as or more than you do your customers, you put yourself in others’ shoes, and you seek first to understand. Some founders have great products and really care about their customers but then undercut their employees and don’t think very deeply about it. It’s an issue to preach and monetize feminism as a brand, but have poor family leave offerings, or to be a vocal supporter of transparency with customers but avoid Q&As with employees. If your insides don’t match your outsides, you have a problem.
3) Respect: Everyone respects each other’s time, their motivations, and their intellect. One of the most common complaints I hear from employees at companies is their time is not respected. I’ve seen employee engagement rise simply by mandating that meetings start on time and have agendas or are automatically canceled. Not everything you do has to be rocket science.
4) Humility: You succeed and fail as a unit, you give credit to others, share successes, analyze failures, and support those who are struggling. This can be as small as noting who made a presentation or just thanking someone for doing something even if it’s their job. There are also great stories of companies sending underrepresented employees to accept awards, or ring the stock market bell when they go public. A culture of humility is one in which it’s understood that you’re in it together when things go south and that you’ll shout their names next to yours when things go north.
5) You operate inclusively and ethically and the company puts in effort to make sure all employees are seen, heard, and supported. In short, unless a culture is good for everyone, it’s not a good culture.
Once you’ve established your culture how do you protect it?
There’s two parts to this: First, you have to share with your team what kind of culture you believe in (aka: set the norms). Then you have to hold yourself and everyone accountable to it. Strictly.
There’s a great article called Your Culture is Who You Hire, Fire, and Promote. It highlights an issue many companies run into: they say they believe certain things, but signal in subtle and un-subtle ways that they actually believe completely different things. If you ask people to share information but hold onto info as a leader, your culture is one of hiding information. If you tell everyone you believe in independence but promote a star performer who micromanages, you believe in micromanaging (even if you’re secretly coaching that person to act otherwise). Actions, as we know, speak louder than words. And culture is nothing but actions on repeat.
Be vigilant about the systems and processes you put in place, especially as you grow and become more successful – for each decision, run it through a filter of “does this match or expand upon the culture I want?” Separately, ask for feedback and ask for it from a wide variety of sources. A healthy culture has checks and balances, and considers and supports all types of people. Ask a wide variety of people what they think a good culture is and what they need from the company. Even if you’re quite small you can still ask friends, family, the internet. The greatest way to protect your culture is to stay curious, to hold yourself accountable to your ideals, and to ask others to do the same.

70,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2019/1/29/offers-are-coming,"January’s “new year, new you” phenomenon applies not only to New Year’s resolutions about fitness and nutrition, but to reinvigorating your career. If that lead you to a search for a new role this year, you’re not alone.
When I speak with both active and passive candidates - especially this time of year, and especially in this hiring market - I counsel them to be prepared to make some choices, and probably faster than they thought when they first started their search. The time to think about navigating job offers is at the start of your search, so that you’re ready to field one, two, or several offers.
Once you’ve reached that point, there's something exhilarating about thinking about a resignation conversation - especially if you're particularly unhappy in your current role. It's tempting to rush to take whichever offer is - at the face of it - the ""best"". The most money, the most prestige, the most desirable company. But, take a breath, and take a step back. What might seem at the surface to be the ""best"" offer might not be the best offer for you. Why did you interview in the first place? What's your biggest motivator? What are the intrinsic things that matter most to you? Match the answers to those questions to the opportunities in front of you, and hopefully, a clear winner emerges.
Assess Culture
At the start of your search, you've ideally put some real thought into what kind of culture will help you bring your best self to work. Make sure the interview process was a two-way street - did you ask all the questions you needed to about the culture of the organizations you're considering? Do you really know what your future boss will value in his/her employees? Consider doing a backdoor reference of your boss.
Know your value
Now is the time to look at each offer in-hand versus market data - and to do some fact-based negotiation. Sanity-check your offers against publicly-available information about salary, and make sure you know how to ask for what you need, if you feel the offers aren't competitive.
But...Don't get seduced by money
Money isn't everything. Look at each offer holistically. How do they compare to each other versus things like quality of life, benefits, interesting work, stability, career development, mentorship?
Assess your risk profile
Size and stage of organization matter a lot - an early stage startup will offer things an established, large company can't. But those larger orgs likely offer more cash. You've probably already thought about this, but now that things have gotten real - it's time to balance how much risk versus guaranteed cash you really need.
Talk to your Board of Directors
This is your personal Board of Directors, the people who are there to help make the tough decisions when you’re stuck. These are people who you can count on for honest advice when you still might be fixated on the most money or the coolest office. Your board of directors might help you see things from a different point of view, they could raise a new concern or even simply offer insight that you aren’t able to give yourself.
So, brace yourself - these offers are coming. Ask yourself the tough questions, and congrats in advance for making a great career move!

71,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2019/12/10/10-more-new-hires-in-6-months-what-do-you-do,"Is this a familiar situation?
You’re in charge of People, or Talent, or People and Talent at a fast-growing startup, and you spend a lot of time and energy on startup recruiting. You just found out you need 10 more engineering hires than you were expecting - and ideally they should all be hired in the next quarter. Your CEO says this is business critical.
What do you do? Consider the options:
Keep things the same - add to your current team’s workload
Hire another recruiter
Consider 3rd party options
Option 1: Just do more.
Unless you and your team have a lot of excess capacity, such as a whole person doing nothing, it’s really unlikely that option 1 will work for your organization. Something’s got to give, in order for option 1 to work, such as deprioritizing hiring for another area of the business, which is unlikely a viable plan during a time of fast growth. Your CEO has given you a mandate - you should be committing additional resources to ensure it’s successful. Asking everyone to work more, or taking on more yourself, may feel heroic in the moment, but it’s not sustainable, and it won’t work. Hope is not a plan.
So let’s consider options 2 and 3:
Option 2: Hire another recruiter.
If you expect to have ongoing hiring at this new volume, you should definitely hire another recruiter. Good in-house resources are the best solution for long term hiring. However keep in mind that hiring good recruiters takes about as long as hiring a good engineer - which is a long time. Great recruiters are in high demand, and it's worthwhile hard work to hire them. Whoever you hire will not be in place for a quarter, and won't be making hires at volume until a quarter after starting. You might be tempted to lower your standard by hiring a readily available but unproven tech recruiter, but don't. You risk missing your targets, and more importantly, you risk damaging your employment brand. Your situation requires a more immediate solution that you can run in parallel with your search for a full time qualified recruiter.
Check out our blog: Scalable Hiring: Improving the Candidate Experience
Option 3: Consider third-party partners.
In parallel to hiring for your team, if you’ll have sustained need, now is a good time to consider your third-party options. Bringing in a third-party solution can be a daunting proposition for many heads of talent in start-ups. You’re scrappy, ambitious and results-oriented, and you have a strong inclination to take everything on internally. However, knowing when to bring in third party help during workload spikes is not a sign of weakness, it is a reflection of strategic thinking about real solutions for challenging problems. Partner with other stakeholders in your company, the head of finance, the CTO - and present the facts and the available options and pros and cons.
There are three kinds of third parties to consider:
Contract Recruiters
Agencies
Embedded Recruiting support
Aren’t contract recruiters an easy fix?
If only it were that easy. This sounds like a great answer, from a cost standpoint, since it’s a non-committed resource you can turn on and off as needed. But, if you haven’t yet learned this the hard way, talk to some of your peers that have: there aren’t many contractors out there, particularly in tech recruiting, that will give you the productivity you need. The hiring process takes about as long as hiring a full-time employee - and many contractors aren’t career-contractors, and would prefer a full time job - so you may as well just do that, and use other third party resources in the meantime. And, if you’re really not ready to hire a full time employee, and hire a contractor anyway, you run the risk of the contractor leaving for an internal role elsewhere.
Use an agency (or 2, or 3…)
Contingent agencies have a place in the recruiting mix. Some agency recruiters have good experience and strong networks, and can provide you with some good candidates. They’re a useful way to supplement your sourcing channels.
However - this is not a reliable solution, as they only do part of the job of hiring. Those good candidates they have presented to you are being shopped to 5 other companies to increase the agency’s odds of placement.
Contingency recruiters have no real commitment to helping you versus helping any other company - their primary objective is getting their candidate hired fastest, but not necessarily by you. Basically, your interests and theirs are not aligned, and mutual success is almost random. They might get you a couple of good hires - but not all or most of them. And, to increase your odds, you probably need to work with a few of them to get some success. Someone on your team will spend a fair amount of time just managing these relationships, which can become almost a full-time job in itself, further distracting from other internal hiring needs.
Have you tried (or even heard of?) embedded recruiting?
The founders of Gray Scalable have been in your shoes multiple times. As HR/talent leaders, we knew the limitations of all the options. We ultimately succeeded in our roles by building great internal teams - but when we started Gray Scalable eight years ago, our mission was to figure out how to provide the same level, results, and value that great internal teams bring - but immediately to our clients and without long-term commitment. In other words, what would a really good third party solution look like?
Embedded recruiting means that our teams become an extension of yours, during the time of the engagement. We immerse in your culture, by working onsite, and by partnering directly with hiring managers, interviewers, and members of the People team. We’re a blend of an internal team and a third party. Essentially, when we started Gray Scalable, we gave ourselves a goal: can we really provide a best-of-both-worlds solution?
We think so! Our model includes:
A commitment to making the hires you need
We’re in it with you, managing roles holistically - not just providing top-of-funnel sourcing support. Unlike agencies, we won’t turn off the tap if things aren’t going well - we’ll work with you on all aspects of the recruiting process, to troubleshoot and advise on best practices, identify and solve your hiring obstacles, and commit to getting the job done.
A working partnership to build sustainable practices
We’re meant to be a short-term solution, but we build long-term practices. We partner with internal teams to build sustainable interviewing and hiring frameworks, and help create a culture of recruiting within your organization.
Some of our clients bring us in when they haven’t yet selected their ATS, for example. We make it our business to know and understand the latest HR SaaS offerings, and will help with rollout of ATSes, like Greenhouse, to help drive adoption and use. We also have a compensation practice at Gray Scalable and can provide market-based advice on competitive salaries in the fast-changing world of tech hiring.
Managing all channels of hiring
By managing the entire pipeline of a requisition, we give your organization the best chance at hiring the best people for your roles. Unlike agencies, we drive and manage your inbound candidate pool, your internal referral program, and engage in outbound sourcing. We help you hire the best candidate - not “our” candidate - removing unnecessary bias (and conflict) from the hiring process.
While we do believe our model sets our clients up to make the best hires at scale, we also understand it is different and can take some getting used to. To be successful our model also requires true partnership and engagement from our clients - so, before taking on an engagement, we will encourage a mutual assessment of fit.
These successful partnerships are what motivate us every day, and we’ve been fortunate to work with many of the leading tech companies in NYC and elsewhere. One example: Two years ago, we meet with Luke Vnenchak at BuzzFeed about growing their engineering team and ended up partnering in many ways with one of our all-time biggest clients. Luke sent us this note about the team he’d been working with a year later:
Gray Scalable has been a true partner for us as we've grown our engineering team. They have given great advice on process that is catered specifically to our strengths and challenges as an organization. The diversity on our teams has increased as we have worked with them, and I have a ton of confidence in how they communicate with candidates throughout the hiring experience.

It can be difficult to get started in any new place, especially when that new place is a brand new company, where you’ve just started an entirely new role. There is always a rush of emotions when it comes to starting a new job - you’re happy to be done with your search, excited at the prospect of a new job and new company, nervous to meet all of your colleagues and scared at the prospect of doing something different. But sit back and take a breath, some of our Gray Scalable team members are sharing their tips, tricks and experiences for starting a new job and fitting in at a brand new organization.
Don’t be afraid to try new things
“Starting at a new company is always an exciting mix of emotions - you’re eager to learn and meet new people, but you’re a little anxious to fit in justttt the right way. One of the biggest tips I’ve found is to sit in on any meeting you can, no matter which department. It’s a great way to see how everyone operates, meet everyone in the company and hey, you never know where you’ll end up in a few years.
For a more ~general~ rule, don’t be afraid to try new things. See how your new company does things, whether that’s in or out of the office, and get excited to try something uncomfortable. If it makes you feel a bit out of your comfort zone, you’re probably doing it right.”
- Lauren Kane, Technical Recruiting Coordinator
New coworkers are great resources
“Get to know your coworkers and leverage them as your resources! I can't stress that enough. It's a great way to knowledge share with one another and collaborate on creative solutions when you're feeling stuck.
I wasn't completely new to the tech industry [when I joined Gray Scalable], but I was starting a role that was new to me. There was definitely somewhat of a learning curve in terms of familiarizing myself with best practices, trends of the industry and creative strategies. It really helped me to sit down with a couple members of our team who have worked through different situations and learned from their past experiences. From the most practical advice to some really unique and unconventional approaches, it was a great opportunity to put it in practice and stretch new ideas from conversations and actual working sessions with one another.”
- Nadine Kim, Associate Technical Recruiter
Don’t rush through the first few weeks
“One of the hardest parts of starting a new job for me is being ok with ramp up time. Although you may be an expert in your field, every company is different, so it’s ok to take things slow and learn your new company’s ‘best practices’ and ‘rules of the road.’ Don’t worry if it seems like you aren’t making an impact right away, it takes time to digest all of the processes in your new role.
I started at Gray Scalable right before the holidays. It was a great time to start at a new company because as things were slowing down toward the end of the year, it gave me an opportunity to do a lot of self-study work, and spend quality time with my teammates. It was the perfect way to set up for success to hit the ground running in Q1. That being said, it was hard to hold off until the new year to really feel like I was making an impact on the team, but once we were in the full swing of things, I was thankful for the preparation time I put in throughout December. ”
- Sydney Gitelson, Recruiting Consultant
Once you’ve settled in at your new company, don’t forget to update your LinkedIn profile, send a thank you to those who helped you along the way and enjoy yourself. Congratulations on the new job!"

Four years ago Charlie and Deb took a chance on a girl who knew she wanted to utilize her skills in an environment that inspired her and provided mentorship. I’ve been along for the incredible journey of seeing Gray Scalable go from a team of 4 to 30 and I am so proud of our brand and what we do for everyone we work with. I never thought I would find a job that I wake up and look forward to going to every day. When first working in the hustle and bustle of NYC, I knew I needed an environment that would both challenge me and nurture me - but also wasn't sure how to reconcile the two. Little did I know, Gray Scalable was the opportunity that would change my mind on all that.
At Gray Scalable, we have an environment where I have been able to come in and learn from the best HR consultants and recruiters in NYC. I have collaborated across all areas of our business, helping grow a lot of the amazing companies we work with.
Of all these things, my favorite thing to do is to pay it forward and recruit for new members of our team. I know how life-changing it is to work in an environment that values and respects their employees. I'm not exaggerating by saying there's something incredibly gratifying to recruit for something I so strongly believe could change someone's professional and personal life for the better.
So now, I get to be a part of growing us from 4 to 30 to 40 and beyond. As we gear up to move into our brand new office next month in Flatiron, we’re expanding the team even more! We're hiring for several positions across our company. If you know someone who is searching for the next great thing, shoot me a note, and check out our open jobs page!"

At Gray Scalable, we consult on all things hiring for different tech companies - early to late stage, B2C, B2B, FinTech, SportsTech, FarmTech - you name it. As part of our work we’re almost always asked to help with building or improving the employment brand for the company, especially as it relates to hiring for technical roles.
Often, companies have difficulty getting started with the overall strategy, most notably with the content part of it, and get stuck trying to figure out who has the time to edit and maintain career sites, photos, videos, etc.... All of this critically important, and things we like to help our clients with. One critical part of branding we often see left out of the conversation, are the recruiting messages.
Recruiting messages (emails, InMails… etc) are often viewed as only a “just in time” strategy deployed to hire a specific person for a specific role immediately. While this is an important tactic to help make hires, we view it differently at Gray Scalable. Investing budget in branding and creating content is challenging to begin with because it’s hard to predict what’s going to work. A great employment brand starts and ends with the quality of your recruiting messages.
Being that my team is comprised of tech recruiters - not marketers, we tend to stick to our guns and leverage messaging to figure out what works and what doesn’t with a client’s brand. We’ve learned that by combining a direct and consistent approach to recruitment messaging with a little patience, we can more clearly figure out what is resonating with candidates and helping to shape the view of our client’s organizations.
GETTING STARTED ON THE RIGHT FOOT
First, there are technical things great recruiters do, like make sure to select and target the right candidates to reach out to. Sr. Back-End Engineers who have Java experience aren’t thrilled hearing about Junior Javascript Front-End Developer roles. Second, we try not to treat each message as a magic bullet, but rather an opportunity to start, continue or finish telling a story over a short series of messages that increases the chances of conversion in the short term and builds brand equity for the long term.
A lot of recruitment messaging out there presents an insecure, jumbled message bragging about things like funding, celebrity investors or perks and have nothing to do with what a candidate may care about or experience on the job. In tech now more than ever, candidates see right through this. How they think about their jobs, careers, and work is also becoming diverse - candidates are looking for personalized opportunities they can feel good about that will drive their ambitions forward. We find that the best employment branding simplifies and prioritizes what is uniquely valuable about what your company can offer a candidate. Mixing the right combination of what you can offer in your messaging helps candidates connect the personalized journey they want to take, with what you have to offer.
BUILD A BRAND WITH CONSISTENT MESSAGING
Across all of our technical hiring engagements there is interplay between employment branding, sourcing candidates and making hires (especially hiring engineers). While we work closely with the hiring manager on outreach strategy and measure messaging conversion performance to hit short term goals (hires!), we also stress the importance of building your brand through messaging for long term impact.
It can be challenging for us, and frustrating for them to try to work through why candidates are not responding to really great messaging that has proven to work in the past at other companies for similar job requirements. The important thing is, everyone is working on conversion, but not on compromising the opportunity to build a brand through messaging. What we have found works best for both short and long term goals, is to create a consistent messaging structure and stick to it. Apply this thinking to 3-5 messages over 6-8 weeks and you’ve set a good first impression for each candidate as to what your company has to offer, whether you convert them or not. You are now building brand equity!
THE ANATOMY OF CONSISTENT MESSAGING
When we start with a new client, we try to help prioritize and simplify their brand story. We typically try to narrow it down to five key pillars of opportunity that their company has to offer:
With some agreement internally about what to focus on and prioritize, companies can really start to unlock the magic of using employment branding to attract great engineering talent while laying the foundation to educate candidates in the marketplace for long term brand building. Whether you use all or just one of the pillars is up to you, but we generally recommend focusing on your top two for shorter term conversion impact, and pairing a top pillar with others to start to build a complete brand story over time.
BRAND BUILDING TECH RECRUITING MESSAGES ARE JUST THE BEGINNING
I often tell clients to think of each recruiting message as just one part of the story you are telling candidates. If you prioritize and sequence how you talk about your tech team and company opportunities over several messages to the same candidates on a reasonable cadence, you automatically start to tell your story. You’ll get a few short term conversions along the way and will start to see the impact of building your brand over time and learn what works and what doesn’t. We see messaging as the fire starter for all the other work your recruiting team and/or hiring managers should be doing to build your brand.
When you are known as THE company that is unique because of it’s People, Stage, Stack, Product or Mission... you can thank your messaging strategy for planting the roots of your overall employment brand. Build out a plan, prioritize and stick to it and in due time, you’ll start integrating your messaging pillars into other branding content and notice your hiring teams leveraging it out at meetups, in video interviews, social posts, etc… A consistent brand message becomes memorable and is the key to unlocking better quality candidates and producing stronger technical hiring results on a faster timeline.

75,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2019/7/9/exploding-offers,"Exploding Offers: Check Yourself Before You Wreck Yourself
We love celebrations here at Gray Scalable. We celebrate Scalaversaries, birthdays, take your kids to work day, and on occasion, Taco Tuesday. If the celebration includes Magnolia cupcakes, even better, IMO.
By far, my favorite thing to celebrate is each time we make a hire for one of our clients. As seasoned recruiters, however, we know when it’s time to celebrate, and when not to: we won’t celebrate a hire until we’ve received a signed offer letter. Call it recruiter-paranoia, but it’s real: no posting to our internal #Woo-Hoo Slack channel until the offer letter comes back signed. No cupcakes until the candidate has signed on the...docusign.
It’s a big thing, getting that signature. We’ve worked hard in partnership with our clients, and it feels great to know that hard work has paid off. We’re fans of helping our clients get from verbal offer to letter-signature as quickly as possible, so it might be surprising to hear that we’re not fans of a practice that has become pretty popular: extending offers that have a near-term expiration date, also more popularly known as exploding offers.
To be clear: there’s a big difference between an exploding offer, and a request for a candidate not to sit on an offer. An exploding offer is one that expires and is rescinded by a date that is usually a week (or even fewer days) from the date the letter is sent to the candidate.
On the face of it - exploding offers seem like a good idea. They give a candidate a specific length of time to take or decline the offer in front of them. They give clarity that offers are not out there for infinite consideration (or for infinite shopping around). As a hiring manager, you’ll get a faster decision, and can manage other candidates in the mix faster. But, an exploding offer can be, well, a land-mine. Here’s why I recommend you avoid them.
They set an adversarial tone
When you set that short, hard-and-fast deadline, you’re signaling it’s not up for debate: and therefore, you’re not interested in any extenuating circumstances.
When you make an offer - you’re delivering what you hope to be the best and welcome news. You’re kicking off a manager-employee relationship on a positive note. It’s not the time to be an adversary - more boss-y and forceful than you would be in a normal work situation. Remember, your offer might be one of several - or even many. Now is the time to really sell the opportunity - not to apply an arbitrary deadline and needless pressure.
You’ll get an answer - but it might not be the one you want.
When you set a deadline for an answer - you’ll get an answer. But be careful what you push for. Forcing a candidate to give you an answer before s/he’s ready might either force a no - or a false yes, that could result in you stopping recruiting, and the candidate then backing out and taking a preferred, competing offer.
They hurt your hiring brand
The impulse to push for fast answers is a natural response to a highly competitive hiring market. But that impulse might do more damage to your hiring brand, and your overall ability to close candidates. It communicates a driver- or micromanager-culture that might not be a reflection of your overall company culture.
Here’s what to do in lieu of extending an exploding offer:
Show Empathy
This is a big decision for the candidate. Show that you understand and appreciate the care s/he’s putting into evaluating whether or not to join your team. Acknowledge you know that you’re not the only game in town, and that the candidate deserves multiple offers. You’d greatly prefer s/he join your company - but that you want that decision made as a no-looking-back one.
Ask for a Decision Timeframe
Asking for a decision timeframe is very different from demanding an answer on your own timeline. This is an opportunity to pressure-test how you will work with your future employee, when you need to do some negotiating around project deliverables, family vacations, etc. It’s OK to ask why a candidate needs time - and to help remove any barriers to the candidate saying yes.
Accept a Decline
After exploring the reasons your candidate might need extra time making a decision - you might come to the conclusion that you’re not OK waiting, and that you would ultimately been OK with forcing a decision, and getting a possible decline. That’s OK! And it’s also OK to communicate that to the candidate, saying that, at a certain point, you need a go or no go - so that you can move on and consider all your options.
At the end of it all, the time between offer extension and decision is a critical point in the recruiting process. Don’t get in your own way by inserting a false deadline that could end up working against you. This is the time to have an open dialogue with your (hopefully!) future employee - not the time to make them feel coerced into making a decision before they’re ready.

A common scenario I hear from managers is that an employee will come to them and essentially say “I want to grow,” hoping their manager will figure out how to make this vague directive happen. The manager then tries to give more feedback than usual, but the employee doesn’t feel anything concrete is happening. Both sides grow frustrated, usually ending in some form of blow up during a 1–1 or review. So the manager comes to me and asks:
“How am I actually supposed to help my team develop other than showing them how to do their job better?”
Good question. Here’s how.
First, get curious.
This seems like it would be intuitive, but many managers skip over this step and get right into a prescriptive set of goals or a plan, usually based on their own path. But that misses the mark on multiple fronts: Your idea of success might be different than your employee’s, AND you miss the chance to strengthen your relationship by being a good listener.
So what do you get curious about? The most direct route is to ask about your employee’s past and their future. This is from a workshop I’ve done with clients:
When discussing their future, it’s important the conversation be genuine and rooted in reality. Just because you are supporting someone in their growth doesn’t mean that you can make anything they want happen.
Second, create the right environment.
Your job as a manager is not just to train everyone that reports to you (frankly, many of them are probably better at certain things than you are); your job is to enable them. So how do you do that?
Give them the space they need to get the job done. Make sure that you put your employees in situations where they can actually stretch and prove themselves to you and other leadership in the company. Too often I hear stories of employees being told they need to lead a presentation or own a project to get promoted, only to never be allowed to do those things because they haven’t done them before. Also be cognizant of what’s realistic for them to get done— your job as a manager is to advocate for your team’s skills and do whatever you can to protect their time.
Ensure they’re accountable to make and act on their own decisions.It’s common to think: “If someone on my team comes to me with a question and I tell them what I would do, I’m teaching them how to think about the problem.” But what’s actually happening is that you’re teaching them to come to you for answers. If you’re going to promote someone or have them take on new things they need to show both you and themselves they can make decisions when uncertain. Obviously you can serve as a resource to bounce around ideas or approaches (and curb them as needed), but make it clear they’re accountable for their own decisions.
Don’t confuse your way of doing things with the right way of doing things. As we get more senior we become more confident in our ideas. We’re also much more likely to pattern match, thinking that because something has always been done a certain way it should continue to be done that way. Be open minded about how heavy of a hand you should use when giving guidance or approving/nixing plans. This is another opportunity to get curious: What interesting new routes can your employees think of? Do they need to be redirected or just supported? (Note: sometimes challenging someone is a version of supporting them.)
Third, help them set goals.
Setting goals can be scary and ambiguous, especially when the growth options aren’t clear in a company. Most employees just know that want to “become more senior” or “get better” or “do more.” Here’s a simple breakdown of the types of goals someone can set to help you guide their (and your) thoughts:
Types of Goals Someone Can Set
Performance
If there’s a skills gap between where they are and where they want to be (or where you want them to be), what can they do to improve? What are tactical actions they can take?
Growth
What experiences will help them grow toward their career goals? What skills do they want in their toolbox for the future? This may not be something directly related to what they want to do, but rather something that will help them be well rounded as they get more senior.
Opportunity
What are some new areas for them to master? What opportunities can they have to try new things?
Training
What are the opportunities to shadow or learn from others? What tools or trainings can they access?

As a Recruiter, my day is spent assessing whether or not someone, as a candidate, would be a fit for a role within an organization. I’m essentially a career matchmaker. So you can imagine, as a single woman, the last thing I want to do when I get home from work is be a romantic matchmaker for myself. Scrolling through a profile on LinkedIn is painfully similar to scrolling through profiles on one of the multiple dating apps I have on my phone, and I’m not here for it. Or should I be? Maybe applying more of what works with recruiting could also work with dating since there are so many parallels already. Here’s how I see it...
Step 1: Sourcing + Swiping
There are multiple boxes that get checked in the first 5-10 seconds of viewing both my future husband’s profile as well as a candidate’s profile. Starting with the basics-
Location
Education
Open to new opportunities- much easier to determine on a dating app vs LinkedIn
Detailed profile
Correct grammar
If *most* of these boxes get checked, there’s no harm in reaching out and sending a LinkedIn message - or swiping right. If there is a match - it’s time for our first-date-slash-interview.
Step 2: Coordinating and Corresponding
This step can really make or break what happens next - and a lot of the time ends up being the dealbreaker in both dating and recruiting. There’s an expectation of flexibility on both parties. Meeting outside of typical working hours if it’s a date, and being able to step away from your office for a few hours for an interview. It’s at this stage in both dating and interviewing where there is sometimes drop off. In both scenarios, neither of us are looking for a penpal, and time is money in recruiting. I’m flexible to rescheduling once, but anything more than that makes me question your interest - as a husband or candidate.
As we start to correspond and coordinate, ""candidate crushes"" and real life crushes start to develop. There’s nothing better than when a candidate or first date is easy to schedule, replies promptly to emails/texts, sends several options for availability, and answers all of my requests. I always love a good exclamation point too!
Step 3: The Onsite Interview and The First Date
First rounds of interviews last anywhere from 30-45 minutes, versus first dates that tend to be a bit longer, but not always! Both events start pretty similarly - how was your weekend? Did you travel at all this summer? What do you want to drink? It’s because of these daily professional conversations that I would give myself a 10/10 on breaking the ice. I could keep a conversation going with a wall, and smile through the whole thing. Why I’m still single, I just don’t know.
In New York, it is against the law for recruiters to ask candidates what their current salary is, so instead I typically ask how they would like to be compensated in their next role. Although it isn’t illegal, I wouldn’t recommend bringing up salary or financial goals on a first...or second date. If things go well, we move forward to the next round of interviews-slash-dates which are longer, involve more resources, and have a slightly increased sense of pressure.
There’s less small talk and more: do you want kids? Are you looking for a long term relationship? Have you started to picture yourself working here? It’s a bigger commitment of time, and we’re both still exploring the opportunity and assessing if we have a future together- romantic or professional. After all, Interviewing Avenue and Dating Court are two way streets. Both parties need to feel the love or there is no future for either relationship.
Step 4: Getting Serious...or not. Just Don’t Ghost.
We’ve come to the end of the road- or rather a fork in the road. Do we make it official with an offer? Decide that we should be exclusive and delete those pesky apps from our phone? Or do we go our separate ways? Rejecting someone from a job opportunity is never easy, but more often than not it ends with a genuine hope that our paths cross again in the future. Let’s just be friends hasn’t gone over as well in dating.
Agnostic of how things end, ghosting your Recruiter or your date is never ok. You have to pay to play so own it and have the tough conversation! Why is ghosting even a thing? Stay tuned for my thoughts on that at another time.
For the most part I’m happy to say this is where my recruiting relationships usually flourish. There are job offers made, high fives all around, a shout out in our Slack #WOOHOO channel etc. Of course there are more rejections than hires, but the hires do come in pretty frequently. If I could say the same about my love life I wouldn’t be writing this blog post. It’s been a mix of rejection and rejecting, so until the right candidate comes along, I’ll just keep swiping.

78,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2020/2/12/top-tips-for-hiring-managers,"Your team is growing, and you couldn’t be more excited - maybe a little nervous too, because as the hiring manager, you're ultimately responsible for making awesome hires for your team. You’ll be fine! Once you've synced up with your internal recruiting partner (if you have one!) on the job description, requirements, and general strategy, it's time to think more about how to find the right candidate, who will be a culture add at your org. Start your hiring process off on the right foot with these tips from some of the GS team:
Make hiring a top priority
“Recognize and acknowledge that hiring is now a part of your day to day responsibilities. The recruiter will guide you in any way that they can, but ultimately, this is your decision and it takes work. Dedicate time on your calendar everyday to sourcing, interviewing, writing/reviewing feedback, etc. You are the one who decides who fills that seat”
- Brigid Wixted, Technical Recruiting Consultant
Communication is key
“Treat the relationship with your recruiter as a partnership. Be as communicative and transparent as you can, and hold your recruiter to that same standard. The more honest and open you are, the better your recruiter will be able to find the right talent for your team.”
- Katie Moriarty, Business Recruiting Consultant
Be Realistic
Katie adds, “remember to be as realistic as possible when hiring, both from a timing and a skill-set perspective. One of the mistakes I see most frequently is when hiring managers want to target candidates who are overqualified for the job, typically because they feel this requires the least amount of time training and onboarding for the candidate. But doing so actually causes a ripple effect: if you're hiring at a more-senior level versus others on the team, you'll create pay disparity, and might upset those who are in peer-roles to the new hire. It also arguably makes hiring needlessly harder, if you're looking for someone who comes in with zero development areas. Remember that it's ok to hire people who will grow and develop into their role for a few years.
Market your open roles
“Seek out creative ways to promote your open position. The goal is to get more eyes and clicks on your job description to cast a wider net for applicants. Your internal team of colleagues each have individual networks of viable talent... Request that they share your job description on Linkedin and social media channels. In addition, if your company has a social media following, ask your marketing team to share as well. Creating a buzz about your organization having new opportunities and being a great place to work is good for you as a hiring manager and good for your employer’s brand.”
- Lauren Barnes, Technical Recruiting Consultant
Preparation is crucial
“Block 15 minutes before and after your interview to prep and fill out your feedback. When filling out your feedback ensure you have enough information that anyone could read it and understand why you made your decision in the future.”
- Mallory Mazer, Human Resources Consultant
Candidate experience is everything
Mallory continues, “even if you know a candidate is not a good fit for your organization, they could know someone who is and you want to ensure they are saying great things about your org and your team. Candidates are interviewing you just as much as you are interviewing them.”
Be Thoughtful About Reference Checking
“I’m surprised when hiring teams propose we skip reference checking. While I get their perspective - of course, candidates are going to serve up people who will definitely say nice things about them - that doesn’t mean there’s no value in conducting them. You can still learn useful things from past managers, colleagues, and direct reports of your finalist candidates. Tee up references not as a negative-seeking mission, or reason not to hire someone - but as part of the interview process, and a way to get a more well-rounded view of your candidate’s strengths and areas of development. If you prepare, and ask thoughtful, behavioral questions, you will be surprised at how much valuable information you’ll get, as you make your final candidate selection. You’ll also build your own network, and possibly even source some new candidates while you’re at it! And, if you do want to speak with people other than those your candidate served up, here are some tips for how to handle that (and what to do about backdoor references).”
- Deb Feldman, Co-Founder
Hiring is a daunting process, but know that you're not alone. With the right internal (or external) partners, and armed with these tips - you got this! If you find you need a little more help, give us a call!"
79,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2020/2/27/the-pursuit-my-double-life,"There’s this quote (or some rendition of it) that everyone knows, probably first encountering it when you were very small:
“Do what you love and you’ll never work a day in your life.”
Four years post grad and I’m still on that pursuit. Now, this is not to say that I’m miserable in my day to day, constantly obsessing about the morning I’m able to walk up to the big boss with all 32 shining and a heart full, to state that my dreams are finally coming true (*takes drag*). Truthfully though, it’s quite the contrary - as an HR professional who specializes in talent acquisition in the start-up tech space, I’m exposed to some really cool stuff - I’m talking Tesla before it was Tesla type stuff. Helping others has always been a driving force for my actions and I just happened to fall into a career (it’s true - no one knows what recruiting is until one day they wake up and they are a recruiter) that allows me that and the chance to make some nice coin.
But if we’re being honest, and we are being honest, my true passion is music. I love everything about it and have immersed myself into it for the past four years. And the coolest part is that it’s quickly become a lot more than just a little hobby - my band is booked at prominent NYC venues throughout 2020 (duhh, of course you can come - I’ll throw you some info a lil’ later on) & we’re on the brink of launching our record label (shoutout to the legal team, you know who you are!).
“So, you’re just fumbling through the day waiting for someone to call, telling you to quit your job?”
Not exactly. In fact, I’d say I don’t even “think” about music while I’m getting my recruiting on.
During the day, I’m a recruiter and an HR professional. I work with incredible clients who have dope products and they trust me and my Gray Scalable Team to help scale their engineering, product and HR teams. I’m still learning everyday and have a great team of senior folks who have guided my advancement. (Side “B”) During the evenings, late nights & after hours, I pursue a music career with rigorous drive and passion. That ranges from learning new / practicing old scales on piano to post-production engineering, as well as acting as our band manager and booking agent.
“So, how do you do it all?”
While I’m now comfortable living this double life, it took a couple of years to figure out a system that worked for me and everyone I associate with regularly. So, how did I get to this point - how am I able to manage it all? The answer(s) isn’t that complicated or groundbreaking; organization & sacrifice. My entire day, and most times, my week is mapped out to the t - emails, candidate responses, coordination, sourcing, client & internal meetings - I even have specific windows each day that can be scheduled for candidate calls. My evenings are mapped too, spending different nights focused on distinct development points as a musician and “business development” opportunities for the band. I wrote a while back how my brain is similar to Dug from “Up,” and how with the Pomodoro Technique I’m able to stay in the moment and on top of the task at hand. We all think we’re incredible multi taskers, when often times in actuality, we’re just doing multiple things half as well.
Lately, I’ve realized how similar my two lives are and just how much they blend. In each, there is the same requirement - make the most of each minute while it’s here. I use Skillshare (one of my favorite 2019 clients) to teach myself piano. A lot of the same techniques learned in recruiting are used to find attractive A&R’s, Booking Agents, Venue Heads and various brands to continually promote my band. The tools I’ve picked up in my professional life now directly affect my artistic pursuits - and my artistic pursuits reap the benefits of such.
I’d be extremely remiss if I didn’t point out that I have this flexibility because my company, Gray Scalable (#GrowWithGray), encourages me to pursue my passions. These folks not only ask me how my performances are coming along, but they pull up to the venues to catch the shows. It’s easy to put your best foot forward when you have that kind of support.
So, do you have interests, a passion or dream outside of your 9-5 (they really gotta change that to 8-7, & also, where’s the 4-day work week at??) but aren’t in a position to be fully supported by it yet? My two cents - never stop chasing it - but also remember to engage fully in whatever is in front of you at that time. Make the most of each minute while you have it and watch how much more effective you become. Oh and of course - you’re doing amazing sweetie."
80,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2020/3/10/how-to-make-remote-work-work-for-you,"As the coronavirus continues to spread around the world and especially throughout the United States, it’s more important than ever to prioritize the safety and well-being of your team. As a result, we’re seeing that a lot of our clients and friends are instituting remote work policies and some are even moving their companies to 100% remote work.
Understandably, this can be a difficult transition. Make it a little easier on yourself with these tips from one of our remote teammates, Bec Bliss.
Over-communicate on expectations and deliverables.
Increasing the frequency of communication will keep you and your work visible even if you are out of sight. And when everyone is working separately, they may begin to feel disconnected from one another. More communication will help to keep everyone - including you - stay in the loop and part of the team.
Create boundaries & stick to them!
If you’re working from home, it’s critical to ensure that you have healthy boundaries between your work-life responsibilities and your personal life. Whether that be a location, hours, or some sort of mental check - that delineation is crucial.
Don’t cut yourself off from the rest of the world.
One of the things I miss most about working from the office is the social interactions with colleagues. Apart from scheduling semi regular trips to the central office, I've found that choosing a day or two to co-work from a cafe or shared space can be a nice way to break up the week. Unfortunately this doesn’t work for those actively isolating themselves - instead, try making your next 1:1 or team meeting a Zoom video instead of a conference call.
And finally, be patient.
Having the ability to work remotely can be a phenomenal perk (or sometimes a required reality - COVID19), but like any other change it takes a while to get used to. Before I made the switch, I thought mostly of how much easier it would be to lose the long commute, be ensured a quiet room to take calls and meetings from, and (as much as I loved them) the lack of office friends and distractions sounded like it would make my days free to focus 100% all the time.
The truth was that working remotely did ease up on some of these challenges, but it came with it's own new set of imperfections to contend with. For me, it was the barking storm that arose every time the mailman came to the house and the terrifying realization that I could not order a salad from my desk at 3:00PM if I forgot to take a lunch break. It took some trial and error to sort out how working remotely would logistically work for me. Be kind to yourself as you try out some of these tips and find a way to make remote work successful for you.

Forward by Drew Koloski
On Thursday of last week we just got word that our school district is closing “indefinitely.” We picked up our kids’ Chromebooks on Friday and work will be sent home beginning Monday.
However, our school age kids (ten, eight and five) already had assigned work, given to them by my wife - it’s a short Q&A assignment to learn about the Coronavirus (via a great comic provided by NPR). Not only was it designed to make sure they stay relaxed with the right information, it was a beta test and tone-setter for homeschooling starting this week. My wife is a middle school special education teacher and on a daily-hourly-sometimes-by-the-minute basis she has me totally swooning over her masterful control of our crazy big-little family containing four kids under the age of ten.
With many of us working parents suddenly having to juggle working from home and home schooling, I couldn’t think of a better person to give some advice on how to get started. Without further ado, I offer you the master, at work… (love you honey!)
How to Avoid Homeschool Hell
Written by Kara Koloski
Full disclosure: I am a middle school special education teacher. I will also inevitably have to “work from home,” planning online lessons and offering “office hours” to assist my students. My husband will also be working from home, but he will have less flexibility than I have. Still, I know it’s essential that I set up a system where I can get his help when I really need it.
I am, admittingly, obsessed with being organized and therefore have been thinking about this for several weeks: How will I deal with four kids at home while also having to work? I know that many working parents are thinking the same exact thing and are wondering, “Where do I start?”
Here are three things I recommend to get you and your kids off to a positive start amongst all the change:
Create a schedule. The first and most important thing is to create a schedule with them. I already have a draft built in partnership with my husband. Be sure to add in non-school related activities and exercise, play, etc...
Have a family meeting and allow the kids to contribute to planning the schedule (even though we already pretty much know what it will be). This way they will buy into the schedule more easily. This works, trust me!
Dangle a daily reward. We don’t work for free, so why make our kids do it?! Make your life easy and set up a system that rewards good home schooling behaviors early. For us, it will be video game time.
This may be a lot for some, but for us the schedule includes every hour roughly planned out. This helps our oldest who has ADHD and struggles when our routine changes. It includes set time in the morning for “work” and set time after lunch for “work.” Of course this is new territory so we will see how that plays out exactly. We’ve included meals and snacks in the schedule too.
We’ve also set parameters for video game time to use as a rewards system. In our house, under normal circumstances we do not allow any video games during the week. Obviously we have to be flexible and this serves as a good motivator for the kids to complete their work without too much hassle. As a bonus, it will allow me and my husband to get more, legit uninterrupted work done because our youngest (one year old) will be taking a nice long afternoon nap while the three older ones are glued to their devices.
As an educator, I have never had to work from home, let alone homeschool my kids, but I have spent many summers creating a schedule for us that balances all of our needs. Therefore, my best advice is to create a schedule with the kids on board and be consistent with it. Use video game / device time or something they love as a reward for their school work completed. Yes, you may have a day or two where you will have to potentially take the reward away, but eventually most kids figure out we mean business and give in to the new schedule. Finally, don’t forget about you! As you are building your schedule be sure to understand when you can take a break from it all. You’ll need it to stay sane, and kids will need a break from parents too!
Getting off to a good start with structure they can participate in building, paired with a reward and positivity will help get you through the long days ahead. Good luck, I know we’ll need some ourselves!

82,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2020/3/19/the-wfh-world-of-covid-19,"With almost hourly Covid-19 announcements on closures, new cases, and recommendations, your head may be spinning. Employees are looking for guidance, and we are facing a unique situation where we are figuring out how to handle as we go. How do you manage communication? How do you support your employees? How do you ensure your business goals are still met?
We’re here to help - here are some of our tips:
Be Flexible.
With many employees confined to their homes, they may have partners, roommates and children all trying to fight for space and focus. Acknowledge the difficulty and stress your employees may be facing, and normalize the fact that there might be a child interrupting or partner on the phone in the same room (Mute button for the win on Zoom/Hangouts!). To help, encourage employees to be transparent about their WFH situation, and if possible, support flexible work hours as needed in order to get work done.
Focus on the essentials.
With the changes and many of your employees working from home for the first time, there will be a learning curve! Support getting them up to speed on the basics:
Make sure to provide training and resources when possible on how to best utilize your remote working tools (ex. Zoom training, Slack/Messenger training, sharing expectations, etc.)
Review your project planning, goals, and deadlines coming up - and think realistically whether you will be able to meet them. If not, proactively move deadlines and communicate changes.
Now is also a good time to really think about meeting hygiene, adding agendas, reviewing invite lists and ensuring it makes sense to still have the meeting.
Communication expectations and tips.
With everything changing quickly in these unprecedented times, employers are going to face questions they do not have answers to. You should communicate early and often with your team. Be honest and open to maintain credibility. You may make the wrong choices and need to pivot, but it is still better to be as transparent as you can.
-
Continue (and maybe increase) all hands meetings remotely - Zoom and Google Hangouts are great tools to utilize during this time. Leave time at the end of your all hands meetings for employees to ask questions, don’t be afraid to say “I don’t know, but let me find out” - and make sure you close the loop!
When communicating with your employees, remember to be empathetic while being realistic. Acknowledge uncertainty, but provide structure and leadership. Ex. The office will be closed at minimum until March 20th and we may have to be closed for longer than that.
Commit to when you will revisit issues, ex. We will revisit our mandatory work from home on March 20th.
Don't forget about your managers.
Managers are likely to be feeling stressed as the front line of the adjustment to a remote workforce. Make sure to check-in regularly to see how they are doing. One way to do this is to create a manager slack channel or daily stand up where they can share ideas and challenges.
This is an ongoing and developing situation and we know everything is moving quickly, so we advise everyone to stay informed, stay flexible and stay empathetic. You can find more resources and help regarding the creation of remote work policies and more here.

With Coronavirus (COVID 2019) taking over the news, we’ve been getting lots of questions from clients about what they should say to staff. We’ve put together a template to help companies craft their communication. We work largely with NYC tech and media startups so the below template is geared toward that population, but every company is different (and has a different appetite for risk) so this should only be used as a foundation to work from as you customize your own response. We advise all orgs to adjust as makes sense for your size, your PTO and remote work policies, how your business operates, the types of employees you have and where they work, etc.
COMPANY COMMUNICATIONS
A Template for Coronavirus Response
(Please edit, customize and use as appropriate.)
We’re committed to the safety and well being of our team, and as part of that the PeopleOps and Leadership teams have been monitoring the spread of coronavirus (COVID-2019). Best practice in these situations is not to panic but to have a plan ready should it be necessary, and to take proactive precautions. We are implementing the following guidelines as a precaution to protect everyone and maintain work continuity as the situation evolves. If you have any questions, please reach out to a member of the PeopleOps or Leadership team.
Keeping Yourself and Others Healthy
The most effective thing any of us can do is wash our hands frequently and avoid touching our eyes, mouth, and nose. We will put up a few reminder posters around the office, but please remember:
When washing your hands, make sure to do it with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds (that’s commonly referred to as two rounds of the happy birthday song, if that’s helpful).
Utilize the hand sanitizer that we have put around the office. This is meant as a supplement to washing your hands, not a replacement. It’s always best to wash your hands thoroughly.
Cough and sneeze in your elbow, not on your hands.
It’s not too late to get your flu shot! This is optional, but highly recommended.
The second most effective thing we can do is to stay home if we are sick. We are expanding our sick and WFH policy to be more flexible right now. This means:
If you are coughing or feel otherwise sick, please alert your manager and plan to work from home. This is to protect your team, as well as make sure you get the rest you need so please don’t try to be a “hero.” If you are too sick to work from home, please take the time off that you need. If you are out of sick days please speak to PeopleOps and we will figure out accommodations.
We are also amping up our office cleanings, including putting disinfectant wipes around the office so it’s easy to wipe down door knobs, handles, and other frequently touched places. Please do so!
Business and Personal Travel
We’re taking our cues from the CDC guidelines for travel. These guidelines are updated frequently, and this policy will follow suit. Currently:
Business Travel
We are cancelling all non-essential business travel to areas listed by the CDC as Level 1 or 2 and keeping careful watch on travel to Level 3 areas. If you need to travel to a Level 1 or 2 area you will be asked to work from home for 14 days post-travel. If you need to travel to a Level 3 area we are following CDC guidelines and asking you to stay away from anyone exhibiting illness, to wash your hands, and to track your own health for 14 days post-travel. We realize not everyone can work from home; if that is true for you please speak to your manager and a member of PeopleOps so we can help you figure out what to do given your specific circumstances.
If you have a work-related trip planned and you are uncomfortable traveling please speak to a member of PeopleOps so we can make alternate plans/accommodations. If you are required to travel for work and are not allowed to return home for some reason, the company will support you to the extent possible, including allowing you to work remotely, covering living expenses, and giving paid time off if you are unable to work remotely.
Personal Travel
If you are planning any personal travel please let a member of the PeopleOps team know. Any staff member planning to visit a Level 1 or 2 area will be asked to work from home for 14 days post-return. Anyone visiting a Level 3 area will be asked to be diligent about avoiding sick people and washing their hands, and to closely monitor their health upon return. Please note that if you travel for personal reasons and are unable to return home/to work the company will do its best to accomodate you working remotely but will not be able to cover any costs or time off beyond your accrued vacation days.
Guests
We will be asking any guests coming into the office if they have traveled to a Level 1 or 2 area in the past month, or come into contact with anyone who has. If they have, we will shift the meeting to be conducted remotely.
If you have a guest coming to the office that is not being handled through PeopleOps or Leadership, please make sure to follow the above guidelines.
Preparing To Be Fully Distributed
The CDC has advised businesses to make a plan in case it is necessary for all employees to work from home. PeopleOps and the Leadership team are currently making preparations for this and we will update everyone as makes sense. We’re doing this not because we expect it to be necessary, but because we want to be ready and have a seamless transition if needed.
As part of our planning we may come speak with some of you to find out what tools you need to do your work. If you have any thoughts please let a member of PeopleOps know so we can include them in our plans.

Your health and safety is most important to us. We’ll continue to monitor the situation and send out additional guidance as needed. If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to anyone on the Leadership or PeopleOps teams.
This is an ongoing and developing situation and no one knows all the answers. We are hearing many questions about the legality of mandatory screening, or requirements for temporary remote work, if it’s ok to ask employees to conduct business travel, and how to manage reductions in pay for hourly staff. We strongly recommend discussing the specifics of your company’s challenges with your employment counsel, as the right answers will vary in different locations, businesses and situations.
We hope this template is helpful to you. We know everything is moving quickly so we advise everyone to stay informed, stay flexible, and stay empathetic. Aside from the general news, there’s also a lot of crowdsourced information available about what different companies are doing as a response, which may be helpful."
84,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2020/3/25/wfh-support-your-remote-managers-and-caregivers,"With the news that schools may be closed for the rest of the year, we know that parents and caregivers are feeling anxious and unsure how they’ll balance their professional and personal responsibilities. At the same time, many company leaders and HR teams are wondering how they can best support their employees who need flexibility while keeping projects generally on track.
This is not a typical work-from-home situation where caretakers can make proactive adjustments to ensure coverage during work hours, as many resources are not available or closed. Approach the situation with empathy and put yourself in your employee’s shoes to understand their anxiety and their limited options. You will need to be creative and flexible to support parents working from home with their children or employees needing to check in on or help high-risk family members.
We’ve gathered our top tips for HR, company leadership, and managers as they think about how to set and share expectations during these uncertain times.
Encourage a conversation with managers
Let your employees know that you understand that this is not a typical situation and you want to help ensure they have flexibility to handle their other responsibilities during work hours. Encourage them to continuously communicate with their managers about what their situation looks like throughout this time period. We suggest that caregivers create transparent calendar blocks/Slack away messages so team members are aware of their accessibility ie. 1 hour block for “3rd Grade Math” or 30 min for “Putting the baby down for a nap.” Aside from transparency, this allows managers to understand their team’s schedule and adjust deadlines, make better plans as to who should work together, and plan team meetings for when everyone is available. It also allows managers to be clear with impacted staff members what work they should prioritize during their potentially limited work hours.
Set shared expectations
Set the tone that all staff members should be understanding of the difficult situation caregivers are in. Leadership and managers should explicitly state their support of impacted employees and note that while you want to get as much done as possible you know it’s not “business as usual” right now. Acknowledge the difficulty and stress your employees may be facing, and normalize the fact that there might be a child interrupting or partner on the phone in the same room (Mute button for the win on Zoom and Hangouts!).
Create a Slack channel or email group for parents and caregivers
Create a forum where impacted employees can exchange information on what's working for them, share resources, and support each other. You want your employees to be able to lean on each other during hard times so create as many forums for this as possible. Also ask them what they want - they probably have the best ideas of what would be useful.
Allow for shift work or flexible hours when possible
It’s just not realistic to think that caregivers are going to be able to work completely normal hours. Instead leaders should focus on setting up schedules that allow impacted employees to focus, as that’s the key to productivity and getting good work done. Alternate schedules can include: early morning starts that end in the afternoon, splitting the day between early morning and then again after bedtime, doing block scheduling where they alternate full or half work days with their partner (if this is possible), and changing their work week to include weekends as a swap for certain weekdays.
Many caregivers simply do not have good options right now so as an employer you should try to be as flexible as you can. Frequently evaluate priorities and adjust timelines to fit the capacity of your team. Be realistic about what impacted caregivers can get done - even if someone can work 40 hours while caring for someone else, they’ll likely burn out quickly. If you are a company that cares more about what gets done than what hours are worked, it’s to your benefit to be flexible wherever you can be. If you proactively help certain staff members reduce their hours or switch their schedule around you’re more likely to get the most from them. It’s also a great opportunity to look to other team members who may have fewer responsibilities and are looking to take on something new or really flex in a developmental area.

The situation surrounding COVID-19 is developing and changing quickly; we advise everyone to stay informed, stay flexible and stay empathetic.

85,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2020/4/22/the-practices-well-keep,"We spent time at a recent remote all-hands meeting, talking about what we called Gray Linings. We asked each employee to talk about the unexpected positives that have come out of remote working here at Gray Scalable. We surprised ourselves in what ended up becoming an uplifting and emotional meeting - we talked about personal and professional positives, and left the meeting feeling better than we did coming into it.
These are trying times. In our efforts to find the positive, it’s really possible to teeter into not honoring how we’re feeling, by waving things away, saying “it could be worse!” or “at least you have…”, “at least you’re not…” That said, I am a chronic optimist, and believe strongly that some good has to come out of this world-altering stuff going on around us. I’ve seen some very positive outcomes as we have been working remotely, and really hope some of these practices are here to stay. Here’s my wish-list, anyway:
Connecting on a Personal Level
I currently work in an industry that welcomes and embraces getting to know people on a personal level, but started my career in an industry that emphasized separating personal and professional lives. As much as I do connect closely with my Gray Scalable colleagues, I was still maintaining my deeply-ingrained professional-distance habits when talking to clients and when conducting interviews. This crisis has changed that for me personally - in a positive way. Every meeting and interview now starts with a personal check-in. I’ve gotten to meet clients’ school-aged kiddos on Zooms, and have joked with candidates about inevitable mishaps on video interviews (it happens! Read more about how to interview with empathy, here). It feels like our interactions are, in general, more empathetic, and more connected. I hope we get to keep that.
Work/Life Integration
Remember when it was a huge deal when that reporter from the BBC got interrupted on a live broadcast by his toddler? He has nothing on Pandemic Parents working (and homeschooling?!) from home. Now, not only are babies across America sitting in on meetings, but we’re welcoming our kids, parents, and fur-babies to join our video calls. It’s truly a highlight of my day, when we have our team daily standup, and we get some hilarious commentary from Katie’s kindergartener and 3YO (I even got busted for using bad language, when I called something “stupid” - touché, cutie). While everyone at our company enjoys flexibility (regardless of family status), I know I’ve put pressure on myself to wall off family impact on my work life. It’s an impossible goal, to strive to have the personal have zero impact on the professional. Even after this crisis passes, we’ll need to block time to work on homework, or take the dog to the vet, or to look after an aging parent. On the other side of this crisis, let’s not forget that we were able to get great work done, while also looking after our loved ones.
Practicing Self-Care
This pandemic has opened up the conversation about mental health and the very real need to practice self-care on a daily basis. We’ve encouraged our employees to block time for a daily walk, or meditation, or whatever it is that’s needed, to engage in some form of self-care. We’re hosting impromptu Happy Hours, that easily go an hour or more, with cocktails or without. I’m seeing my counterparts in HR across the startup space doing the same, and it’s a much-needed, timely trend. We’re acknowledging that we need to take care of ourselves and each other - and we should keep doing that. We’ll need to do it anyway, as we start on our journey back to work as we knew it.
While I’m pining for the days when I can see my work colleagues in person again, I know the return will be gradual. I hope we can carry these things with us, when we work our way back to NYC.
What’s making your work life better? What would you like to see continue on, post-pandemic?
written by Deb Feldman"
86,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2020/4/27/return-to-work-consider-your-employees,"When the pandemic struck, it seemed like business changed overnight – in ways that were unprecedented. Regardless of a company’s size, type, or industry, it is clear that none of us really felt prepared for the sweeping changes that COVID-19 would bring.
Now that more communities are considering easing restrictions on COVID-19-related quarantine, businesses must think about resuming operations as well. The good news is that in many instances, companies will have time to prepare for a return to work – something that wasn’t really an option for us when the quarantine began.
One of the first considerations is your employees. What can you, as an employer, do to help employees through the transition, and make it as easy, productive and seamless as possible. Just remember: there is no clear end date to the current situation – companies must take a phased approach in the Return to Work (RTW) plan, and be sure to be as flexible as possible.
Some things to think about when building a RTW plan include:
Employee preferences will be different
Some employees may not want to return to work right away, even when it is possible to do so. They may be balancing responsibilities outside of work, working outside the commutable area, or simply prefer remote work for the time being. Other employees may be eager to return to a regular work setting, and get back to normal as quickly as possible.
Plan ahead for how you will address each of these situations. Creating a policy that is flexible enough to accommodate employee needs where possible. Be sure that in any situation where the decision is not to accommodate the employee’s preference, that a valid, logical business reason for the decision is identified and communicated.
Your office practices may need to change
Some office design choices, like open layouts or common eating areas, were made in a different time. Review your layout critically, and evaluate whether it will be possible to maintain the required social distancing in the office. Consider:
- Rearranging desks, to put more space between employees working
- Reducing conference room capacity
- Improving cleaning in shared areas like kitchens and bathrooms
Think of the possibility of changing normal hours of operation, so that employees aren’t forced into using public transportation in large crowds during rush hour. Another option might be to implement shifts or rotate work from home days so that all employees aren’t on site at the same time.
The idea is to provide for the health and safety of employees, but also to consider their comfort. Different people will have different concerns, and their needs may change over time as well. Again, the best thing an employer can do in these circumstances is to be flexible and make accommodations where possible.

87,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2020/4/30/return-to-work-are-new-policies-necessary,"As COVID-19 restrictions are eased, businesses must begin to think about resuming operations and getting back to work. However, what will a return to work look like? It’s likely that there will be some lasting changes as a result of the upheaval of the past few months. Think about whether your existing policies and procedures are still applicable, or if they should be updated to reflect the new state of work.
Some policies that may be affected are:
PTO
Does your company currently have restrictions on how many people can take PTO at once? Make sure that requests for time off can be accommodated, while still ensuring that the business has enough coverage to maintain operations.
Does your company have a ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ policy, with restrictions on the number of hours that can be carried over from year to year? Considering everything that has happened already in 2020, perhaps those restrictions can be eased temporarily.
Work from Home
As many businesses have required employees to work from home, we’ve all learned a few things: about the tools, practices, and accommodations that support successful remote work. Employers may also have a new perspective about which jobs (and which employees) are suited to remote work.
In light of what you’ve learned, review work from home policies and see if they can be revised to support flexibility and agility in operations, while accommodating employee needs.
Performance
Keeping employees informed and providing feedback is important during a disruption, as communication is critical to building trust. However, expectations may need to be adjusted. Perhaps in the current environment, it’s not realistic to expect a salesperson to meet unchanged targets or a customer service representative to get high customer satisfaction ratings.
Rethink your expectations in the light of what can realistically be achieved today, and be flexible about targets, goals and objectives. Work with HR, managers and employees to realign and implement new performance expectations.

88,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2020/5/6/return-to-work-logistics,"As more communities are easing restrictions and people are resuming regular activities, businesses are starting to think about returning to work. When COVID-19 hit, it was a sudden and unprecedented change – and most companies instantly went to crisis mode. Now, with another change on the horizon, the good news is that we have time to take a deep breath and consider what a return to work will look like.
Work Hours
Think about what ‘normal working hours’ meant before the crisis, and what that means now. Just because everyone used to work together from 9-5 doesn’t mean this is the best solution. If you are concerned about having too many people on site at the same time, think about having different shifts, or rotating work from home days throughout the week. If your employees are uncomfortable with public transportation during rush hour, consider flexible hours that would move the commute to a less-difficult time.
PPE
Under RTW regulations, your employees may be required to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks and gloves while working. However, even if it is not required, many people have grown accustomed to using PPE as they go about their lives, and may prefer to use them when they return to work.
As an employer, providing sufficient PPE to accommodate employees that are required to use it, as well as those that want to use it, is a good way to show that you are considerate, and are prioritizing the health and safety of your employees.
Visitors
Many offices had a fairly open policy regarding visitors, welcoming guests even if the business reason for it wasn’t totally clear. Post-COVID, it may make more sense to limit the number of visitors that will be allowed on site, allowing only those visits that are necessary while completing other meetings over phone or video call.
Task Force
Return to work will not be a ‘set it and forget it’ solution. Over time, employer responses should be monitored, measured, and optimized. Consider assigning a task force to keep an eye on the RTW process, and set regular task force meetings to gather information, impressions, and make any changes to optimize the work environment for your employees.

89,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2020/6/17/what-happens-to-pay-when-employees-move,"Recently, Facebook announced that employee pay would not change for the remainder of 2020, but they would adjust the pay of employees who move to lower-cost locations as of 2021.
The reaction on social media was fiery; how could you cut pay for employees? While I can empathize with the initial outrage that a company that already makes tens of billions further profiting because of reduced payroll costs, this is actually the right thing to do from a fairness perspective. Facebook does some controversial things; this is not one of them.
Let me explain.
The pay rates offered at any given company are usually set up by compensation and total rewards experts who have access to large, standardized market surveys of compensation data, similar to how a finance or marketing team might subscribe to a data platform that provides them with competitive insights and benchmarks.
Once a company sets its target pay, a standard practice if you have employees in other locations is to determine the percentage difference in pay rates associated with those locations and apply those to your salary ranges. Again, this is often determined by those same compensation experts using data from compensation survey providers.
To demonstrate this - if you’re a software engineer in Atlanta, and move to the Bay Area, you’d likely be getting a significant pay increase. This seems intuitive and fair, to make more money in a location where the cost of living is dramatically higher. Then, consider the converse: if you’re a software engineer in the Bay Area and moving to a lower-cost location, your pay would decrease. If the move was to a location like Chicago, Denver or DC, this may mean pay is 10% less. If you move to Minneapolis, it might be 15% less. The most important thing to note here is that the decrease in salary is related to cost of living, but the difference in pay is actually (and often) smaller than the difference in cost of living. In other words, if you relocate from San Francisco to Minneapolis, the cost of living might be 30% less but the pay differential might be half that. So while the decrease in pay is a cost savings for employers, the benefit to individual employees is often even greater, especially in locations with lower income and property taxes.
In addition, the rise in remote tech work in the past few years has already had an impact on pay. The difference in pay for certain cities relative to premium markets like San Francisco have actually been decreasing over the past couple of years. Three years ago, the difference in pay for an engineer in Denver may have been 15% less than in San Francisco; now it’s closer to 10%. It remains to be seen what the movement of employees as a result of COVID-19 will do to market pay rates, but they will likely remain competitive and outpace the difference in cost of living.
All that said, I want to re-emphasize how much the cost of labor in a given location is already part of market pay structure. At large companies there are often a combination of real estate, facilities, finance and/or workforce planning teams that are balancing where to hire employees based on the availability of talent in a given location, the markets into which they want to expand and the cost of doing so. There is a reason that over 50% of Facebook’s current open job postings in North America are outside the Bay Area; a combination of where the talent is located, where it needs to be, and the cost. This is a deliberate, carefully studied and common best practice for large or growing organizations - to take total cost of employment into consideration, and to hire deliberately outside of their most expensive markets.
Even with data, this still may feel unfair or wrong to individuals considering a move outside of cities with high cost of living. It's understandable - nobody wants to take a pay cut. Here are some more things to consider, while thinking about the fairness-factor:
Consider the view of the employees already in another market; if an employee is paid market rates for San Francisco, which are the highest in the country, and that employee moves to Minneapolis, is it fair that they are paid 15%+ more than peers in that location for the same role?
At a macroeconomic level for a company the size of Facebook, which has tens of thousands of employees, what happens when a significant portion moves to a smaller city with unadjusted pay? What is the impact on the local economy, affordable housing, and other economic impacts we’ve seen arise when high-paying, large tech companies expand?
A note that this post is geared toward large organizations whose employees are making, on average, 2x to 5x+ the national median salaries. The practices described here are often adopted by smaller companies as well, but may be modified (eg, allowing employees to keep their pay rate after they move but not getting increases for a few years, or allowing a few one-off employees to not change their pay).
The compensation analysts at Facebook and similar companies, who are fluent with market pay in all geographies, are doing their jobs. By ensuring fair market pay according to location, they are able to be more equitable to employees and to the cities in which they employ people.
If your company is facing challenges in structuring compensation, or looking to align your pay practices to be competitive with the market, it's something our team is knowledgeable and passionate about. You can find out more information here."
90,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/2020/8/26/how-to-build-a-fair-and-effective-technical-interview-test,"A really good technical interview - one that evaluates skills accurately, and gets the best results - usually includes a test. But the truth is, not all tests are created fairly. As you start to build the interview process for your next tech role, there are a few things you need to think about in order to create an equitable, relevant test.
Relevance
First, while all roles can and should be tested, it’s crucial that the test you’re planning actually helps determine the candidate’s grasp of the skills needed for the job you’re hiring for. And that ALL of your potential candidates are able to properly exhibit those skills with the test you’re planning. Different roles will require different tests, some more detailed or advanced than others, and some that are pretty simple - even a standardized test, when designed well, should provide important insight into the candidate’s understanding of important concepts and skill level.
At its core, a good technical test is designed to determine if your candidate has the necessary technical skills to succeed in the role you’re hiring for. The tricky part can be separating what is required versus what’s nice to have in an ideal candidate.
As you plan the test, and the interview process all together, it’s important to remember that not everyone has had access to the same schooling, classes or opportunities - and it’s not a good use of anyone's time to test for skills that the candidate won’t actually use in the job. For example, there are a lot of companies that ask computer science fundamental questions, which if you don't have a CS degree can be really tough. While compsci fundamentals are required for some roles, companies who test for them when the job doesn’t actually require them will eliminate candidates who come to the table from different educational backgrounds. We see a lot of self taught programmers and bootcamp grads facing this problem, even though there are times when their practical experience may be more relevant to the position than what someone learned in a more formal, undergraduate program.
Once you’ve determined what’s required in an ideal candidate for this role, you’ll need to decide how you’re going to test for that in your interview process. You can start by looking at the skills needed for this role - if you’re hiring a Front End Engineer, you may be looking for javascript experience, meanwhile, if you’re hiring for a Data Engineer, you may be looking for ETL pipeline development skills. Though they’re both technical roles, they each require pretty different skill sets. This reminds me of one of my favorite quotes:
“Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.”
Similarly, if you test a Site Reliability Engineer on their ability to write production-level Javascript, they not only won’t be able to show you how qualified they are to be a Site Reliability Engineer - they may elect out of your interview process all together. Unemployment in the tech industry (prior to COVID-19) was at an all-time low, and still, in the tech industry, candidates often have the luxury of choice when it comes to their next career move. When you send a test to a candidate that is neither relevant to their skills nor to the job they are applying for, it's a negative experience for them, and makes it easy for candidates to decide they'd rather pursue the other ten opportunities that recruiters have recently emailed them about. Candidate experience in the interview process is hugely important, and a bad test is a bad experience. So create a test that’s right for the role you’re hiring for - one that allows your candidates to exhibit the actual skills they need to perform the job.
Once you’ve determined the specific skills you’re looking for and how you’re going to test for them, there are a few more factors to consider: the testing platform, the required tools and tech, the length and timeline, and accessibility.
The testing platform.
You want to choose a platform that’s free to the candidates, easy to use, and reliable. The last thing you want is to lose a great candidate because your testing platform was hard to access, difficult to understand, or unreliable - both in terms of connectivity and the ability to save one’s work. Some testing platforms we have successfully used in the past include: Codility, Coderpad, and True Ability. Additionally, there are a few free platforms we often recommend to smaller clients: codesandbox and codeshare.io. And finally, for companies that don't want to invest the time or money into some of those more advanced platforms, a well-written assignment with submission guidelines on GitHub is always a great option!
The length and timeline.
Another crucial element of a technical test is the length, and with that, the timeline that you’re providing to candidates to complete the test. When you’re creating the test for your role, it's important to be aware that not all candidates have the same availability. Candidates with responsibilities beyond their day jobs (childcare, elder care, etc. which often fall to women) may not have the same amount of free time as other candidates in the pipeline. So be thoughtful as you’re planning the test, take into consideration how long the test might take and be generous with your timeline. We often prefer to send the test to candidates and ask them to set a due date for themselves once they have scoped out the work - that way they can plan to work on the assignment around their schedule, and we have a set due date to hold them accountable to.
The required tools and tech.
You need to know the exact tools and tech required for your candidates to properly perform the test, and you need to be up front with candidates about what they will need. A test cannot successfully gauge a candidate’s skills and abilities if they don’t have the correct tools and technology to complete the assignment. In order to create a truly equitable and inclusive testing process, you need to ensure that everyone can take the test and that candidates aren’t electing out because they don’t have access to the required tools, or were blindsided by the need to obtain those tools themselves rather than having the hiring company provide them.
Accessibility.
This brings us to the accessibility of your test - are you offering solutions to candidates who don’t own the required tools and tech? If you’re requiring things like screen sharing, what do you do if a candidate is concerned about how that may violate their privacy? You don’t need to have solutions to every single possible scenario ahead of time, but you do need to be willing to work with your candidates who make it to the testing stage, and be willing to create fair solutions to accommodate them. Ultimately, it’s on the company and the interviewing team to properly prepare candidates for the test and the overall interview process.
Don’t lose a candidate because they couldn't even take the test - create a strong, accessible test in order to make educated decisions based on the skills your candidates demonstrated during the testing process. Additionally, it’s crucial that you don't pre-judge candidates, who opt not to take your test, as uninterested or unqualified - the fact is, there are always other opportunities and they may be considering several other companies with easier, or more relevant, testing options.
Creating an excellent technical interviewing process that gets results isn’t an easy thing to do: particularly when incorporating a test to help evaluate a candidate’s skills and abilities. But if you put some strategic thinking behind test design, and flexibility and accommodation to test delivery, a technical interview test can actually improve the candidate experience, remove one of the many barriers to building a truly diverse team, and help you get the best results as you build a strong technical team for your company.

91,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/6-simple-but-powerful-steps-to-becoming-a-more-inclusive-leader,"Gray Scalable recently hosted a panel discussion on,”Bringing yourself to work when your ‘self’ is different.” We brought together a group of thought leaders - Brianna Holt, Dara Williams, Oscar Diaz and Yvonne Dodd - and the panel was moderated by our head of Tech Recruiting, Nissa Booker, who led everyone through a powerful discussion of personal stories on navigating less-than-inclusive spaces and tricky office politics, as well as strategies to create environments where everyone can truly thrive while being themselves. Read below for some key takeaways from the conversation - you can also watch the full recording here.
A diverse workplace is only the first step - to be truly inclusive and successful, companies need to build and cultivate environments where everyone has the tools, resources and help to be comfortable, supported, and able to do their best work. Here are some tips to help you support and encourage employees who feel like the odd person out at your organization.
Be proactive. Dedicate time to learn as a leader, to research and read - take advantage of existing webinars and online resources. We don’t always have to recreate the wheel, there are tons of strategies and methods that have been tried and tested by others; use their experience and knowledge to your advantage. If you have the budget, don’t shy away from looking for external help to supplement your knowledge. Invest in DEI coaches that will help you and your managers grow. Make sure to look for coaches that will push you to develop the muscle of thinking in a different way and challenge your norms.
Lead by example. So much of the everyday culture and environment at an organization relies on leaders setting a strong example. Yes, everyone should be free to be themselves, but that often means something different to each person - be mindful that not everyone wants to share every part of themselves in the workplace, and create space for that. As a leader, it’s important to allow your employees to determine what their boundaries are for sharing, and to support those boundaries - not just in your 1:1s, but in every interaction individuals have within the company. Raise this topic in team meetings, as it’s up to you to set the tone for what bringing yourself to work means. Remember that the goal is connection and being compassionate, rather than knowing every detail of people’s personal lives.
Get to know your team. You have to authentically build relationships with the individuals on your team, especially when you have new employees. It’s crucial to make yourself available and show that you want to get to know them - have a virtual lunch or breakfast, set up regular 1:1’s (more frequently as they’re getting started and then in a regular cadence once they’ve settled in).
In your early meetings, make a concerted effort to get to know what your team members are about as people, learn about what their triggers are and what motivates them. As time goes on and your employees settle in, make sure your 1:1’s aren’t all business - allow for time for the two of you to connect. For some of your quieter employees who may not feel comfortable speaking out in larger group settings, this is their time to talk to you.
Be an advocate. The role of people leaders is to be brave. Pick your battles, and advocate for people: call out when your employees do good work; lift up and acknowledge the behind-the-scenes quality work, not just the obviously visible high-performers; bring attention to people who said something great and weren’t acknowledged for their idea. This type of consistent advocacy will help your team get noticed by others in the company and on the leadership team and help set them up for potential future projects and promotions.
Acknowledgement is key. Acknowledgement doesn't just mean a pat on the back for the work your team is doing, or calling attention to things strictly inside of your organization's bubble. It’s equally important that you acknowledge what people are going through outside of work, in their different communities, and in society around them. Create safe spaces for people to discuss the things that are happening in the world. Acknowledge that people may need a mental health day and proactively offer it to them. We have expectations of productivity that aren’t tied to realistic outputs - we’re in a global pandemic and a time of social upheaval; mental health is affected, and our capacity for output is affected.
Ask for feedback and hold yourself accountable. Challenge your team to hold you accountable. If you are a leader from an underrepresented group, make yourself available to other folks across the company even if they’re not in your direct reporting structure. Share your privilege by giving them access to you as an ear and a shoulder to lean on. Don’t be scared to say or do the wrong thing, and as a result wind up doing nothing instead. Be ok making mistakes or having tough conversations.

We hope every interview results in a perfect fit – but we also know that some of them won’t. Here’s part two of a two-part guide for both candidates and clients to brush up on The Art of Rejection. You can find part one, The Art of Rejection - For Companies, here.
---
Just because I’m a recruiter, doesn’t mean I haven’t been on the other end of the rejection conversation. I’ve left interviews pumped up and sure I had it in the bag, only to hear the thunderous sound of silence that followed. Here’s how to handle rejection gracefully:
Follow Up
Having done a lot of high-volume recruiting, I actually really appreciate it when a candidate follows up with me – even if I’m going to reject them for that job, I’m more likely to consider that person again the next time around if their follow up is that right mix of persistent, but not too persistent.
Reject Them Well Too
It’s not just the company interviewing that’s doing the potential rejecting here. Remember, as a candidate, you are interviewing the company as a prospective employer as much as they are interviewing you as a possible employee. So, if the match just isn’t there for you, make sure to handle that with as much sensitivity as you’d hope they would with you. Accepting a competing offer is the easiest way to bow out of the process. But if you haven’t landed yet, it’s still important that you close the loop right. They’ll respect that you’re not just looking for any old job – and will respect your honesty if you let them know the objective reasons you don’t want to pursue the job anymore. That leads to the next point….
Stay Classy
Remember that this is a very, very small world. Social media sites like LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter have connected us globally and have made it even smaller. Your reputation will follow you, so the way you react to rejection will too.
Take the Hint
Sometimes, companies are just plain bad at closing the loop. Or, sometimes, they string candidates along forever because they can’t deliver a tough message (think about Milton from Office Space never quite getting fired). Maybe they’ve intentionally gone dark – or maybe they just got too busy. Either way, if a hiring manager or recruiter has stopped replying to your follow-up emails or calls – it’s probably time to move on.
Don’t Take to the Airwaves
Even if you don’t like the outcome – or the way the company managed the message to you – it’s best to keep your feedback about that off of social media. You won’t change the outcome, and you run the risk of damaging your own reputation.
Remember that candidates and companies alike struggle with rejecting. Best thing to do is not to take it personally, to learn from whatever feedback you do receive, and to use that information to shape what it is you’re really looking for in the next career move."
94,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/build-the-ultimate-interview-process-using-chatgpt,"A.I. can serve as a useful tool to structure interviews, save time and accelerate the partnership between hiring managers and recruiters.
A key part of a great hiring manager and recruiter partnership is getting organized around the hiring process. When recruiters step into intake meetings with hiring managers holding a developed interview process, those hiring managers will in turn head into interviews more prepared. The result is a more human candidate experience, better assessment, and, ultimately, more successful hires!
As a leading provider of embedded recruiting services and executive search, Gray Scalable understands the importance of building a structured and effective interview process for startups and growth-stage companies. Our recruitment consulting team is always evaluating the latest tools, technologies, and tactics to optimize the hiring process, allowing us to spend more partnership time with our client hiring managers.
With ChatGPT, we have achieved significant efficiencies that will allow you to devote more time to the crucial aspects of hiring for your position that require the most attention.
As early adopters and current superfans, we can confidently say this technology is nothing short of magical for getting an effective interview process off the ground. So magical that we don’t want to keep it all to ourselves. Here are some of our favorite tips on using ChatGPT to efficiently create a best-in-class interview process.
Tailor Your ChatGPT Experience to Fit Your Company’s Unique Hiring Needs
A quick word of caution before we dive in: These tips will give you instant and impressive results. It’s critical to tailor the results to fit the unique needs of each job, department, company, and hiring team.
We already highlighted how important partnership is — this is where it comes in. If you are a recruiter, we highly recommend partnering with your hiring manager or executive team, especially when selecting key core competencies.
it is important to be aware of potential biases and ensure they are not present in any aspect of the interview process, whether the input is from a human or Artificial Intelligence. This is crucial to ensure fairness and equity in the selection process.
With that, off we go — here are 6 ways ChatGPT can help recruiters and hiring managers to build a great interview process:
- Identify Core Competencies
Focusing on the right skills can play a pivotal role in an effective interview process. ChatGPT easily generates a comprehensive skill list for you. Keep in mind that ChatGPT can sometimes provide more verbose responses than needed, so make sure to ask it to return short answers for the best results:
- Create Hiring Rubric
ChatGPT’s Rubric capabilities lay out foundational guidance to help interviewers more easily map candidates by level using the competencies. This is where the “chat” part of ChatGPT is amazing — the tool will remember the competencies from the first question, so just ask it to reference them! Again this is a great start, so we recommend dropping this in a shared doc and ensuring the interview team puts a healthy amount of time into making this their own:
Other ChatGPT Functions and Capabilities
Beyond establishing competencies and developing a Rubric, ChatGPT offers a wide range of other valuable capabilities. Users can:
- Build a library of interview questions
- Generate a feedback form
- Create an interview plan template for interviewers
- Improve the overall candidate experience by creating a guide

95,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/embracing-disabilities-in-the-workplace,"Embracing Disabilities in the Workplace
By: Gray Scalable
As recruiters and HR professionals, we believe that when discussing diversifying our teams or creating an inclusive work environment, it's crucial that disability not be left out of the conversation. One in four adults in the United States has a learning or thinking difference,* and many don’t disclose their disability status for fear of discrimination or poor treatment. If you have a goal to diversify your team and create an environment where everyone can do their best work, you should be proactive about opening up the conversation around disability inclusion.
Get started with these tips from a recent panel we hosted with Understood, a non-profit dedicated to serving the millions of people who learn and think differently. Watch the full recording here.
Educate yourself on what invisible and visible disabilities are.
When we talk about visible disabilities, we mean disabilities you can see - individuals with a physical impairment of some sort. While visible disabilities can be noticed when looking at a person, developmental, or invisible, disabilities are not always easy to notice, as sometimes they are not apparent or obvious to the naked eye. When we talk about learning and thinking differences (invisible disabilities) we mean everything on the spectrum from ADHD to Autism to other neurodiverse mental challenges, or simply people who learn and process differently regardless of the diagnosis attached to it. These can also include things we might not typically associate as disabilities such as diabetes, epilepsy, generalized anxiety disorder, and more.
Make sure you’re up to date on how the ADA factors into the conversation.
The ADA, or the Americans with Disabilities Act, passed in 1990, is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on disability. This law made it illegal to not hire people because of their diagnosed disability, or your perception of their disability. The ADA changed the workplace, by not only giving employers the framework to provide reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities, but also by providing employees and job seekers the tools and pathways to seek employment, and/or to seek redress if they found themselves out of employment because of a disability.
Understand what we mean by “reasonable accommodations.”
This can get a little tricky, because everyone’s definition of reasonable is different. However, as an employer, it’s up to you to cultivate a work environment where your employees feel safe and encouraged, so that they are able to grow and succeed (which in turn benefits the organization as much as the employee). This may require an individualized approach - you can start by ensuring your employees have the resources and space to comfortably ask for any accommodations they might need. You can also proactively encourage all of your employees, but especially your HR team and managers, to be thoughtful as they approach disability conversations with these disability etiquette tips from the team at Understood.
If you have specific questions about the ADA or job accommodations at your workplace speak with an employment lawyer and check out a favorite resource of ours: askjan.org.
Be thoughtful about disability from the start.
Show potential employees that you’re an organization that encourages accommodations by offering them at the interview stage. Ask candidates right off the bat, before you’ve even met them, before the interview process has truly started, “do you need any accommodation?” - and then you can continue to offer again at every phase of the process. Designate a point person for the candidate to come to should they need accommodations or want to disclose, and encourage them to get in touch if they need anything along the way.
Make it clear you’re proactively thinking about accommodations.
Regularly check in with your team - ask how they’re doing, see if they feel like they have everything they need to be successful at work. Start by getting to know your employees - this can be at the top level, Founders and CEOs getting to know their teams and making themselves approachable; this can be at the manager level, in 1:1s or small team meetings, letting your employees know that you welcome conversation and encourage them to ask questions when it comes to health benefits, disability-inclusion, accommodations, and more.
It’s ok if you don’t have all of the answers. When your employees feel comfortable and safe disclosing to you, that’s the first step. From there, you can work together to find the tools and resources they need.
Meet people where they are.
Don’t force someone to talk about or come forward with a disability (or in general, something they aren’t comfortable with and will never disclose); and don’t assume any of your employees need accommodations. Instead, you can try relating to them or sharing your own personal experiences. Even if you don’t have experience with a disability, you can share ways you make accommodations to make your own work life better (i.e switching to phone calls for a while to avoid Zoom Fatigue, taking a mental health day to rest and recharge, etc).
Once your employees are comfortable and you’ve created an open dialogue, you’ll find that you’re not only better able to support them as an individual, but you’re also on your way to creating an environment that’s equitable for everyone."
96,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/keep-your-employees-engaged,"Keep Your Employees Engaged in a Hybrid Culture
By: Gray Scalable
These days, the narrative has shifted in a positive way to focus on employees being the real drivers of company progress - we can all agree that engaged, happy employees are crucial to the success of any business. Whether you’ve spent the last few years working at home, in a hybrid environment, or back in the office, it’s up to managers and company leaders to find creative ways for all of their employees to feel engaged and included in their work environments. In today’s world this isn’t always easy - you’re navigating COVID guidelines and employee safety, questions about flexibility at work, employee burnout, and so much more. Here are some programs and channels that foster connections and can help keep your employees engaged in a safe way.
Meetings don’t have to be all business
Set aside a budget for agenda-free, company-paid outdoor walks or coffee chats - offer it to employees, but don’t mandate it.
Make downtime in and out of the office for employees to socialize informally and encourage people to use it. Have your company leadership role model that it’s OK to chat over a coffee and get to know each other - or take a slightly longer lunch away from your desk in a group setting.
On the other hand, don’t force connections - some people will not want to socialize in a planned way or in a group setting, and you shouldn’t pressure them to. Make space for alternate ways for employees to engage with each other in ways that work for them.
As an alternative, you can encourage volunteerism, start some non-work-topic Slack channels, or otherwise create space for employees to connect in a less socially pressurized way.
Tools and resources are your friend
Give your employees the tools to communicate more effectively with each other. These can be actual tools like Slack for easy communication, or mmhmm to help spice up your virtual meetings.
It can also be helpful to provide access to team building exercises, like a DiSC assessment to help people understand their own communication styles and those of the people around them.
Think about casual mentorship programs, or ERGs
Where possible, create working partnerships or pairs so that employees have the opportunity to work closely with each other (remote or in person) and develop connections that way.
Mentorships, especially across teams and levels, not only create educational and professional development opportunities, they can also create opportunities for cross team collaboration, help employees advance in their careers, and help foster a more welcoming and collaborative company culture.
A frequently underutilized resource in companies of all sizes is an ERG (Employee Resource Group). ERGs are often formed internally (in partnership with HR) by employees who share a common characteristic – ethnicity, gender, family status, etc. At face value, ERGs are a great way for employees to connect with their colleagues who share similar experiences and provide support to each other. They can also have a real impact on company culture.
--
This is by no means an exhaustive list - don’t be afraid to ask your employees what they want and know you don’t need to do this alone or do everything all at once. Your employees will tell you what they want, need, or expect from you, especially as things continue to shift in the new year. Cultivate a company culture where your employees have opportunities to talk comfortably with you, and be honest with them about what is and is not feasible.
Once you’ve created this environment, ensure you can maintain it as you grow and make changes to your work environment - if you’re thinking about returning to the office in 2022, check out these tips to help you strengthen your culture along the way."
97,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/live-from-new-york-salary-ranges,"Live from New York: Salary Ranges!
By: Sam Feldman
Everyone has lots of questions, and a fair amount of anxiety about the new salary transparency law in NYC. Should you be worried? Depends on the kind of company you are. Many (maybe even most) companies sincerely want to pay their people fairly and consistently, relative to the job market and to their other employees - because this is better for the long term health and longevity of their business, increasing retention, engagement and quality of work. However, there are many companies who make pay decisions on an individual basis, as needed, without any overall structure or concern for pay equity and fairness. If you’re one of these, you probably should be worried. But if you do aspire to be fair, consistent and market-competitive, then this is a healthy step forward, and can be managed effectively to help ensure safe growth for your business long term.
It’s understandable to be anxious about this change, however - the short term risks and complications are real, and it’s important to do some planning to get yourself and your company in front of this. This advice is meant to help you do that.
Written by:
The pillars of a strong compensation program are
Consistency, Competitiveness and Communication.
Internal Consistency:
Get Your Ducks in a Row
The first thing to do is take a look at your employee data - are people paid fairly relative to one another?
Even if your company has a full total rewards team or has purchased a large amount of compensation data, we at Gray Scalable would argue that reviewing and comparing current employees is the most critical thing to do. Having internal consistency, intentionality and fairness in compensation decisions has the greatest impact on employees’ feeling of being paid fairly for their work, and will make the roll-out of salary ranges a lot smoother.
The main questions to ask yourself when doing this review: for similar job functions and levels, are employees paid within a healthy range of one another? Are the differences between employees justifiable (performance, experience, recent promotions, etc.)? The litmus test for this is what we call our first principle of compensation: if someone accidentally publicly shared all of your employee salary information, would you feel that you could comfortably defend all decisions that have been made? This should be your first round of any compensation corrections.
If you don’t already have market-backed salary ranges, the salary ranges you create for job descriptions should align with how you are paying people in the same/similar jobs internally. And if the salary ranges you are publishing on job descriptions are significantly higher, you should make market corrections to employees before you go live with them. Yes, this will have an immediate and ongoing payroll cost, but replacing people who are upset at being underpaid is generally much costlier, both in terms of dollars and internal morale.
Market Competitiveness:
Make Data-Supported Decisions
The next questions you should be asking yourself are whether employees are paid fairly relative to the market, and relatedly, whether the salary ranges you’re building are competitive relative to similar organizations (employee size, employee types, industry, etc.). In addition to internal equity, having strong market data to guide your decisions is going to be equally important for being able to both attract and retain employees.
There are many data sources out there - large compensation surveys, boutique service providers (such as ourselves!) and a handful of newer compensation benchmark platforms. In addition, your recruiters can also be an excellent source of data - if you’re not already, you should start to collect what you’re hearing from the candidate market as well. And ultimately, the ranges that companies will start to post as part of this law can also be relevant data to include as you iterate on salary ranges.
However, when reviewing any particular dataset, we would urge you to be a cautious consumer, in a few ways. Make sure you are reviewing the strength of the data. Many of the platforms out there have not yet hit the critical mass of data needed to draw strong conclusions: you want to know that once you start cutting the data by level, or job function (or other filters) that you’re not basing your compensation strategy from a small number of examples. In addition, you’ll want to watch out for any dataset that relies entirely or predominantly on self-reported data; that data often doesn’t cleanly control for user error, level, job function or type of company (or wealth of company).
Next, you’ll also want to keep an eye on the relevance of the data you’re choosing: does the data cover a wide enough swath of the market for it to be relevant? If the dataset only has smaller companies participating in the data, you’re not going to have a broad enough understanding of the wider market. If the dataset covers only the companies that pay in the top ten percent of the market, you run a similar risk in the other direction.
All that said, if you’re not yet in a place where you can invest in and analyze a larger market dataset (or hire an outside firm to do that work), as long as you are documenting and pulling from a wide variety of sources you should have enough of a starting point to be directionally correct.
Communication:
Context is Key
Once you have your salary ranges, communication should roll out from the top down. First, leadership must understand where the data comes from and what choices were made in the salary ranges so they can effectively own and be prepared for questions that come from all levels of the organization.
Next, your recruiters and hiring managers must understand how salary ranges work, as they are the front line for candidate communication. You can be one of the top paying companies in the market but if the people communicating to candidates don’t know how to explain your compensation strategy, employees are still going to feel as though they are paid unfairly.
The salary range itself is going to be based on a number of factors (level, job function, and geography, for example). Where someone falls within a salary range is also going to be based on multiple factors, like where they are in their career relative to the level, the experience they are bringing, making sure they are being paid fairly relative to other employees -- and as they grow at the company, their performance over time will also play a part at where they might fall within a salary range.
We wrote more about this in a post geared toward candidates. Recruiters and hiring managers must be educated to effectively communicate salary decisions and the company's pay practices, to help candidates understand that the company is operating fairly and intentionally.
And while it’s a heavy lift for communication, the ideal next group would be for all managers and employees to have the context around salary ranges. This doesn’t mean every salary range across level or job function needs to be shared with everyone, but we would suggest that people managers are knowledgeable about your compensation principles and practices (and that they have access to the information they need and can answer questions from their team) and then the needed information is shared with the broader employee group. The more people you are able to train to talk about and understand compensation, the better off you will be.
Post the Numbers… with Words!
Once you have established your ranges and equipped your recruiters and hiring managers to discuss them, you need to of course also put them in your job postings.
However, the salary information you post on the job description does not have to be just numbers. We would advise including some standard context on your salary ranges, to help anyone reading the job description understand how salary ranges work at your company.
While each company will be a little different, we would suggest adding language like this to give your salary ranges context:
Our salary ranges are based on paying competitively for our size and industry, and are one part of many compensation, benefits and other reward opportunities we provide.
Individual pay rate decisions are based on a number of factors, including qualifications for the role, experience level, skillset, and balancing internal equity relative to peers at the company. We expect the majority of the candidates who are offered roles at our company to fall healthily throughout the range based on these factors.
One pain point for many startups is that they post a role with expectations at a certain level but are open to candidates a level higher or lower during the search process. You may want to consider this as an add-on:
The range above is for the expectations as laid out in the job description, however we are often open to a wide variety of profiles, and recognize that the person we hire may be less experienced (or more senior) than this job description as posted. If that ends up being the case, the updated salary range will be communicated with you as a candidate.
If you have a geography-based strategy (as most companies do), we do recommend adding something similar to the example above.
The salary range above is for the New York City metro area. As a company, we have a location based strategy, which means the salary range could be lower or higher than this if the role is hired in another location.
Adhering to the salary transparency law may feel daunting, but once you establish your salary ranges you will see long-term positive effects - you’ll be able to open roles and decide raises in a straightforward and fair way, communicate with employees consistently, and plan for scale safely.

By: Chris DeCola
It’s that time of year again – the weather is getting colder, I’ve had at least two pumpkin spice lattes, and the faint whispers of annual planning and performance reviews are growing louder and louder. But in addition to the normal rhythm of end-of-year processes, this fall season comes with the added to-do of complying with NYC’s new pay transparency law.
As an HR and Compensation Consultant at Gray Scalable, I regularly help leaders define and communicate their compensation strategies. As part of this work, I’ve had a front-row seat to the concerns, goals, and philosophies of many different leadership teams, and am well-versed in the reality of what happens when a company starts to go “on the record” about how it pays. Below is some of the information that I’ve been sharing with my clients to guide them through this process.
A quick note: I am coming at this from an HR & comp planning perspective and my thoughts below reflect only that. If you have concerns about legal or compliance issues, you should talk to an employment attorney directly.
What does NYC’s Transparency Law require?
At a high level, effective November 1, 2022, employers with four or more workers, and with at least one worker in New York City, are required to post a salary range for any job within the City or that could be performed remotely by someone living in NYC. The last bit is really important for hybrid and remote hiring environments – it means that even if you aren’t primarily hiring the role out of NYC, if you are open to candidates in the NYC area, you must post a salary range for the role.
The salary range must include the lowest and highest salaries or hourly rates that the employer believes that it would reasonably pay (“in good faith”) for the job, promotion, or transfer, at the time of the posting. The law only requires you to share individual salary ranges in job postings, so you do not have to share the ranges for all roles internally with your team.
What does it mean for your organization?
It means that effective November 1, 2022, you must post the salary range for all roles that you are currently hiring for in NYC or that can be performed remotely by an NYC resident. It also means that you likely have some work to do internally, as you’ll need to solidify your existing compensation practices and manage the expectations of your employees.
In an ideal world, all of your employees already have a deep understanding of your compensation philosophy and pay strategies, understand how different factors like job function or geography impact your pay ranges, know how levels are structured at your company, and have been walked through how their mix of tenure, performance, and experience all factor into their compensation.
I don’t know about you, but I do not live in this ideal world. I instead live in one where employers are well-intentioned and employees are curious, and where compensation has been a black box for so long that everyone’s a little bit confused about how to best move forward.
Even if you are not in a position to communicate your full compensation philosophy to staff, there is some information that you can share with your managers and employees to help them understand how you pay and how the salary ranges in your job descriptions came to fruition. Consider sharing:
- Information about the law itself (when it goes into effect, what is required, etc.);
- What data you used to form your salary ranges and any decisions you made as part of that process (e.g. did you use a dataset from your VC or a market comp provider, did you decide to have different ranges for people who live in different parts of the country, do different job functions have different ranges, etc.);
- How decisions are made about where someone’s compensation sits within their relevant salary range; and
- How managers should answer some common questions about their employees’ compensation (e.g. “why aren’t I paid at the top of my range?”). For more information on this one, check out this blog post.
What should you consider putting in your job descriptions?
There are a handful of decisions to make about what information to share and how you want to share it. Some broader topics to consider addressing are:
- What ranges to use: If you only have one set of ranges, those are the salary ranges you should use. However, some organizations have salary ranges for hiring/headcount budgeting purposes that sit within broader salary ranges for each level. Hiring ranges are often condensed and take into account what an organization can afford to pay for a role and what peers are making to ensure internal equity. Organizations can choose to use their hiring ranges in lieu of the full level’s salary range so long as the posted range represents what you expect to pay for the open role.
- How to talk about different locations: By law, you are required to post the salary range that you would pay in good faith for a role that is based in NYC or could be performed remotely in NYC. In the case of remote roles, you need to decide how you want to handle the situation where you post the NYC range but hire someone in a different location (who might have expectations of the higher NYC range). Some companies may choose to share multiple ranges for different locations or may simply state that the range is only for NYC-based roles.
The words that accompany your salary range numbers are important too. You’ll want to include some additional context for candidates reading your job description so they understand a bit more about your compensation strategies. See below for some sample language you can adapt for your organization:
“The minimum annual salary for this position is $50,000 and the maximum is $75,000. The salary range for performing this role outside of New York City will differ. Additionally, you will be eligible to participate in our company’s equity program, plus our robust medical, dental, vision, retirement, and other benefits.”
--
“(NYC only*) Minimum Salary of $50,000 - $75,000 + annual bonus + equity + benefits.
*Disclosure as required by S9427A of the minimum and maximum salary compensation range for this role when being hired into our offices in NYC or being performed remotely in NYC.”
--
“For NYC-based roles: Minimum annual salary of $50,000 and maximum annual salary of $75,000. You may also be offered a bonus, equity grant, and benefits.
Please note this role is open to candidates outside of New York City as well. The information below is provided for those hired in NYC only.
If you are a New York City applicant:
- The estimated pay range for this role, based in New York City, is $50,000 - $75,000.
- This role will be eligible to participate in our company's annual bonus program and equity program
Our salary ranges are based on paying competitively for our size and industry, and are one part of many compensation, benefits and other reward opportunities we provide.
Individual pay rate decisions are based on a number of factors, including qualifications for the role, experience level, skill set, and balancing internal equity relative to peers at the company.
The range above is for the expectations as laid out in the job description, however we are often open to a wide variety of profiles, and recognize that the person we hire may be less experienced (or more senior) than this job description as posted. If that ends up being the case, the updated salary range will be communicated to you as a candidate.”
--
If you do not factor location into your salary ranges:
“The base salary for this role is between $50,000 and $75,000, depending on skill set and experience level. Our compensation program is geographically-neutral, meaning that we do not adjust our pay ranges based on where you live, so this salary range applies to all candidates.”
--
How does this work for a sales role?
“For NYC-based roles: The base salary range for this role is $50,000 - $55,000. You will also participate in our company’s Sales Incentive Plan, and should you achieve your goals, the OTE for this role will be between $100,000 - $110,000.”
Is there anything else to consider?
Wage transparency laws are continuing to pick up steam across the US and for good reason - they are aimed at addressing and reducing the wage gaps experienced by underrepresented folks, especially women of color. Several states have already enacted them, have amended existing laws to provide greater transparency for employees and job seekers, or have passed new laws that will go into effect next year.
I think this should be a moment of reflection for all employers, especially in the tech community, to take stock of their compensation philosophy (does the organization have one, is it where it needs to be as the organization has evolved), their compensation structures (are they easy to understand, use, and talk about), and their approach to communicating about pay within and outside of the walls of their organizations.
The longstanding idea that compensation information is for “HR and Leadership’s eyes only” is quickly becoming a thing of the past. Equipping your managers with the important skill of effectively talking about pay, and giving your employees the foundational knowledge of how pay works and what to expect, will reap incredible dividends for your organization (and for your employees) in the future.

What’s your gut reaction when you hear the dreaded term Performance Improvement Plan? Or even worse - the chipper acronym, PIP? If you’re like most people – employee or manager - you might cringe and think, waste of time, guess I’m fired, administrative nightmare, HR BS.
I’m an optimist, and not surprisingly, a believer that the PIP process can truly help employees do what it says: improve an employee’s performance. When done right, a PIP can help a company make an informed decision about whether the employee’s performance is salvageable, or if it’s time to part ways. And from the employee’s point of view, it ideally paints a clear picture of management’s expectations so that the employee can decide to go all-in to improve, or to polish up the resume and consider other options - with a little runway to figure it out.
With that in mind, here are 5 common pitfalls of performance improvement planning - and some ideas for management about how to avoid them.
Waiting until it’s an emergency. If the employee’s performance is hurting the business (or if they’re making everyone crazy), it’s probably already too late. Try to keep your antennae up and watch for indications that someone is either disengaged or simply doesn’t have the skills. Along those lines, PIPs should never come as a surprise. Keep the lines of communication open, and give your employee the benefit of clear expectations and realistic goals.
Assuming failure. There’s nothing worse than sitting across from an employee and delivering a plan that’s ostensibly for their improvement, while not feeling genuine about its potential for success. You’ll know it, and they’ll know it - which will make it feel like a mere formality on the road to getting fired. If you’ve already decided that the employee won’t succeed and cannot stay with the company, take the time to challenge that assumption. Have you really been clear about the severity of the situation? Are you being fair? Have you given the employee enough chances to improve? Assuming failure or putting an unrealistic PIP in place can have legal implications, too.
Being Heartless. Even if failure seems likely, don’t forget to be human. Treat everyone how you’d like to be treated (yes, even those you’ve gotten pretty sick of). Once you’ve set out on a fair path and have a PIP in place, do the things you said you’d do. Don’t ditch weekly check-in appointments. Be fully present in those meetings. Don’t treat the employee like a social pariah - include them in formal and informal company social outings. And definitely don’t tell people who don’t need to know that they’re on a plan. It’s impossible to recover from gossip about that. Assume this will succeed and give them a real chance.
And if it’s clear midway through the plan that they’re not going to make it, there’s no need to prolong the agony - if your HR business partner insists on letting the plan go to day 90, you’ll still want to discuss how you’ll manage the employee’s remaining time on the plan.
Having too much heart. It’s easy to “nice” your way out of having to give a tough message, but it doesn’t help anyone. For example, it’s tempting to move a problem employee by transferring to another team versus going through the whole PIP process. But in the end, if you haven’t addressed the performance problem before the transfer, it turns out to be the opposite of a nice thing to do. The employee goes through onboarding pains again and likely has the same problems after a few months. The receiving manager gets a frustrated employee with fundamental performance problems. Doesn’t help your credibility as a leader either.
It’s hard to address performance problems head-on - especially those that are subjective, like the way someone doesn’t get along with the team. But you’re ultimately helping the business and the individual if you find the balance between being too kind and doing the right thing in a kind way.
Not phoning a(n HR) friend. It’s admirable to take ownership of performance managing and coaching your employees. But if it has gone past coaching, and into the realm of the employee’s performance putting their job (or your company) at risk, it really is time to partner with HR. You’ll only frustrate yourself if you get to the point where you just want to call HR to rush to terminate someone. Rushing to take action pretty much never flies, so you might as well chat with HR early and often.
I’ve seen PIPs result in employees staying with a company, and truly improving their performance, as often as not. But sometimes, you end up having to make that tough call at the end of the PIP. Either way, I hope these tips help you along the way.

Here's Charlie's guest post on Greenhouse's blog. Greenhouse is hosting an event in a couple of weeks, where Charlie will be speaking on this hot topic. We’d love to see you there! RSVP today!
You’ve grown out of the startup stage–what next?
Companies evolve over time, from the chaos and urgency of the early stage start-up to the structure and predictability that is essential to a mature enterprise. How companies hire naturally follows this evolution. Since the types of people who make startups successful are often not the types that make sense for a more mature business (and vice-versa) it’s important to that your hiring process evolves to address that evolution.
At a startup, the first dozen hires are usually:
More similar than diverse, coming from the same relatively small network of people
More generalist than specialist – they figure out what jobs they need to do and learn them
Highly passionate about the business itself, less interested in their career progression
In a startup environment populated by these people, too much structure can be a problem, and these people/companies thrive in a culture of flexibility and minimal boundaries. Hiring decisions are often made quickly and based on personal experience and relationships, as opposed to a thoughtful and objective interview process. This can lead to mistakes, but that’s ok because startups need to take risks and make mistakes, it’s a great way to iterate and learn.
A successful growth stage–that period of time between startup and maturity –when the company experiences its “adolescence” and gradually introduces process to prevent mistakes and make better decisions, requires a thoughtful and objective approach to recruiting.
Hiring for a growth stage company should start with a definition of who you’re looking for:
Does the position you’re hiring for require a startup mindset, or someone who knows how to scale the business efficiently?
What type of personal motivation will make someone want this job and be successful in this job? What qualities are good or bad for this?
Do you need another person from the same background as the rest, or should we be actively diversifying the team?
Does everyone on the hiring team agree about what you need? (This is a great place to start the conversation)
Hiring managers in the growth stage need to work through these and other questions about their hires, as well as create a thoughtful recruiting process if they’re going to identify and attract the right people. This is when relying on your networks and your instinct isn’t enough, and the science of hiring becomes critical.

Every day still feels new and exciting because of the unique way we work!
Every day, I get the opportunity to work with growth stage startups and act as an internal member of their team while helping them hire. As embedded recruiters, we embed into our clients’ HR and recruiting teams, to understand their culture, advise on strategy, and provide exclusive sourcing and hiring support. We get to know our clients from the inside out, so every new client is a new workplace and opportunity. Doing this combines my love of meeting new people and constantly learning new things. I count myself lucky to be welcomed by these teams as an internal member, and cherish every engagement I’ve worked on.
At Gray Scalable we have a variety of clients and are given the opportunity to work with 4-8 every year! My past clients have included Buzzfeed, Olo, mParticle, Skillshare and more. In recruiting for these teams I get to talk to numerous candidates from different places and backgrounds, which makes every day different from the day before. Speaking with them about their career journeys always leaves me reflecting on my own.
This past year has been tough for all of us, but I have never felt closer to my team and excited about our company’s direction and the year ahead. As I reflect on my past six years, I don’t have that feeling of “where to next” as some may feel after being at the same company for so long - my feelings skew more towards “What’s next for Gray Scalable?” We’ve come a long way in two years, and I look forward to seeing what the next few bring. Right now, we’re growing the team - check out our open jobs!
I feel so lucky to get to do this for 6 years - and I can’t wait for another 6 or more to Grow with Gray!"

103,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/thinking-about-salary-transparency,"At Gray Scalable, we spend a lot of time working with companies to mature their compensation practices, and at a certain point we always get the same question:
“Should we have salary transparency?”
It can be a daunting concept to even the most people-first leaders, but with salary transparency laws becoming more common and employees feeling more empowered to ask for compensation info, it’s a necessary conversation.
Here’s what to consider as you decide what’s right for your org.
***
Do you have alignment on what salary transparency means?
The phrase “salary transparency” can scare leadership teams, but that’s usually because they don’t understand their options or have full alignment on what is feasible and best for their team. A shift to salary transparency can look a few different ways:
- The company shares its compensation philosophy and pay strategy, but does not disclose salary ranges.
- Each employee knows the salary range they’re currently in.
- Each employee knows the salary range they’re currently within and the range above them.
- All salary ranges by level/seniority, type of job, and geography are shared internally.
- All employee salaries are shared internally.
All of these give employees more insight than knowing just their own salary, and each gives varying levels of increased information. And remember, you can shift to more transparency over time, but it’s very difficult to roll back decisions. A common scenario for a company looking to offer transparency is to start with Option 1 or 2 and then move toward Options 3 and 4.
Are you ready for salary transparency?
Before you consider salary transparency, you have to make sure you are in a safe position to do so. We generally recommend that companies act like their salaries could be fully transparent, even if they’re not - would you be able to explain your decisions? This means the work to prepare yourself for salary transparency is the same work every org should be doing no matter what is shared with employees. An org is ready to think about salary transparency when:
- You have documented, consistent salary bands.
- You’ve made decisions as to how you’re going to handle employees living in different geographies and working in different types of jobs.
- You’ve addressed any internal issues around pay equity and consistent pay practices.
- You are committed to adhering to your salary bands moving forward.
- You have assessed if your managers are ready to discuss compensation and have the capacity to support them in compensation conversations as needed.
- You’ve discussed how salary transparency might impact or tie to other related initiatives such as: performance reviews and your raise process.
The benefits of salary transparency
Again, salary transparency can make org leaders nervous but there are a number of benefits to consider:
- Salary transparency engenders trust and can reduce attrition. Being able to talk about how you pay can positively change an employee's understanding of compensation. Even in a scenario where an employee is unhappy with their salary or salary band, the suspicion that the org is hiding anything from them is reduced. It’s a way to show that you are making a good faith effort to be fair and straightforward with employees.
- Offering some level of salary transparency makes the communication path clearer and cleaner for associated conversations such as: career paths & growth, raises, salary implications of moving teams/role/geography. Once you have a consistent system for decisions and have shared it, you can have better conversations with employees about where they stand and where there’s room for improvement.
- Sharing info about salary ranges gives employees some understanding of what is possible when it comes to a potential raise. This can also be a challenge (more on that below), but if an employee understands your compensation framework and salary bands they are more likely to make requests that align with how you pay, versus citing a number they found online or from speaking with friends.
- It can help with hiring. Having some version of internal salary transparency means you don’t need to worry about any potential awkwardness if/when you share salary ranges with job postings. Employees will already have some context for the ranges you’re posting rather than seeing them “in the wild” and making their own assumptions. Salary transparency can also be used as part of your employer branding efforts and be compelling to candidates looking for a more progressive workplace.
- If you’re trying to tie concrete actions back to your stated values or results from an engagement or inclusion survey, salary transparency can be a big win. It’s considered foundational to equity work, as well as fostering trust and communication between employees and leadership.
The challenges of salary transparency
There are, of course, challenges to salary transparency. Compensation can be a fraught topic, and it’s important to know the work ahead:
- With increased transparency employees can more easily see the pay differences between different roles, levels, and geographies. They may be unhappy with where they are paid in their role’s salary range or how their salary range compares to that of another team. They may also disagree with your overall approach to compensation. If done well, you will have data and reasoning to back up your compensation philosophy and how you’ve decided to pay everyone, but that may not satisfy some employees and can lead to challenging conversations. In addition to the time these conversations take, they can take an emotional toll on both employees and managers.
- There is a potential cost to increased salary transparency. As noted above, employees may use info on salary ranges to advocate for themselves. Even if you feel someone is paid appropriately, it’s common for a company to feel pressured to give more raises while shifting to transparency, as they want to retain high performers and show they’re open to compensation conversations.
- The roll out of salary transparency will take time and effort, especially from HR, leadership, and managers. To optimize the benefits of salary transparency it’s important to train managers in how compensation decisions are made and how to talk about these decisions. An org needs to be very thoughtful about how salary info is shared with staff and give space and time for everyone to meet with their manager to discuss. To not do so both undercuts the value of salary transparency and can potentially do more damage than not having transparency at all.
- Rolling out salary ranges is not a “set it and forget it” exercise, especially in the current competitive and shifting market. The company will need to have resources committed to keeping up with the market and making adjustments when needed.
There is no “right” answer when it comes to deciding about salary transparency, and no matter your enthusiasm there will inevitably be bumps in making a shift. That said, deciding what’s right for your company is an important conversation - just make sure you’re balancing employee needs with the company’s capacity and readiness.

105,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog/transitioningfromthestartupworldtothenonprofitsector,"Have you been grinding in hyper growth, constantly working towards a high ARR, profitability, and building a product for investors obsessed with runway? This is exciting and can be rewarding, but perhaps you have been there, done that or even - been recently laid off and are now wondering what's next. You are not alone. During this Great Layoff in the tech industry - many folks are craving something different and applying those tech skills to join a tech-enabled non-profit could be that rewarding and fulfilling next chapter in your career.
Despite the misperception that life at non-profits can move slowly, many tech-enabled non-profits move at a blistering pace and require a ton of innovation, creativity, and autonomy. At Gray Scalable, we partner with these types of organizations (some of them listed below) and introduce them to tech professionals who want to work at them.
In this article, we will explore how to transition from the high-tech startup world to the non-profit sector, utilizing your skills and experience to make a meaningful contribution to a mission-driven organization. We will discuss key factors to consider when making the transition, including networking, volunteering, upskilling, and being patient. We will also touch on the importance of considering your overall needs, both monetarily and otherwise, when making the switch to a mission-driven organization.
Understanding the Non-profit Landscape
The non-profit sector is a diverse and complex landscape, encompassing organizations that range in size, scope, and mission. It is important to take the time to understand the nuances of the non-profit world and the unique challenges and opportunities it presents.
One of the key differences between the high-tech startup world and the non-profit sector is the funding model. Unlike startups that typically rely on venture capital or angel investors, non-profits often rely on a mix of government grants, individual donations, and corporate sponsorships. This means that fundraising is a critical part of the non-profit world, and a key skill set for anyone looking to make the transition.
Another important factor to consider is the mission and values of the non-profit organization. While many high-tech startups are focused on maximizing profits, nonprofits are mission-driven and focused on creating social impact. This means that the culture and values of the organization will be different, and it is important to be passionate about the mission and aligned with the values of the organization.
Applying your Skills and Experience
While the non-profit sector may seem very different from the high-tech startup world, there are many skills and experiences that can be applied in both environments. For example, skills in project management, data analysis, and digital marketing are all highly valuable in the non-profit sector.
One area where high-tech startup experience can be particularly valuable is in the use of technology. Many non-profit organizations are increasingly reliant on technology to deliver their programs and services, and there is a growing demand for individuals with technical skills and experience.
Another area where high-tech startup experience can be valuable is in the area of innovation and creativity. Non-profit organizations are constantly looking for new and innovative ways to create social impact, and individuals with experience in developing new products and services can bring a fresh perspective to the nonprofit world.
Making the Transition
When considering making this transition there are several steps you can take to make the transition as smooth as possible:
- Network: Attend events and connect with individuals in the non-profit sector to gain a better understanding of the landscape and potential opportunities.
- Volunteer: Consider volunteering with a non-profit organization to gain hands-on experience and build relationships within the sector.
- Upskill: Look for opportunities to develop new skills that are relevant to the nonprofit sector, such as fundraising, grant writing, or project management.
- It's not just about money: When making the switch from a for-profit company to a mission-driven non-profit, it's important to look beyond cash compensation and consider your overall needs. Decide before interviewing what's important to you, both monetarily and otherwise. Working on products and teams aligned by a shared mission that resonates with you can be incredibly rewarding, and many nonprofits offer benefits and perks that bring real value to your total rewards package.
- Reach out to a firm like Gray Scalable, with extensive experience helping tech professionals make this transition.
In conclusion, transitioning from the high-tech and startup world to the tech-enabled non-profit sector can be a challenging but rewarding experience. With the help of organizations like Gray Scalable, CTOs, Product Leaders, Engineers, Business and People Leaders can successfully navigate the transition and make a meaningful contribution to an organization that is focused on creating social impact. By understanding the nuances of the non-profit landscape, applying your skills and experience, and taking the necessary steps to make the transition, you can find a fulfilling career that aligns with your values and makes a positive impact on the world.

By: Sam Feldman
Advice for Job Candidates from a Compensation Design Professional
My team's job is to help companies develop and improve their pay practices, but I'd like to flip the script and write a post that’s geared toward helping candidates & employees understand a bit of what goes on behind the scenes, especially as more companies will be publishing salary ranges in their job postings in the coming months.
This information comes with these acknowledgements:
- Everyone deserves to be paid competitively and fairly (and as highly as they can be, if that is their goal).
- No one should have to go through hours of interviews before knowing compensation information about the role.
- My experience is mostly limited to the broader tech market, where the team spends most of their time on compensation design for full-time and salaried employee roles.
- My experience is with well over a hundred companies, all of whom are trying to pay people fairly - but I know there are plenty of bad actors out there who purposefully lowball employees, and the perspective offered in this post is not meant to deny or downplay those cases.
The purpose of these observations is to hopefully provide some context and clarity about the process (and common pitfalls) from the companies that do have candidates’ best interests in mind, which is a lot of them. So here goes!
For most roles, there is no perfect number. One thing I’ve noticed when fielding employee questions (and reading Twitter threads) is that there seems to be an underlying assumption that companies have perfect information about the salary they should offer a candidate based on their exact skills and experience.
Even the most robust market data has a range, and sometimes there isn’t a strong match in the data to a candidate’s specific blend of skills. In addition, many smaller companies may be hiring for the role for the first time, or don’t yet have access to these larger compensation datasets, and find themselves having to speak to a few early candidates to learn or validate what some of those real-time numbers might be.
…but there is strong compensation information out there. Even though not every role has a ‘perfect’ number, most larger companies (and plenty of smaller ones) will have a defined compensation strategy, which means there is likely a data-backed salary range for your role or general job function.
Where you fall in that range should be a combination of:
- Where you are in your career. A common misconception is that if you aren’t offered the top of the salary range, then you’re being shortchanged. At many companies, where you fall in a salary range is partially a function of where you are in your career relative to that level.
If you are new (or new-ish) to the level and the expectations, you may be offered a salary in the lower half. The idea being that you’ll spend time in the position, getting increases and growing in your role before getting a promotion, without going ‘above range’. Conversely, if you are coming into a position where you have already been doing that exact role for a few years and will soon get promoted, you will likely be in the top half.
Where we see friction is when the company goes to market looking for a less experienced profile than the candidate they end up interviewing (and loving). It takes a conscious step in the process for the hiring manager and the company to get on board with hiring a more senior/more expensive profile than they had originally intended. Or they may not really have the ability to stretch the budget in that way, and just hope you like the opportunity and will take the offer.
The other similar friction point occurs when a hiring manager wants, say, a “Director of Marketing,” but they want to hire a person who has been doing that exact role for three years at a similar or larger company … and is surprised when that person wants the top end of the salary range, or requests the compensation or title of the next level up in order to leave their current position.
- Where you are relative to peers within the company. Most companies will try to manage internal fairness as well, making sure you as a candidate don’t come in much higher or lower than similar employees on the team. This can be a great thing, as it often reduces pay equity issues across demographics like gender and ethnicity, and is just a generally fair way to manage compensation at a company.
The pitfall is that sometimes employee pay has not kept pace with market salaries, and it hinders offering the candidate a higher salary, as they’d be significantly out-earning their new peers. Sometimes your request for a higher salary than anticipated can be part of a data story that helps a recruiter make a case for higher pay, or to get the companies’ market competitiveness reviewed.
- Any special skills or experience you’re bringing to the table. The two factors above are often balanced with any more unique situations, like whether you have a skillset that is unique relative to peers.
However, in order to warrant higher pay, that skillset needs to be specifically relevant to the company you are joining (for example, past experience scaling a particular type of team or platform). It’s not usually about whether you can speak another language or have a more advanced degree, unless that’s specifically relevant. We’ve often seen confusion from candidates who come from industries like academia or the public sector where there is an expectation that a specific number of years of experience or type of degree means a set amount of increase in pay. In the tech sector (and many other industries), this is usually not the case.
‘Market’ is not Facebook (unless you’re Facebook). The above section talked about where you might be paid within a salary range, but this section covers what (and how high) that salary range might be.
In general, where a company sets its pay rates is going to be a function of their size, financials, and general compensation philosophy, which includes how they value the other aspects of total rewards, like equity, benefits, or development.
The big players in the market (the group often referred to as ‘FAANG’, or Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix…. and others) are ones that target the top end of the pay market for any given role or job function. These companies report tens of billions of profits every year, if not much more. Smaller tech companies -- and even larger public ones -- often don’t have the finances to support the same rates. What’s surprising here is actually how close to these rates some VC-backed and mid-sized firms can get; there’s actually a handful of overlap between some of the salary ranges between these companies.
I think if there’s one thing these smaller companies would want you to understand is that they are not trying to lowball you by not matching the compensation of a top five (or top twenty) company. If max comp is what you’re looking for… go for it! But once you have a competitive offer from a company, it’s a choice of balancing the compensation package offered and the opportunity itself: it could be the professional growth, the mission, the culture, the people or anything else that you might be valuing outside of pay.
Hopefully this post helped shed some light on the tech compensation market. There’s plenty more to cover too - we’re not even diving into the complexity of benefits, equity, and other comp components - perhaps for another day! Feel free to leave a note in the comments or let us know what you think."

108,https://www.grayscalable.com/blog3/life-in-the-age-of-pay-cut-decisions,"Life in the age of pay cut decisions
By: Sam Feldman
In the wake of coronavirus, most companies exist on a continuum from completely unaffected to large layoffs and unfortunate closure. I don’t envy the executives, human resources and finance teams (among others) who have to make these decisions, and my hope is that this post will soon be out of date as we get back to normal.
In the meantime, this post is for the companies who need to conserve cash by more than just withholding merit or bonus pools; it’s for organizations that are considering pay cuts to base salary. Below I’ve outlined the two most common scenarios we’ve seen implemented, how they work, and what the pros and cons are of each.
Across the Board Percentage
The simplest approach to a pay discount is to give all employees the same percentage reduction across the board, like 20%. While technically ‘fair’, there is a greater real-life impact to employees at lower pay rates. An employee making 45k moving down to 36k is likely going to have a much harder time with month-to-month living than someone who moves from 125k to 100k. So this approach works well if you are an organization that has a very narrow range of salaries, or everyone is paid very highly. Having a flat 20% discount is also an option we’ve seen used as a way to have everyone work 80% hours (four out of five days) and still keep benefits.
In the below graph, the gray line represents all salaries from 35k-200k with no change to base pay. The orange line represents an across the board cut of 20% to salaries. So someone making $120,000 would have their salary adjusted to $96,000. However, if the salary isn’t being adjusted for a full year, the ‘effective annual salary’ will be higher. In the example below, a company is choosing to do a 20% pay cut for three months (or six pay periods, assuming 24 pay periods a year). This means the person is paid $120,000 for nine months of the year, and $96,000 for three months, resulting in an effective annualized salary of $114,000.
Impact of Adjusting Discounting Base Pay by 20%
Discounts Tiered by Base Salary
As mentioned above, the ‘across the board’ approach has a major drawback; employees at lower pay rates will feel the cut more deeply than those making more. The tiered approach solves for this by grouping salaries into tiers and implementing progressively larger percentage discounts for each tier. This seems to be the most common approach taken by companies who need to institute a pay cut.
In the below graph, the blue lines show four tiers of pay discount:
75k and Under 10% Pay Reduction
76k-100k 15%
101k-150k 20%
151k and above 25%
Impact of Tiered Approach to Base Pay Discounts
Here, an employee making 50k would move down to 45k (10%) as opposed to the 40k (20%) in the across-the-board model.
One potential downside here is for employees who are within a few thousand dollars of a cut-off point. Using the graph above, an employee making $101,000 will get a 20% discount to $80,800 but an employee making $99k will receive a 15% discount to $84,150, and technically be better off. However, the math around effective annual salary matters here - assuming that the pay cuts are only for a few months and the percentage discounts between groups is relatively small (about 5%), the difference in earnings between the two employees will be almost negligible. The longer the pay cuts and/or the larger the percentage difference between tiers, the more the difference between employees around the cut-off point is realized.
There’s more: as a complement to this post, we’ve created an interactive dashboard (screenshot below) if you’d like to experiment with employee impact of pay cuts.
In this dashboard, you can adjust:
- The number of pay periods being discounted
- If you’re going for the across-the-board discount like the one described first in this post, you can adjust where it says “Flat Discount %” (everything in orange will relate to the across-the-board approach).
- If you want to look at the tiered approach, you can adjust the four cutoff boxes on the bottom right and see the impact to pay (all in blue).
Other than that, please drop us a line if you have thoughts or comments!

By: Charlie Gray
10 MORE NEW HIRES IN 6 MONTHS - WHAT DO YOU DO?
Is this a familiar situation?
You’re in charge of People, or Talent, or People and Talent, and your company is a start-up growing >50% a year. You just found out you need 10 more engineering hires than you were expecting - and ideally they should all be hired in the next quarter. Your CEO says this is business critical.
What do you do? Consider the options:
Keep things the same - add to your current team’s workload
Hire another recruiter
Consider 3rd party options
Option 1: Just do more.
Unless you and your team have a lot of excess capacity, such as a whole person doing nothing, it’s really unlikely that option 1 will work for your organization. Something’s got to give, in order for option 1 to work, such as deprioritizing hiring for another area of the business, which is unlikely a viable plan during a time of fast growth. Your CEO has given you a mandate - you should be committing additional resources to ensure it’s successful. Asking everyone to work more, or taking on more yourself, may feel heroic in the moment, but it’s not sustainable, and it won’t work. Hope is not a plan.
So let’s consider options 2 and 3:
Option 2: Hire another recruiter.
If you expect to have ongoing hiring at this new volume, you should definitely hire another recruiter. Good in-house resources are the best solution for long term hiring. However keep in mind that hiring good recruiters takes about as long as hiring a good engineer - which is a long time. Great recruiters are in high demand, and it's worthwhile hard work to hire them. Whoever you hire will not be in place for a quarter, and won't be making hires at volume until a quarter after starting. You might be tempted to lower your standard by hiring a readily available but unproven tech recruiter, but don't. You risk missing your targets, and more importantly, you risk damaging your employment brand. Your situation requires a more immediate solution that you can run in parallel with your search for a full time qualified recruiter.
Option 3: Consider Third Party Options
In parallel to hiring for your team, if you’ll have sustained need, now is a good time to consider your third party options. Bringing in a third party solution can be a daunting proposition for many heads of talent in start-ups. You’re scrappy, ambitious and results-oriented, and you have a strong inclination to take everything on internally. However, knowing when to bring in third party help during workload spikes is not a sign of weakness, it is a reflection of strategic thinking about real solutions for challenging problems. Partner with other stakeholders in your company, the head of finance, the CTO - and present the facts and the available options and pros and cons.
There are three kinds of third parties to consider:
Contract Recruiters
Agencies
Embedded Recruiting support
Aren’t contract recruiters an easy fix?
If only it were that easy. This sounds like a great answer, from a cost standpoint, since it’s a non-committed resource you can turn on and off as needed. But, if you haven’t yet learned this the hard way, talk to some of your peers that have: there aren’t many contractors out there, particularly in tech recruiting, that will give you the productivity you need. The hiring process takes about as long as hiring a full-time employee - and many contractors aren’t career-contractors, and would prefer a full time job - so you may as well just do that, and use other third party resources in the meantime. And, if you’re really not ready to hire a full time employee, and hire a contractor anyway, you run the risk of the contractor leaving for an internal role elsewhere.
Use an agency (or 2, or 3…)
Contingent agencies have a place in the recruiting mix. Some agency recruiters have good experience and strong networks, and can provide you with some good candidates. They’re a useful way to supplement your sourcing channels.
However - this is not a reliable solution, as they only do part of the job of hiring. Those good candidates they have presented to you are being shopped to 5 other companies to increase the agency’s odds of placement.
Contingency recruiters have no real commitment to helping you versus helping any other company - their primary objective is getting their candidate hired fastest, but not necessarily by you. Basically, your interests and theirs are not aligned, and mutual success is almost random. They might get you a couple of good hires - but not all or most of them. And, to increase your odds, you probably need to work with a few of them to get some success. Someone on your team will spend a fair amount of time just managing these relationships, which can become almost a full-time job in itself, further distracting from other internal hiring needs.
Have you tried (or even heard of?) embedded recruiting?
The founders of Gray Scalable have been in your shoes multiple times. As HR/talent leaders, we knew the limitations of all the options. We ultimately succeeded in our roles by building great internal teams - but when we started Gray Scalable eight years ago, our mission was to figure out how to provide the same level, results, and value that great internal teams bring - but immediately to our clients and without long-term commitment. In other words, what would a really good third party solution look like?
Embedded recruiting means that our teams become an extension of yours, during the time of the engagement. We immerse in your culture, by working onsite, and by partnering directly with hiring managers, interviewers, and members of the People team. We’re a blend of an internal team and a third party. Essentially, when we started Gray Scalable, we gave ourselves a goal: can we really provide a best-of-both-worlds solution?
We think so! Our model includes:
A commitment to making the hires you need
We’re in it with you, managing roles holistically - not just providing top-of-funnel sourcing support. Unlike agencies, we won’t turn off the tap if things aren’t going well - we’ll work with you on all aspects of the recruiting process, to troubleshoot and advise on best practices, identify and solve your hiring obstacles, and commit to getting the job done.
A working partnership to build sustainable practices
We’re meant to be a short-term solution, but we build long-term practices. We partner with internal teams to build sustainable interviewing and hiring frameworks, and help create a culture of recruiting within your organization.
Some of our clients bring us in when they haven’t yet selected their ATS, for example. We make it our business to know and understand the latest HR SaaS offerings, and will help with rollout of ATSes, like Greenhouse, to help drive adoption and use. We also have a compensation practice at Gray Scalable and can provide market-based advice on competitive salaries in the fast-changing world of tech hiring.
Managing all channels of hiring
By managing the entire pipeline of a requisition, we give your organization the best chance at hiring the best people for your roles. Unlike agencies, we drive and manage your inbound candidate pool, your internal referral program, and engage in outbound sourcing. We help you hire the best candidate - not “our” candidate - removing unnecessary bias (and conflict) from the hiring process.
While we do believe our model sets our clients up to make the best hires at scale, we also understand it is different and can take some getting used to. To be successful our model also requires true partnership and engagement from our clients - so, before taking on an engagement, we will encourage a mutual assessment of fit.
These successful partnerships are what motivate us every day, and we’ve been fortunate to work with many of the leading tech companies in NYC and elsewhere. One example: Two years ago, we meet with Luke Vnenchak at BuzzFeed about growing their engineering team and ended up partnering in many ways with one of our all-time biggest clients. Luke sent us this note about the team he’d been working with a year later:
Gray Scalable has been a true partner for us as we've grown our engineering team. They have given great advice on process that is catered specifically to our strengths and challenges as an organization. The diversity on our teams has increased as we have worked with them, and I have a ton of confidence in how they communicate with candidates throughout the hiring experience.

Our Founders' Story
Our founders first met in 2005, when Charlie hired Deb onto his HR and Recruiting team at Google. Deb and Charlie have a shared history of building high-performing recruitment and people teams, while at the same time, creating scalable processes.
After serving as Chief People Officer at a series of growing start-ups, Charlie founded Gray Scalable in 2012, to bring People insights and best practices to companies that didn’t yet have HR leadership or the resources to effectively grow and manage their teams. Following her time in HR and recruitment leadership at startups and F500 organizations, Deb joined in 2013 as cofounder, to further develop our practices and scale the business recruiting team. Together, they have grown the company’s team, products, and offerings, with offices in NYC and LA.

Find senior level leaders to fill current needs, and meet future challenges.
What is executive search?
Executive search is the process of defining, identifying, attracting, assessing and hiring candidates for senior-level leadership positions at an organization. At this level, employees must have not only the skills, knowledge and experience required for the job, they must also share the vision for a company’s future and be able to execute strategies to reach company goals.
Skills required for executive search
The skills required to be exceptional at executive search, or retained search, are similar to those of strong recruiters anywhere: good communication and listening skills, multitasking and organizational skills, and more.
However, for executive search, a recruiter can’t just be good in these areas: they must be outstanding. The expectations of a candidate for a senior-level position are likely to be much higher than candidates for more junior roles. A recruiter that meets these expectations – in communications, in understanding of the position and the industry, etc. – will make a better impression on candidates and enable them to build rapport with people, and ultimately to advise them about their suitability, evaluate the company “fit” and help shepard them through the interview and consideration process.
Executive searches must also begin with a process of diligence and assessment, including gathering input from stakeholders, ensuring alignment, determining the “must-have” qualities or experiences, and advising a client company about candidate talent pools and profiles. This helps to avoid weeks of time spent pursuing unqualified or over-qualified candidates, and focuses the search on identifying the best fits for the Company and the immediate team. This is part of the reason why search recruiters are paid on a retainer basis, as the value of their work starts with defining the role and advising the client, not just with producing resumes.
Executive Search at Startups
Filling a senior-level position at a startup is even more complicated. Small startups are often competing for top talent with larger, more established companies whose employer brand is known, whose business seems more secure, and often, who can offer a heftier compensation and benefits package. To compete, a startup needs an executive search professional that has all of the recruitment skills previously mentioned, but is also able to help candidates see past any short-term disadvantages of a career change, and help people see the long term potential in a role, or a company.
An executive search professional with experience in the startup ecosystem can be extraordinarily valuable as well. It’s a small world, and the candidates with the technical knowledge, people skills, and startup mindset can be few and far between. Finding an executive search partner with connections at startups, and a talent pipeline with startup executives can provide a great advantage to a company with open senior-level jobs.
Executive Search at Gray Scalable
At Gray Scalable, our executive search practice lives in the space between an internal executive recruiter and a traditional retained search firm. With us, you have access to our start-up network and technical domain expertise, the process of executive search, and the collaboration, transparency and dedication you get from an internal recruiting partner.
We bring unique experience, partnerships and our reputation to the table. The Gray Scalable executive search team has extensive and diverse experience hiring leadership for the world's most disruptive and innovative technology companies, including Buzzfeed, Datadog, Intersection, Opensky, SevenRooms, Olo and more. We take a similar embedded approach to executive search that we do to recruiting: acting as internal partners experienced in the team dynamics of growth companies, we are able to define and attract the right talent for the long term. Our standing in the startup marketplace, combined with our commitment to building long-term relationships, allows us to connect with and attract the very best talent for our clients.
Challenges of Executive Search
No executive search is without its challenges.
Competition
There are a limited number of top candidates for executive positions out there – and you will be in competition with all the other companies that want them. To successfully attract top talent you need a winning strategy – one that combines advertising, messaging, communications, interview process, assessment and offer, and through all of these stages provides the necessary information and suitable incentives to the right candidates.
Diversity and Inclusion
McKinsey research uncovered a clear correlation between gender and diversity among senior leadership: but still, women and minorities are underrepresented among leadership.
Many companies are creating diversity and inclusion policies to remedy this situation. Finding an executive search partner with experience and a talent pipeline that prioritizes diversity and inclusion can be a good first step. The vast majority – 72% - of companies that use an executive search partner require that the short list of final candidates be diverse.
Passive Candidates
According to recent estimates, 79% of global working professionals are passive candidates: those that are currently employed, and not actively searching for a new position. These candidates are difficult to reach through traditional means, like advertising on job boards, because they aren’t out there looking.
Hiring an executive search firm that has an active network, experience with similar candidate pipelines, and credibility with top talent, as well as experience attracting senior level candidates can make all the difference in executive search.
Developing a Multi-channel Search Strategy
To reach executive candidates and to make a good impression on them, it is important to reach out to them on different channels. This may include networking, outreach by email or social – or some combination of contact. In this case, it is extraordinarily helpful to have a prior connection with the candidate to help determine the most effective method of outreach.
Candidate Experience
The process that candidates must go through – from first contact, through interviews and communications, to offer and hire – has a huge effect on how they view your company.
It also impacts whether or not your offer will ultimately be accepted. There is nothing more disheartening than finding a great candidate and going through the whole hiring process, only to have your offer declined at the final step. However, a recent study found that 63% of candidates are more likely to decline an offer after a bad candidate experience.
Finding the Right Search Partner
There are many executive search firms out there – each offering a different level of service, industry expertise, process, skills, and knowledge. Finding the right partner can be difficult if you are uncertain about your process or priorities.
Benefits of the right Executive Search Partner

119,https://www.grayscalable.com/hr-consulting,"HR Consulting
Startups and growth-stage companies need experienced HR (Human Resources) talent to build the foundation for future success. HR consulting can help bridge the gap between where your organization is and where it needs to be.
What is HR Consulting?
Your HR department doesn’t just hire your team: they deliver the strategic direction that attracts the right new employees, build an inclusive and welcoming work environment, support you and your team on a daily basis, and provide the structure, best practices, and training to make sure everyone can contribute to your goals, and move forward on their career paths.
Startups and growth-stage companies often don’t hire an HR team right away, instead devoting resources to creating their product, or building out their platform or service, and finding their audience. But an organization is as strong as the foundation it’s built upon and expert HR advice can help set the stage for future success by building the processes and strategic goals that will drive the company forward long-term.
That’s where HR consulting comes in: clients can hire HR consultants on a short-term basis, to work on specific projects or outcomes; or on a long-term basis, providing a wider range of strategic advice and support.
Who Needs HR Consulting?
Companies of all sizes and stages can benefit from an HR consultant at some point. Early-stage startups can use HR consulting to bridge the gap between when they need ad hoc HR support, and when they’re ready to scale up an HR team. Established companies can often benefit from a fresh perspective or additional expertise in specific areas, particularly when they are in a transitional or growth stage.Signs that You Could Benefit from HR Consulting
- You want to roll out something quickly and don't have the time or expertise
- You know you need to do something, but don't have the in-house knowledge or experience to get started
- You have too many open positions
- You’re undergoing organizational change
- You’re planning a strategy reset and are wondering how to communicate it to staff
- You received financing and are making growth plans
- Your employee engagement seems to be slipping
- Your office, operations, or leadership team is overwhelmed with HR-related questions/work
- You’re seeing an Increase in turnover
- You want to do something right from the start
Benefits of HR Consulting
One of the primary benefits of partnering with an HR consulting firm is accessing the skills of knowledgeable HR leaders and applying their track record of proven success to helping your company set and reach its goals. Not all HR consultants provide the same services; there are specialties within HR and it’s important to find a partner with the specific expertise you need.
Strategy
HR consultants can help a company devise a practical strategy to reach organizational goals. Strategic HR decisions may include:
- Organizational Goals
- Staffing Plan and Prioritization
- Benchmarking and Metrics
- Employee Development
Having expert support to build these strategies from a People perspective can help a company circumvent common pitfalls, and build the foundation for long-term success.
Process
The way that your company does things – the processes that are in place – can have an enormous impact on results. Every process that you put in place is a reflection of the culture, values, and priorities of the company. For example a recruiting process that is built to favor candidates from a specific corporate or educational background may find the candidate pool is skewed away from underrepresented candidates. This hinders diversity, and sends a message to prospective and current employees, and to customers, that an inclusive environment is not a priority.
Communication
HR consultants are People experts, and as such, are skilled at communication. An HR consultant can have a positive impact on company communications, improving transparency and clarity, and strengthening the employer-employee relationship. Engage a consultant to communicate organizational goals and strategies, help employees understand the full value of their compensation and benefits packages, and make company messaging accessible, informative, and enjoyable. An experienced consultant can also act as a coach to your management team, helping to roll out current priorities and building your team’s communications skills for the long term.
Risk Management
Every company must comply with federal and state regulations – from wage and hour guidelines, to benefits, discrimination, and workplace safety. An HR consultant can help create a smart, inclusive handbook, identify important policies to think about, help you think through tricky situations (like terminations and COVID), and advise on communicating compliance updates in a way your staff will understand and embrace.
Focus on Core Competencies
Finally, bringing in strategic HR consultants augments your team so that you can smartly and fully focus on building your business, marketing your product, and securing financing that will help to lead to long-term success.
Qualities of Top HR Consulting Firms
Once you’ve identified a need for HR consulting, how can you choose the right firm for your organization? Consider some of the factors that set top HR consulting firms apart:
Proven Experience
Take the time to understand the experience of the firm as a whole, and the individual consultants that your company will work most closely with. Make sure that the consulting firm has deep experience with companies of your size, in your industry – and that they have measurable results that they can share. This may include referrals, testimonials, or case studies, or simply sharing success stories as a part of the evaluation process.
Functional Expertise
HR consulting can span a lot of different functions, making it critical to understand what your company needs, and ensure that the consulting firm is good at that particular thing. Are you primarily scaling your team, training your managers, managing organizational change, or some combination of these? Set current and future priorities, and look for a partner that excels in those areas.
Data Analytics
There is a misconception among business leaders that HR leadership is a soft skill, that draws on feelings and instinct rather than facts and data. However, data analytics can be applied to improve human resources outcomes as well, including:
- Retention
- Engagement
- Sourcing
- Hiring
- Performance
- Compensation
- Diversity & Pay Equity
Trust
Finally, a strategic HR consultant must act as a true partner to your company. They help set your goals and strategies to reach them, but they also must align their actions to support those goals and strategies. For the term of the engagement, your HR consultant should act as a part of your team, extending your HR expertise and helping build the processes for future success.
For this relationship to work, both parties have to trust one another. Find a consultant whose values match your own, whose integrity is proven, and who you would choose to be a part of your permanent team."

126,https://www.grayscalable.com/startup-recruiting,"Startup Recruiting
Having the right people in key positions can make or break a startup or any fast-growing tech company.
Part of what makes joining a startup so appealing is also what makes it that much more critically important to get right. A startup is all about possibility and vision – and having the right team in place is critical to achieving your startup’s goals. As startups are in their early stages, they generally have fewer employees, so that every new hire will impact the company’s culture and the way the company works – positive or negative.
With so much riding on each hire, it is imperative to have a strong hiring process in place, to evaluate each candidate both thoroughly and fairly. However, just because it is important doesn’t mean that it is easy.
The Harvard Business Review found that 60% of startup failures can be attributed not just to a gap in an employee’s skills and experiences, but to their overall, holistic match for the organization’s needs during a time of rapid growth. To give your startup the best chance for success, it’s crucial to put these strong hiring processes into place early on, so that you’re able to build a great team from the very beginning.
Challenges to Startup Recruiting
So why is startup recruiting so tricky? Startups encounter different recruiting challenges than more established companies. These include:
No Recruiting Team ... Yet
An experienced team of recruiters is often seen as a luxury afforded to larger, more established companies. Startups tend to prioritize hires in engineering or product development first, as those are often the most urgent need.
However, without an experienced team in place, the sourcing, attracting, hiring and retaining of qualified candidates becomes even more complicated. Startup founders and business owners have a number of responsibilities to attend to - and the time-intensive process of recruiting can take attention away from other, equally important aspects of the business.
Reflexive Recruiting
At a startup, structured headcount planning is rarely a strategic move that is planned well in advance - rather, recruiting tends to be opportunistic, and in response to a fast-moving business environment. Because startups are lean and agile, recruiting is focused on answering an immediate need when it is identified as a priority; however, this can lead to a lack of strategic planning and scalable processes for your other hiring needs in the future.
One challenge of this reflexive approach is the lag time between identifying a need and hiring for the position. Especially for candidates with high-demand skills, it can take a long time to find the right person for the job. Building a strategy that identifies a need in advance and takes time-to-hire into consideration is extremely valuable in ensuring timely, high-quality results.
Putting a strong process in place is also critical, especially when a company needs to scale quickly and hire several employees at once. Often, a startup will pass a milestone, such as a round of VC funding, and need to expand their team at short notice. Urgency alone is not enough to make high quality hires in a short period of time; adding a structured process, led by professional recruiters, is a better strategy for success.
Culture Add
Hiring employees that will add to your organization's culture is critically important to employee engagement and business results. You want to hire people who not only support your company’s values, but who also bring alternative viewpoints, new experiences and specialized skills. Instead of focusing on what a candidate doesn’t have, think about what they may bring to the table. It’s extremely helpful here to build a scalable and inclusive process early on versus trying to fix one down the road, especially when it comes to hiring a diverse team and creating an inclusive company culture. As you start growing your team and putting a process into place, keep D&I top of mind, understanding that it starts at the very beginning of the hiring process.
Competition
Finding the right person – with the necessary combination of experience, passion, and skills is difficult, particularly in a competitive environment. Often, startups feel like they have to compete with the tech giants, offering candidates more money and an established brand to attract top talent - but the truth is they can’t compete when it comes to compensation, and they should not try to. Instead, they should look at the creative ways they actually can compete: offering the best benefits, a thoughtful, relaxed culture, modern PTO plans, etc - the things that truly make their startup unique.
Startup Recruiting Strategies
To improve recruiting, startups can apply some key strategies.
Employee referrals
Your employees aren’t only a valuable resource: they can also be your biggest cheerleaders. Establish an employee referral program and use the networks of the people you have, to find the people you need.
Stand out
Working for a startup is a unique opportunity. Make the most of this by advertising your company’s unique culture; on your website, in content or marketing materials, and in your interactions with candidates.
Target talent that can be developed
Experience is valuable – but finding a person who is a good cultural add that can be trained or developed to become the ideal candidate is a great option as well.
Frequently, startups target candidates in the opposite direction, showing a preference for individuals that are overqualified for a given position. This stems from the idea that an overqualified candidate can hit the ground running more easily, requiring less in the way of training and onboarding. However, this can be counterproductive - not only do these candidates require more resources to recruit, they can also disrupt compensation and pay scales and cause friction with other employees.
Developing skills in a promising candidate can be a winning strategy for a startup - allowing you to accelerate the recruiting and hiring process, hire at the appropriate salary range, and create a bond of loyalty with the candidate that can last well beyond the training and onboarding period.
Go where the talent is
Fast-growing tech companies need to draw talent in, using creative methods that can reinforce their brand. One method is to think about where people with the skills you need congregate. This could be a physical meetup, like a career fair or professional mixer or event; or a digital forum. For example, a platform like GitHub facilitates the exchange of ideas among the technical community - and can be a terrific place to source technical talent as well.
Startups need to get creative and go above and beyond with their voices. Many have found great success with social recruiting: using professional platforms, like LinkedIn, or more social sites like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram to locate and connect with candidates. These platforms are not only great tools to find potential candidates, but also to reinforce your company’s values, mission, and brand.

128,https://www.grayscalable.com/technical-recruiting,"Technical Recruiting
Recruiting for any position can be tricky – but technical recruiting brings its own unique challenges.
Embedded recruiting for technical positions can help a startup or growth-stage company create a foundational interview process for scaling while attracting the right software engineers, data scientists, product managers and other technical candidates.
What is technical recruiting?
Technical recruiting is the process of sourcing, screening, and selecting candidates for technical roles, including software engineers, developers, data scientists, data engineers, product managers, product designers, and other related positions.
Challenges of technical recruiting
Technical recruiting can be particularly challenging for several reasons:
Talent shortage
There is a widespread shortage of candidates for technical roles, from software developers, to engineers, to cybersecurity specialists. This shortage has resulted in an increase in competition for qualified candidates among hiring companies, driving salaries higher and extending the time it takes to fill an open position.
Passive candidates
Only 16% of developers[1] are actively looking for a new job, but 60% are interested in hearing about new opportunities. Accessing the best candidates means tapping into this resource, and reaching the people that are not actively looking at job boards and applying to jobs. This requires talented recruiting specialists and a well-designed recruiting process.
Qualified recruiter
It can be just as difficult to hire a top-quality technical recruiter as it is to hire top technology talent. This is because a technical recruiter must excel in several different areas to be effective: communication, organization, creativity and time management – all the aspects of a great recruiter – with the added complexity of technical comprehension, so they are able to speak knowledgeably about technology with the people they are interviewing, and to evaluate technical candidates accurately.
Improving technical recruiting
If your company is currently experiencing difficulty recruiting top technical talent, there are a few areas that can be explored to improve time to hire, offer acceptance rate and quality of candidates – the big three measures of success in technical recruiting.
Job Descriptions
Review the descriptions for all open technology positions, and make sure that the qualifications and requirements are up to date and specific. Analyze job descriptions and determine which skills are essential and which are ‘nice to have’, also which are necessary for a candidate to have from day one, and which can be added through training and development. This will help clarify the picture of the ideal candidate, against which real-life candidates can be measured.
Job Postings
Job postings should be reviewed to make sure that the qualifications are accurate, and also to ensure that postings are unbiased, to promote diversity and inclusion. For technology positions, it can also be helpful to include information about the company’s tech stack: a highly-qualified technology candidate may be intrigued (or put off) by certain elements of the tech stack. Even if the reaction is negative, it’s better to know that from the start than discover it after hours have been invested in interviews and evaluation processes.
Recruiting Technology
Advancements in recruitment technology can help to improve the initial candidate evaluation process, to reduce the time it takes to evaluate resumes and applications and improve the overall quality of candidates that make it to the interview stage. This technology includes applicant tracking systems (ATS), sourcing tools and assessment or testing platforms which can be used to review resumes, screen candidates, help facilitate and track interview tests, and automate communications to candidates to keep them informed and engaged throughout the process.
Recruiter Skills
A top technical recruiter has a combination of recruiting skills, interpersonal and organizational skills, and technology skills. While many recruiters have some of these skills, there are usually areas where one aspect or another can be strengthened and improved. There are many courses and trainings available to improve recruiting and interpersonal skills: but finding the right technical training course may be challenging. Look for one that is targeted to recruiters: specifically to improve recruiter assessment of technical candidates, rather than a course designed to provide people with actual technical skills.
Branding
Creating a strong employer brand is a great way to get top candidates, by making your workplace attractive to your ideal candidates. This involves two steps: one, understanding what appeals to the candidates you want to attract and two, building an employer brand that incorporates these elements.
For instance, are the candidates you want to attract more influenced by corporate social responsibility, compensation, or flexible work schedules? Do they value teamwork over independence? A mission-driven organization, or one with more concrete financial goals? Figure out what your audience is looking for.
Then, ensure that your employer brand emphasizes those things that are most important to potential candidates. Employer brand can be communicated through job postings, through your website and marketing materials, and through your social media posts and interactions.
Embedded Recruiting
Many businesses that are looking to improve recruiting partner with an agency for additional support. This is especially true in technical recruiting, where an agency can bring both the recruiting and technology skills to help improve results. However, a traditional agency has several shortcomings: they are not dedicated to a single client, but instead serve multiple clients at once – possibly including your competitors. Tech recruiting agencies are not aligned with their client goals: their objective is to work with multiple clients to place a candidate and get a commission, which can lead to less than optimal matches and can actually create competition for clients.
The challenges associated with staffing agencies led us to develop our embedded recruiting model – where recruiters are placed at a client’s company and embedded into their HR team, for total alignment with their culture and their goals. Embedded recruiting is an ideal solution for tech startups and growth-stage companies that need to scale their recruiting processes for fast results and engage top technical talent."

Charlie and the team swooped in to get my company’s HR house in order, and ended up building our company policies and handbook from the ground up—in the process, creating what can only be described as a work of art. And our company culture will forever be better because of it.
Adam Lisagor
Founder
Darla Horn and her team at Gray Scalable are exceptional. We initially engaged them for product and technology leadership roles (VP of Engineering, Product Director, Head of QA, and Director of Product Design), and extended it to additional roles in design and technology as they became strategic partners in recruiting top talent. They also set a very high standard for selection processes which was transformative for our team.
Ale Thome
Chief Product Officer
The values we developed with Gray Scalable are still smack in the middle of everything we do. Our company culture, recruiting, training, performance reviews etc are all centered around the same principles that we developed when we were a tiny company - and we are now over 230 people!
Jeff Glass
CEO & CoFounder
Gray Scalable delivered a tremendous amount of value and insight. Charlie was an invaluable partner as we reconsidered the design of our compensation program, thinking through different models and helping build the case for the proposed changes for our senior management team. He brought deep market knowledge about what other companies are doing and how different roles and levels are compensated in the market. They helped on a tactical level, building a flexible and user friendly excel tool that we can use to inform comp decisions going forward.
Katie Childers
VP of People
Chris at Gray Scalable was a tremendous partner to me. He delivered strong HRBP support to the business, helped us take our comp philosophy and job leveling work through all our teams globally, and taught my team and me so much along the way. I don't know what we would have done without his partnership. It was a pleasure working with all of the GS team and the customized approach was incredibly valuable. We look forward to reaching out for support on future projects.
Jacqueline Meyer
Chief People Officer
Rose is really all about candidate experience. She genuinely cares about finding the right opportunities for people and takes the time to personalize the recruiting process for each candidate. She also knew the right times to reach out to our team about giving feedback to candidates, sensitive declines, working through stickier situations with hiring managers, or logistics for offers and closing. I really appreciated her close communication but also knew I could totally trust her in her decision making. Overall it was a pleasure working with her!
Katie Keohane

Charlie and his team combine strategy born of experience and wisdom into action. His promise is in the name - name his work helps make businesses scalable, Gray Scalable is like a turbocharger and gets real results for developing businesses.
David Bell
Former CEO, Interpublic
Deb did a great, fast job helping us hire for our sales team. She was professional and expert in all her work, and I had several candidates independently comment to me that Deb was excellent to work with.
Daniel Chait
CEO
Working with Gray Scalable evolved our people strategy, and brought crucial knowledge to our executive leadership team. The Gray Scalable team, specifically Charlie Gray and Samantha Feldman, became partners to me and my team, joining us for leadership team meetings, taking the time to understand the needs of our rapidly growing business and helping to analyze our data in detail. Together we created the Compensation Principles and Strategy for our company, which ended up saving us a significant amount of money in our hiring strategy and execution. The exercise we underwent even earned us further engagement from our team across the organization, as they learned about our commitment to making sure our compensation practices were fair and at market. The Gray Scalable team is intelligent, passionate and flexible. I’d work with them again any chance I could get.
Crystal Proenza
Chief Brand and Performance Officer
Rose from the Gray Scalable team exceeded all expectations when it came to supporting me throughout the recruiting and hiring process at mParticle. Her impeccable service was a tremendous amount of help when it came to recruiting, managing the pipeline of candidates, and providing general expertise and best practices on hiring. She took the time to truly understand the hiring profile, how candidates background and skill sets matched against our specific needs, and was supportive through the entire process.
Justin McManus
Head of Solutions Engineering
Katie is a rock star recruiter. I give her my strongest endorsement. We worked together on a number of hard-to-fill ""unicorn"" positions and she delivered on each and every one. With no prior knowledge of Bowery's industry, she helped us to better define several disparate positions. Through creative sourcing and a very high level of engagement with the business, she was able to identify great candidates across the board. Katie also played an instrumental role in selling the candidates on joining our company; her hit rate was 100%.
Darren Thompson
CFO
Gray Scalable has been a huge help to our team as we scaled from 12 employees to over 30. Bec and Elise helped us better utilize our ATS, design our technical interview processes, train our team how to interview, and much more. Most importantly, they made us great technical hires in the last year - half of which were candidates from underrepresented groups in technology. The Gray Scalable team was truly embedded in our culture and as a result felt like part of the team. We'll all miss the team when they roll off and I hope that we get the chance to partner with them again in the future.
Kurt Schrader
Co-Founder and CEO
We are very happy with the result of the engagement and feel we have put a great team in place to support our needs. Gray Scalable's commitment to understanding our culture and brand has resulted in an amazing group of people coming on board with us. We appreciate all of the expert insight, guidance, and patience provided during the process, and especially the 100% acceptance rate!
Adam Weinstock
CTO
Truly a fantastic experience working with Lauren and the Gray Scalable team. The expertise and professionalism of each member of the team were readily apparent and much appreciated. Not only did we get a bunch of fantastic hires, we learned a ton and walked away with a structured process to move forward with. I can't say enough good things! Thank you all so much for getting our growth off to such a strong start.
Matt Morris
VP of Engineering
I had a fantastic experience working with Eric Tenety at Gray Scalable on an executive-level search. From beginning to end, Eric and the team went above and beyond to communicate clearly, to learn and adapt based on my feedback and to move quickly to closing the best candidate. They exceeded my expectations at every stage, and I would highly recommend them to anyone.
Fiona Spruill
Chief Operating Officer
Jennie and I worked together to fill multiple senior roles on my sales team at Reddit, and I cannot speak highly enough of my experience working with her. Jennie is professional, communicative, pro-active and an all around pleasure to work with. She listens, absorbs feedback on candidates, and applies those learnings as she continues her search. Jennie also worked with me during a difficult time personally and she was extremely supportive and flexible - working around my schedule and communicating whenever and however was best for me. A big thank you to Jennie and the rest of the Gray Scalable team for all their hard work!
Sarah Miner

Aja is terrific. She hit the ground running and was able to immediately help us tackle some of the most complex HR issues.

They were a helpful bridge before we had a people team, and they're now a great complement to our growing team when we need specific expertise. Their recruiters have all been amazing and Sam Feldman, their Analyst, was a really exceptional thought partner for our comp structuring and analysis.

Charlie and his team at Gray Scalable have been an invaluable resource for us. As Vimeo took the plunge into developing a structured interview process, Charlie partnered with us every step of the way from beginning to end: he is a strategist, a teacher, a thought-partner, and a project manager who is incredibly sensitive and insightful when it comes to company culture, training, and new initiatives. We were so successful with the new interview process that we asked Charlie to help us with some broader initiatives pertaining to compensation, leveling, and management training- all of which have taken our ability to attract and retain top talent to a new level.

I’ve had the pleasure of working with Deb on several searches for sales talent. Not only is Deb an expert in sourcing top sales talent, but she excels in identifying the right culture matches and has been very patient with a company and team that are very selective in who they bring into the company. She goes beyond the blocking and tacking of recruiting and builds relationships, with hiring managers and talent. As someone with a lot on his plate beyond staffing, I’ve relied heavily on Deb to manage my participation in the recruitment process and to counsel me along the way. She is a trusted advisor and I could not meet my aggressive staffing goals without her help. It has been a real pleasure working with Deb!

Darla and her team helped us re-set our tech recruiting process from end to end, including market assessment, interview processes, and skills requirements. Our engineering leadership called their talent pipeline ""the best talent we've seen"" and have been able to fill and onboard multiple key senior roles in just a few months. They've partnered with us to build and transition to our new internal recruiting team as well; It's been the transformative partnership we hoped for - they have my highest recommendation.

VP Global People
Emily is hands down the absolute best tech recruiter I have ever worked with. She has incredible empathy for how people think, she knows how to listen and is fantastic at pushing back in helping me articulate my own thinking around recruiting. She has also helped us establish a structured engineering interview process that we'll be able to scale as Spring grows. I would hire Emily 110% tomorrow if I could. I don't have enough good things to say about her!

Foursquare has been lucky to have Charlie as a consultant to help guide us through the constant people challenges of a rapidly growing organization, ranging from evolving management structures, career development, title laddering, calibrating compensation with the market, and more. Charlie has served as an excellent outside adviser, drawing on his extensive experience in tech companies big and small, to offer us smart, insightful, actionable advice that effectively balances leading industry HR practices with specific cultural considerations.

I have worked with Charlie Gray and Deb Feldman for 10 years. As CEO at ShareThis I have used them to provide strategy on our HR processes as well as hiring a number of key employees - at many levels of our organization. Charlie and Deb know how to scale HR functions and find the right people for fast growing organizations. They are super responsive and able to drive results. I couldn't recommend them enough!
Kurt Abrahamson
CEO
Deb is one of the most responsive and reliable recruiters I have ever worked with. Deb is not just looking to put bodies at clients. She is a relationship builder who is very careful to make sure she puts the right person in the right company. Deb will also stay active in your engagement and will always take the time to speak with you. I had nothing but positive experiences with Deb. She rocks!
Ryan Holly
Account Executive
Charlie was a phenomenal source of wisdom for our team. There's an enormous library of public knowledge on culture, compensation, and other people policies that can be hard to fit into your organization. Hiring an expert like Charlie will take the mystery and confusion out of it as he listens patiently and filters through the noise to help you lay an HR foundation that will last. Couldn't give a stronger recommendation.
Jay Desai
Co-Founder and CEO
When it came time to revamp our compensation structure to better align with industry standards, for a company of our stage and progress, we sought out Charlie’s team to provide us with expertise, market data and recommendations. Charlie and his A+ team understood the market and applied their expertise to quickly deliver a clear compensation structure that has been rolled out company-wide. They took our input and goals, worked within our specific complexities and constraints, and incorporated all of that into the model. The result has enabled a more transparent, consistent overall compensation structure and process for applying reviews to compensation, while maintaining the right performance incentives, and making our hiring more competitive in the market. They delivered not only expertise and judgment, but also user-friendly tools for our use in managing the new structure going forward. As important as the tools and deliverables, Charlie and team provided terrific support and guidance to help us gain buy in across our leadership team, as well as to communicate the changes more broadly to all employees in a clear and effective manner. I really could not recommend Charlie any more strongly for a project of this type."
