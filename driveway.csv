Here are some actionable ways to make your remote employee training and new hire onboarding processes more effective.
4 min read
·
April 22, 2022
It is estimated that 16% of companies worldwide are now 100% remote. Most hiring managers also believe that having teams with remote workers will be the new norm. In addition, we will see more than 4 million Gen-Z'ers entering the hybrid workforce that is ready to embrace new ways of working.
So how can you create a standardized process to train new employees? Before we dive into actionable ways to make your onboarding process more effective for new hires, let's answer a few of the most common questions about remote employee training and new hire onboarding.
How is remote onboarding and employee training different than in person?
The risks of remote onboarding are obvious for employees who are shyer or less curious. The number one piece of advice for remote onboarding is to try and design something that works for everyone. It's much easier to tell if someone is uncomfortable or confused during your onboarding and training if it happens in person. Remote onboarding and training mean employers need to be more proactive in checking in on how learning is going.
How long does it take to onboard a new employee who is remote?
Gitlab reports it takes about two-weeks to onboarding a remote employee. We highly recommend checking out their guide to remote work.
These are just the bare essentials of getting an employee ready to do their job. In terms of getting your new hire fully productive, it's commonly recommended to have a 30-60-90 plan with individual goals at each of these key benchmarks. If you do go this approach, don't forget to schedule check-in's, or incorporate a review of 30-60-90 goals into your 1:1.
1. Encourage an open line of communication
Apps like Slack, Cisco Webex Messaging, Google Chat, and RocketChat could help foster an open line of communication. For example, with Slack, you can create team and group-focused channels with other employees. In addition, in remote environments, messaging apps facilitate communication and collaboration better than email messages.
2. Create interactive onboarding workflows
Onboarding at a new job can be overwhelming, with a lot of knowledge being shared and transferred. As a result, it’s potentially easy to let some information fall through the cracks, slowing down the ramp-up period. To prevent this, hiring managers can create interactive, standardized guides that new hires can go through at their own pace. With Driveway, employers can ramp up new hires quicker with interactive virtual onboarding how-to guides. In addition to guided product walkthroughs, you can copy to Notion and Google Docs and create interactive guides for any web app.
3. Create a progress tracker
Progress trackers are an excellent way to keep new hires motivated and excited about their position. Google sheets or platforms like Trello, Asana, and Monday, which build creative to-do lists, allow new hires to recognize their incremental progress. Progress trackers also help employees discern long and short-term projects while developing a portfolio from the work they have completed at a company. Lastly, remember that employee onboarding doesn't stop after their first two-weeks or 90 days. Continue to look for opportunities to upskill and cross-train your team
.
4. Consider a success roadmap
Success roadmaps are another great way to keep new hires aware of their expected workload and prioritize responsibilities. Platforms like Lattice are a great way to set goals and expectations and map out career development for long-term growth. Programs like Notion allow for new projects to be displayed and explained. You can group tasks by status, observe project assignees, and view deadlines for specific projects.
5. Embrace a new way of working
COVID-19 has forever changed the workforce, and employers need to recognize the new way of working. Between fully remote, hybrid, and in-person work options, it is essential to clearly define your company's expectations of how your employees show up to the office. Now with Microsoft Teams and Zoom plus other remote video conferencing platforms, employees can connect with you from anywhere. It's more important than ever that companies are investing in best practices and best tools for knowledge-sharing
to make up for the reduced communication in a remote environment.
6. Encourage taking regular breaks and some time off
Working long hours can take a toll on an employee’s mental and physical well-being. Therefore, employers need to promote a healthy work-life balance, especially with new hires. Encourage your employees, especially new hires to take regular breaks. Also, share the protocol for taking time off from work and promote your PTO policy as one of your company’s perks.
7. Make scheduling accessible
While the ability to work from remote locations can be a luxury, aggregating employees amidst virtual meeting schedules can become complicated. With meeting addresses changing from room numbers to links, it can be easy to confuse the virtual location or scheduling with others if dealing with different time zones. Take advantage of Google Calendar and keep your calendar accessible to your teammates, especially new hires to simplify scheduling meetings.
8. Set them up with the right WFH environment
Most hybrid and remote first companies now offer a work-from-home stipend. This allows employees to be equipped with everything necessary to succeed. This is particularly important for new hires to be set up to do their best work.
9. Check-in
It is essential to regularly check in with new hires in their first few weeks. Platforms like Hibob can help note employee development. Plan check-in meetings that allow new hires to highlight their progress, ask questions and share their feedback. Recognize accomplishments via shoutouts in group messages or larger meetings to boost motivation and a sense of belonging for all employees.
10. Keep it fun
The future of work is shifting in a direction where new hires look for purposeful jobs at companies with a fun work environment. Unique and positive company culture is now essential to hiring and retaining great talent. Consider adding Giphy to your Slack, after-work trivia nights, virtual get-togethers, and team bonding activities
. Attempt to utilize the benefits of collaboration tools within your virtual workspace to build camaraderie among employees."
2,https://driveway.app/blog/3-upselling-and-cross-selling-tips-to-improve-your-saas-sales-process,"3 Upselling and Cross Selling Tips you can Learn from Target
1. Cross Selling via Product PlacementUpon entering any Target store, one of the first sections you will encounter is the “$5 and under” section. More often than not, customers are willing to stop by this section just to see what cool and new items are available. Because everything in this area is low-cost, it is easy to throw a couple of $3 items in your basket and keep it going.
While digital products do not have a physical storefront, you’ve seen similar experiences virtually with pop-ups or banners. Good product placement puts the product directly in front of your customers when they are in a buying mood. For SaaS Sales teams, this means sharing your latest product updates or company press on LinkedIn, Twitter, or over email.
2. Upselling via F.O.M.O.The fear of missing out, abbreviated as F.O.M.O., can be used as an upselling tactic to appeal to your customer’s emotional buying patterns.
When Target places items on sale, they say “Limited Availability” or “Clearance and can do so as quickly as two weeks after merchandise is released. Labeling it this aggressively communicated the necessity to buy this now because it might not be here later.
Creating a language that appeals to a customer’s F.O.M.O. is key to upselling digital products. Words like “upgrade today” create a sense of urgency, meaning customers are more drawn into making a purchase.
In SaaS Sales, upselling via F.O.M.O. can be accomplished by offering your customers an incentive if they upgrade in a time window or sign before an expiration date. By including an additional feature or digital item, you make it harder to resist their fear of missing out on a one-time offer."
3,https://driveway.app/blog/best-crm-solutions,"What is a CRM?
Customer relationship management (often referred to as CRM) is essential to building successful companies and creating opportunities for your company to grow. CRM technology manages customer experience and helps with your growth team’s goals. When deciding what CRM technology to use for your company, it is essential to understand the different types of CRMs. Let's dive in!
Different types of CRMs
CRM software falls into three categories: collaborative, operational, and analytical, each serving a unique purpose based on your company's need. Collaborative CRMs allow for customer service information to be neatly accessed by various company divisions. Collaborative CRMs aggregate relevant customer information and facilitate your employees' shared knowledge of user experience. Interaction management and channel management are the key aspects of collaborative CRMs. Channel management deals with the marketing and interacting strategies your company enacts to appease customers. In contrast, interaction management deals with any employee or customer interaction, whether transactional or experiential. With collaborative CRMs, past and present customer information can be accessed company-wide to better understand a customer's needs and provide more accurate goals for all employees working together. Do I need a collaborative CRM?
If your business is customer-centric, then a collaborative CRM is beneficial. For example, a company with many customer-facing subdivisions (customer service, tech support, marketing division, etc.) can collectively utilize a collaborative CRM to create a better customer experience. Operational CRMs aid in a customer's streamlined experience with your company. Automated systems like call venters, lead sorting, and instant chat features are helpful. They eliminate tedious tasks that encumber employees. With a shared interface and organized automation, operational CRMs prove beneficial for day-to-day tasks.
Do I need an operational CRM?
Operational CRMS are great for companies that perform many sales functions. The CRM's automated features help get guide customers from start to purchase and can continue to support your customer network with service features. Software like SalesForce is an operational CRM that helps build customer relationships and provides an efficient experience for those interacting with your company's services. Analytical CRMs are digital tools that help your company collect, organize, and analyze data about your company. Large quantities of data can be challenging to navigate, but analytical CRMs take away the stress of this essential function. Analytical CRMs utilize company data at a greater capacity with trend analysis, financial reporting, sales forecasting, etc. Analytical CRMs are vital for cultivating critical projections and using your company's valuable information. Do I need an Analytical CRM? For a company that thrives on consumer trends and preferences, analytical CRMs is the way to go. Such CRMs will help you aggregate and enforce a large amount of valuable data that could ultimately lead to increased sales, fewer customer complaints, and a more profitable business.
Top CRM tools that are most common across companies of all sizes:
1. Salesforce
2. Zoho CRM
3. Bitrix24
4. Pipedrive
5. Nimble
6. Hubspot
The good news is that Driveway overlays on top of all of the leading CRMs, which makes it easy for your team to create how-to-guides with ease to get everyone up and running, and trained on how to best use them!"

- About: Health tech, 1,000+ employees, onboarding a large operations team
- Before: Inconsistent, manual onboarding across Greenhouse & Salesforce
- After: Consistent up-to-date training docs automatically sent to new hires
Elemy is a tech-forward provider of Pediatric Behavioral Therapy. After their Series A, they needed to invest in their onboarding process for remote employees.
""Every time someone signed an offer letter, there was a ton we had to do to get them ready to start their job."" said Hassan Yasin, Director of Product and Strategy.
""We had so many new people joining and a process that was so manual, that most people didn't bother updating onboarding documentation.""
Over the next 18 months, the Elemy team would grow from 8 to 1,100 people.
""Now, not only can we use Driveway's Chrome Extension to write training documents for us, but those guides are automatically assigned once a candidate is hired in Greenhouse, and their guides are automatically shared on day one. Driveway is saving us literally dozens of hours a week in administrative work."""

12,https://driveway.app/blog/getting-started-with-notion,"Getting Started with Notion
Notion is a productivity tool that helps remote, hybrid, and in-person companies revolutionize their workflow. Notion can help organize team projects, track progress and promote productivity. Here are some tips to help navigate Notion and better your working experience.
How-to: Download to Desktop
Notion has download capabilities for Windows and Mac. Once Notion is downloaded, enter your company email and password or create a new account.
How-to: Navigate the Basics
1. Creating a page
Each page on Notion acts as a blank canvas that can mold to whatever your need may be. Create pages for meeting notes, blog posts, team tasks, checklists, plus many more possibilities and features.
To create a new page, click + New Page
in the bottom left-hand corner of your desktop. Notion allows users to pick their page type to fit their content. Next, just pick a fitting page title, and your work is complete!
Once a new page is created, it will live on the left-hand toolbar with the rest of the pages that have been created.
2. Editing and Writing Basics
Notion is a dynamic platform that allows for headers, text, bullets, quotes, images, and videos to help build an idea or convey a message.
Once on a new page, start typing to fill the space with text. To format the text, highlight what you have written. Formatting options include:
- Text
- Heading 1
- Heading 2
- Heading 3
- Page
- To-do List
- Bulleted List
- Number List
- Toggle List
- Code
- Quote
- Callout
You can also select Comment
to make suggestions on text; if you want to attract a specific collaborator, use the @
symbol and their name within the comment. You can also link through text and change the text color to customize your page.
To affect the format of an entire page, click the three-dot icon in the top right corner of your screen. Here you can change page width, favorite a page, or delete the page.
How-to: Master the Sidebar
1. Navigating with the Sidebar
Notion’s sidebar can be found on the left-hand side of your screen. The sidebar holds essential functions like Quick Find
, Settings, Members
, plus all the pages you are a part of.
Click on your current workspace name in the sidebar and switch profiles to the workspace you desire to change workspaces. This allows you to toggle between separate ventures quickly.
All Updates
is another feature that belongs in Notion’s sidebar. Check out this tab for new information on pages you follow, essential reminders, or when you have been mentioned within the workspace by fellow collaborators.
Sick of the sidebar? You can permanently close the sidebar by clicking the grey arrow in the tab’s top right-hand corner (or click “Command \”
on Mac or “Control \” on Windows, to give yourself more viewing room while working.
Notion will categorize pages by Shared
, Private,
and Workspace when in a shared account
. Pages located in the Workspace
tab are visible to everyone, While invited members can only access Shared
, and Private
is available to your eyes only.Pages located in “private” can always be added to “shared” by adding invitees in the shared settings, which looks like this.
Import Button
Head over to the Import button on the sidebar to import information from other applications like Evernote, Trello, Asana, Google Docs, etc. The import feature allows for continuity of information between Notion and other platforms.
How-to: Access Shortcuts
Block Options
When on a page, type the “/” (the backslash symbol) to unlock the full menu of block options. You can choose from the scrolling menu or type the format after the backslash to transform the block option.
Galleries and Tables
When it is time to create a database, a Notion user can again type the backslash key (/) and use the scrolling menu to insert the table or gallery or any other database they want to include.
Here is an example of what an inline gallery database added to a page in Notion might look like.
Drag and Drop
Click the six dot icon next to a content block to rearrange items on a page. Next, drag content around the page until it lands in your preferred location. Finally, create columns by dragging two blocks next to each other on the page. Notion also provides users with blue guiding lines to help with spacing when dragging content blocks.
Quick Find
Sometimes it can be hard to sift through pages full of content to find the specific information you are looking for; with Quick Find,
this task is more accessible. To access Quick Find,
head to the top left corner of your toolbar or use “Command P” for Mac or “Control P” for Windows.
Once the search bar appears, type in the keywords associated with the content you're looking for, and Notion will generate a list of search results with their page locations.
When dealing with a large amount of data, try using the filter icon under the search bar to refine content by Titles
, Best Matches
, Created/Last Edited Date,
or page creator to ensure you find what you need.
Favoriting Pages
If you find yourself searching for the same page repeatedly, utilize the Favorited button in the top right corner of a page. A favorited page will then appear under the Favorites tab in the toolbar for easier access in the future."

15,https://driveway.app/blog/how-to-automate-your-growth-marketing-funnel,"Automation is an integral part of any Growth Marketing strategy because it allows you to reach more people with a system that works 24/7 without spending as much time on it yourself.
In this article, we'll show you how to automate four critical responsibilities of Growth Marketers:
- Email Marketing
- Social Media
- Lead Generation
- Content Creation
Before diving into how to automate your Growth Marketing funnel, let's start by defining Growth Marketing.
What is Growth Marketing?
Growth marketing is a strategic approach to marketing that helps businesses grow their revenue and customer base by optimizing their funnel. It's about finding new customers, identifying their wants, and delivering value through a consistent experience.
The process of systematically acquiring and nurturing these customers is highly iterative and involves testing different strategies and tactics to find the ones that work best. Growth marketers use data science and technology to understand their customers, then use that insight to drive growth at scale.
What is Growth Marketing responsible for?
Growth Marketers are often responsible for identifying new leads, converting them into customers, retaining them, and increasing each customer's lifetime value.
Growth Marketing is about finding new customers, converting them into paying customers and then getting them to spread the word about your business. It's a full-stack process that involves SEO, PPC, email marketing, content marketing, and even influencer marketing.
Growth Marketing vs. Performance Marketing
Performance marketing works differently than Growth Marketing — it's exclusively focused on converting existing website visitors into paying customers. Performance Marketers decide what metrics are essential (e.g., leads vs. conversions) and why they matter (e.g., because leads are top of the funnel, they're less likely to convert).
Growth Marketers don't need to be PPC or SEM experts, but they need an understanding of how those channels work to measure their effectiveness against other growth channels like SEO or email campaigns.
Growth Marketing vs. Demand Generation
Growth marketing is similar to demand generation in that both focus on driving traffic and leads through content marketing, advertising campaigns, and other outbound strategies. However, demand generation focuses on generating interest in a product or service and getting people through the first stage of your sales funnel. In contrast, growth marketing focuses on getting users through all funnel stages.
How to automate email marketing
An email is an excellent tool for connecting with potential or existing customers. However, constant email traffic can be time-consuming and distract from more critical conversations. Email automation troubleshoots your email clutter by sending out emails at regular intervals to those in your network. Have an exciting announcement or update? Your nifty email automation system sends news to customers in real time. Deem your business more reliably through the help of email automation that sends customizable messages at a rapid pace. For a streamlined communication experience, head to services like Outreach, Hubspot
, Salesforce,
and Drift
for all your email automation needs, or check out our blog post on the best CRM solutions for your organization.
How to automate social media marketing
With such a low barrier of entry, if you're not using social media automation, you're leaving money on the table. But juggling a posting schedule for your business's multiple accounts can get overwhelming. Lucky for you, social media automation services are easy to set up for posting new content to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, Google+, and Tumblr. Use tools like Hootsuite
, Buffer,
and Sprout Social
to schedule posts across multiple platforms. Upload your pre-made post and choose the time, day, and account you want your content featured. Consistent social media posts will keep your company relevant in followers' eyes and reinforce your brand image
.
How to automate lead generation
Chasing down leads can take time away from present customers. Don't let your sales team become discouraged by a customer's wild goose chase. Instead, troubleshoot your manual client search with lead generation automation that locates prospects and provides contact information for direct marketing from your end. By funneling leads and data to your business, sales teams have more time to close deals rather than search for them. ZoomInfo
is a helpful lead generation platform that helps you identify companies that are a good fit for your service or product. Also, check out Salesforce
and Hubspot
for more lead-generation tools.
How to automate content creation
Content creation is an essential part of automating your marketing funnel. It's not enough to post content; you need to ensure that your content is relevant, engaging, and helpful. Creating original content that people find beneficial goes a long way with brand reputation and recognition. Content creation platforms save you hours designing and planning your subsequent marketing campaigns. Popular services include Canva,
which offers free, professionally designed templates with customizable features. Similarly, Trello
offers thousands of templates and formatting dimensions for various social media platforms."
16,https://driveway.app/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-salesforce-edition-for-your-business,"How to Choose the Right Salesforce Edition for Your Business
If you’re considering using Salesforce for your business, you may be wondering which edition is right for you. With several different editions to choose from, it can be a daunting task to decide which one fits your business needs. In this post, we’ll provide an overview of the different editions of Salesforce and help you choose the right one for your business.
Overview of Salesforce Editions.
Salesforce is a cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software that helps businesses manage their customer interactions and data. Salesforce offers a variety of editions, each with different features and pricing plans.
Here are the main Salesforce editions:
Salesforce Essentials: This is the most basic and affordable edition designed for small businesses with up to 10 users. It includes basic CRM features like lead and opportunity management, email integration, and customizable dashboards.
Salesforce Professional: This edition is designed for growing small businesses with up to 50 users. It includes more advanced features like forecasting, customizable reports, and collaboration tools.
Salesforce Enterprise: This edition is designed for larger businesses with up to 500 users. It includes even more advanced features like workflow automation, approval processes, and advanced reporting and analytics.
Salesforce Unlimited: This edition is designed for large enterprises with unlimited users. It includes all the features of the Enterprise edition, plus some additional features like unlimited custom apps and 24/7 support.
Factors to Consider When Choosing a Salesforce Edition.
When choosing a Salesforce edition, there are several factors you should consider.
These include:
Business Size: The size of your business is an important factor to consider when choosing a Salesforce edition. If you’re a small business with only a few employees, the Salesforce Essentials edition might be the best fit for your needs. On the other hand, if you’re a large enterprise with hundreds of employees, the Salesforce Unlimited edition might be a better choice.
Number of Users: The number of users you have is also an important factor to consider. If you only have a few users, the Salesforce Essentials or Professional edition may be enough for your needs. However, if you have a large team, the Enterprise or Unlimited edition may be more appropriate.
Budget: The cost of the different Salesforce editions is also an important factor to consider. The Essentials edition is the most affordable, while the Unlimited edition is the most expensive. Be sure to choose an edition that fits within your budget.
Business Needs: Consider the specific needs of your business. Do you need more advanced reporting and analytics? Do you need workflow automation? Do you need unlimited custom apps? Consider which features are most important to your business and choose an edition that includes those features.
Choosing the right edition.
Now that you know what to consider when choosing a Salesforce edition, here’s how to make your decision:
Evaluate your business needs: Consider the factors discussed above and evaluate your business needs. Make a list of the features you need and the number of users you have.
Compare editions: Look at the features and pricing of each edition and compare them to your business needs. Use a comparison chart to make it easier to compare.
Sign up for a free trial: Once you’ve narrowed down your options, sign up for a free trial of the editions you’re considering. This will give you a chance to test out the features and see which edition is the best fit for your business.
Upgrade or downgrade as needed: If you find that the edition you’ve chosen isn’t the right fit for your business, you can always upgrade or downgrade to a different edition. Salesforce makes it easy to make changes to your subscription.
Conclusion
In summary, choosing the right Salesforce edition for your business requires careful consideration of your business size, number of users, budget, and specific needs.
By taking the time to evaluate these factors, comparing editions, and testing out different options, you can choose an edition that will help you manage your customer interactions and data more efficiently, and ultimately grow your business.

If you're someone who loves to stay organized and get things done, you've probably heard of Notion – a powerful productivity tool that helps you keep track of all your tasks, notes, and projects in one place.
One of the most useful features of Notion is the ability to create sub-tasks, which allow you to break down a larger task into smaller, more manageable chunks. In this blog post, we'll explore the benefits of using sub-tasks in Notion and provide some tips on how to effectively use them to boost your productivity.
What is a sub task?
Sub-tasks in Notion are essentially smaller tasks that are nested within a larger task. For example, let's say you have a task called ""Write blog post."" You could create sub-tasks for this task such as ""Outline post,"" ""Write introduction,"" ""Write body,"" and ""Write conclusion."" By breaking down your larger task into smaller sub-tasks, you can better track your progress and stay focused on what needs to be done.
How do I create a sub task?
To do this you’ll want to do the following;
1. Click on the … menu in the top right of the database, and select Sub-items.
2. In the Sub-items window, you’ll create a self-relating property. You can rename the properties to “Sub-tasks” and “Parent tasks”.
3. Select Create.
Here are a few tips for effectively using sub-tasks in Notion:
1. Be specific: Make sure your sub-tasks are specific and actionable. For example, rather than creating a sub-task called ""Research,"" create a sub-task called ""Research top 10 productivity tools.""
2. Keep it simple: Don't create too many sub-tasks for a single task. Aim for a balance between being specific and not overwhelming yourself with too many items on your to-do list.
3. Use checkboxes: Use checkboxes to mark off sub-tasks as you complete them. This can help you stay motivated and track your progress.
Here are a few tips for effectively using sub-tasks in Notion:
Conclusion
Sub-tasks are a useful feature in Notion that can help you stay organized, focused, and on track. By breaking down large tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks, you can better manage your time and stay motivated to get things done. Whether you're working on a personal project or a professional one, using sub-tasks in Notion can help you boost your productivity and achieve your goals.

20,https://driveway.app/blog/how-to-foster-a-culture-of-knowledge-sharing,"Knowledge sharing is used throughout the workforce as a shared network of accessible information. While this business buzzword may seem self-explanatory, facilitating knowledge sharing within a company can be tricky. Here are some ways to encourage knowledge sharing within your company and amongst teams.
1. Knowledge sharing creates a sense of belonging.
Knowledge sharing promotes a sense of belonging for those in your company. With an organizational structure that allows everyone to be heard, ideas will be more diverse, allowing more effective solutions to shine through. Encourage more introverted employees to share their opinions and facilitate opportunities for everyone to share their best ideas. Employees feel valued in their position when they contribute to changes, which translates to more passionate work.
Take action
Institute a suggestion box, have a weekly New Ideas meeting, and engage in after-work dinners or one-one coffee chats with employees. Take advantage of communication platforms like Slack and create open forum channels that allow free-flowing thoughts or ideas to stimulate inspiration among your employees.
2. Knowledge sharing facilitates best work practices.
Everyday work functions should not have to feel like a puzzle, and knowledge sharing can help employees maintain a clearer sense of projects and role responsibilities. Knowledge sharing also provides transparency on a company's values and expectations for the team to embody. When employees have the proper tools and direction, their success will skyrocket.
Take action
The proper onboarding process is vital to facilitate best practices. Teach new employees the basics of everyday work functions and clarify the responsibilities. Outline your company's fairness and social justice practices, so employees see you hold them in the highest regard. Finally, utilize platforms like Driveway that allow a more straightforward onboarding process through customizable guides for commonly used remote working software.
3. Knowledge sharing allows for more customer understanding.
Customers are the best resource when improving or expanding your company's operations. Communication with customers allows employees to aid the company's overall success by pivoting individual work efforts. Allow customer preferences to be easily accessible within your company. As employees work as a team, knowledge sharing on customer insights will aid in effective company growth.
Take action
Create Google Forms to gain customer feedback and share insights with employees. Build a shared Google Sheet that outlines customer concerns, compliments, or recommendations. Encourage communication among departments to better understand customer needs from all facets of your company.
4. Knowledge sharing transforms half-baked ideas.
Accommodate free-flowing creativity and encourage employees to think of imaginative projects and innovative solutions. Provide platforms that allow for creativity and teamwork. Ideas often need a joint effort to transcend past half-baked, and collaboration can reshape partly done projects into final products.
Take Action
Have weekly brainstorming sessions to stimulate creativity among your team. Use platforms like Figma that provide employees with a synergistic interface for building projects and creating goals. Institute a Slack channel, Google Folder, or Notion page that accommodates unfinished projects and encourages combined employee effort.
5. Knowledge sharing helps employees retain information.
Turnover is inevitable; however, knowledge sharing can also aid in the turnover of information for an employee stepping into a new position. New team members may be frustrated when trying to solve a problem or think of an idea without the proper tools or instructions. Viewing a predecessor's current projects and comprehending a role's nuances can help a role's successor settle their responsibilities more efficiently.
Take Action
The use of progress trackers can help employees pick up where others left off. With Driveway, employees can have a smoother ramp-up process using how-to guides from previous team members that cater to their specific roles. New hires will retain more information during their onboarding process with practical support and a thorough understanding of their new position.
6. Knowledge sharing creates comfortability with collaborative tools.
In the hybrid and remote work environment, collaborative tools are critical to a company's everyday functions and communication. Employees should be encouraged to use and build comfort with sharing tools. Instituting knowledge-sharing practices helps to speed up this process.
Take Action
With Driveway, employees can make how-to guides on commonly used software Like Slack, Hubspot, Notion, and many more that provide guides on standard collaboration tools. Driveway will also work with your company to build principles based on your employees' needs for a fully customizable experience that ensures the best knowledge-sharing experience."

22,https://driveway.app/blog/how-to-set-up-an-email-sequence-in-hubspot-for-saas-sales-prospecting,"What is a Hubspot Workflow vs Hubspot Sequence?
The short answer is Sequences are for Sales and Workflows are for Marketing.Hubspot gives you different abilities depending on whether or not you are sending Sales Emails or Marketing Emails.Specifically, you won’t be able to automatically trigger Cold Sales Emails, or start a Sequence for a contact, in an automated way.
Instead, you’ll have to add a contact to a List so that they are enrolled in a Sequence (more on that later).You might be thinking - why not do a Workflow then? It’s a good question - you could use Workflows to send Sales Emails like a Sequence - but in order to use either feature, you still need licenses to Marketing Professional and Sales Hub respectively.
The best answer I can give on when to use a Sequence instead of a Workflow for Sales Emails is when you want to compare results across multiple versions. The Sequences homepage has a new “Analyze” tab that lets you see results for open rate, click-through rate, and reply rate across all your Sequences.
For that reason, I like to think of my Workflow as an automated email campaign every user goes through, and I like to think of Sequences as an automated email campaign some groups of users go through sometimes.
How to make a sequence in Hubspot
This walkthrough will help you find Hubspot's template for a ""Prospecting"" email campaign. This email campaign is best suited for contacts who have recently become sales qualified and are ready to be contacted. After this guide, we'll show you how to create an ""Active List"" that lets you add these contacts to
How to make an active list vs a static list in Hubspot
This walkthrough will show you how to make an ""Active"" list in Hubspot. The difference between an Active list and a Static list is that an Active list will be dynamically updated. This means that as contacts meet the criteria they'll be enrolled in this sequence. For example, this walkthrough will enroll a contact into this sequence if it is marked as a sales qualified lead after today."
23,https://driveway.app/blog/how-to-turn-employee-training-into-cross-training,"What is Cross Training vs Employee Training?
According to MindTools.com
, Cross-training is the practice of training your people to work in several different roles or to do tasks outside their typical responsibilities.
A great example is training someone from your Customer Support Team some best practices in SaaS Sales & Customer Success Management - like how to upsell or cross sell.
Unlike Employee Training, these roles or skills are typically not mentioned in job descriptions or included in performance reviews. The ambiguous responsibilities in a cross-trained organization make managers and People teams less likely to adopt these practices despite the clear business advantages.
Keep an eye out for these red flags. If you spot at least two, it might be worth considering rolling out a formal cross-training program with one of the tools below:
1 - Business functions halt when a team member is out of the office or on vacation.
2 - Difficulty in teamwork on highly specialized or cross-functional projects.
3 - Limited employee skill sets prevent traditional career development opportunities.
4 - Inability to reach company goals consistently across departments.
Typically a company's most significant concern with cross-training is the amount of perceived time it will take to train employees successfully.
Companies already spend enough time and money onboarding employees that the fear of more training can sound expensive.

If you're reading this, you may be wondering, can I merge duplicate contacts in Hubspot? The answer is yes, you can merge contacts in Hubspot, and it's a great way to keep information in one place. No matter what - at some point, you'll have the same contact on multiple properties.
For example, let's say that you have a lead who signed up for your newsletter but also downloaded an ebook. In this post, we'll walk through how to stay organized and efficient by merging Hubspot contacts. If you don't want to read all this text, you can check out our Driveway guide at the end.
How you can merge duplicate contacts in Hubspot
Search for the contact you want to merge
The first step of merging contacts is finding the contact you want to merge.
1. Click on My Contacts
2. You can search by name or email address. You can also search by company name and/or job title if your contact has a more complicated name.
3. Click ""Actions"" in the top left, then click ""Merge"".
Enter the email address of the contact you're merging with
If you're not sure which email address belongs to the contact you want to merge, no problem. You can use HubSpot's search feature to find it.
1. Go into your contacts list and type in one or two characters of the contact's name as well as their company name if applicable.
2. You will now see a list of all emails associated with that person. This is where we'll look for our mystery email!
Press Merge Contacts
The merge contacts button can be found at the bottom of the contact details page.
1. Click the Merge Contact Button
2. Now, HubSpot will take you through a series of questions to determine what data should be merged into a single contact. For example, if you're merging customers from two different companies or vendors, Hubspot will ask if they should have separate customer profiles.
3. Complete all your inputs
4. Press Merge Contacts and wait for it to finish merging your contacts into one master customer profile

27,https://driveway.app/blog/how-to-use-notion-api-examples-and-integrations,"Notion API gives users the ability to automate their workflow by integrating Notion to desktop applications like Google Suite, Slack, Dropbox and many more. Before jumping into some of our favorite integrations and examples of using Notion's API, let's start with the basics.
What is an API?
An API is a tool used to sync and update information from one app to another - almost like a door. Common productivity tools lack the functionality to directly connect with each other, but API's sync information across platforms.
Why is Notion's API such a big deal?
Notion users had been begging Notion for an API for years. Why though?Lets say you're running all your weekly planning out of Notion, but you use Google Calendar.
It can be a bummer to switch between tabs and windows to see everything you need (or even worse, having to update a separate calendar in Notion.
Not anymore! With Notion's API, you can sync Notion content directly into your Google Calendar
. Say goodbye to hitting copy and paste!
What are the different ways to integrate Notion into the tools I'm using?
Now that we understand APIs and why Notion's is such a big deal, let's talk about how to set up your integrations.
There are two main ways to set up integrations with Notion.
1. Code it yourself
You can create a customized automation from scratch using a coding language like Python. If you do, you'll have to be mindful of their rate limit, which is 3 requests per second.
2. Use a no-code tool
You can also build integrations yourself using a no-code assistant like Zapier of Automate.io. Here are some examples of how you can use Zapier to connect Notion to a bunch of different tools
- including Google Tasks, Slack, and Microsoft Outlook.
How to find your Notion token and set up a no-code integration with Zapier
Ready to integrate?
With no-code translators like Zapier and Automate.io, building integrations takes less time and brain power.
Remember that internal integrations are workspace specific and users must be an admin to complete the function. For a more organized new year, try an internal integration on your personal workpace to start off.
Here’s how to integrate with Zapier:
1. Start in Notion and navigate to the left side bar and click the Settings and members
tab, then the Integrations
tab
2. At the bottom of your screen click, Develop your own integrations
3. The My Integrations
page will open in your browser, once there click +New Integration
4. Next, insert a Name
specific to your integration and choose the Associated workspace
connected to the integration. When working with an API Translator we like to name our integrations “Zapier → [insert workspace name]
5. ”Upload an image for your integration under Logo
6. To see your new integration, toggle back to the Settings and member
s tab in your workspace
7. Click My integrations
to see your new integration
8. To retrieve your integration token, click the three dots next to your internal integration. This token is essential to link workspaces with outside platforms and for all API automations created by your team in this teamspace.
9. Now head to Zapier’s website,
here you will be promoted to authenticate the two apps you want to connect. We picked a Slack notification for each time we add a page to our ""Meeting Notes"" document.
10. Choose a Trigger
on Notion like “Create a New DataBase” which will launch a specified reaction in Slack.
11. This specified reaction will be chosen as an Action
in Slack like “
Send Channel Message”
12. While building your new automation, Zapier will ask for an API Key. Insert the unique token we created in Notion, as this will identify the workspace for Zapier.
13. Then you will publish your Zap to complete your new automation.
14. Once your Zap is published, ever-time you create a new Database in Notion a Slack message will be sent!
What are examples of the most popular Notion integrations?
When organizing your new year, get creative with your API integrations. As you sync information across platforms, watch your workflow transform for 2023.
Here are a few of our favorite integrations that ensure more efficiency and organization in the new year. Gmail
Do you run your own business? Or receive so many emails that it feels like you do? Either way, when integrating Notion with Gmail you can set up an automatic response systems to keep track of your demanding inbox. Or create and send emails through Notion, keeping you in one workspace! HubSpot CRM
Sync databases between HubSpot and Notion to keep track of customer updates. Parallel new databases from one platform to another with ease and avoid the risk of incongruent information.LinkedIn
An active LinkedIn presence keeps your community informed on exciting business updates and news! With Notion’s API technology, an update in Notion databases can trigger LinkedIn status updates, building a strong social media presence without the effort!

29,https://driveway.app/blog/how-to-use-notion-create-a-teamspace,"This means assignments, schedules and documents can be controlled in one area instead of scattered across different applications without rhyme or reason. The best part is that Notion makes it easy for everyone on your team to access a teamspace, no matter where they are or what device they use. Sounds like something your organization needs? We thought so. Here's how you can create a Teamspace in Notion:
How to create a Teamspace in Notion
While the organizational upsides of teamspaces may be obvious, remember that teamspaces also give employees a canvas to express their thoughts and ideas.
1. Navigate to your sidebar and click All Teamspaces, then press new teamspace.
2. Give it a name. This name will appear at the top of your screen while working in this space, so make sure it's meaningful and easy to remember!
3. Add team members who will be part of this project (if you haven't already added them), or invite new people if necessary. Before joining your teamspaces, team members must have their own Notion account.
How to make a dashboard for your Teamspace
1. Create a database of your team's tasks
While building your team's workspace, first create an efficient task management system. Achieve this in Notion by creating a database where you and your team can add tasks and files related to the project.
- To get started, go to the menu bar at the top of the page.
- Then type /database and a list of database layouts will appear. For tasks, we suggest selecting Board View
- Then click an existing page to insert to your database or click New Database
- Once your board is created, you can create new tasks, assign team members to tasks and update the progress of your tasks
2. Create a database for documents and files.
Documents and files are easily disheveled so create a database so important information never gets lost or disorganized again! To create a database for documents and files:
- Again, type /database and select the format you would like to use. We recommend List View as it creates a list of pages that can act as folders for documents and files.
- Upload an existing database or create a new one
- Name your database
- Name your pages and start filling them with documents and files
- Now you have a new database for your dashboard!
3. Link your database to your dashboard
Now that your databases are made, it's time to build your dashboard. To do this type /linkedviewofdatabase and select your desired databases. Now your database information will appear. Here we linked a board view database for TikTok content ideas!
4. Share your Teamspace
Once you've created your Teamspace, you can share it with other users by inviting them to the Teamspace.
To do this, go to the Settings tab in Notion (this is the gear icon located on your home screen) and then click Invite team members.
The next window will show all of your colleagues who already use Notion and don't have any shared spaces yet. You'll also see a ""Suggested people"" section where we've displayed names of contacts that might be good candidates for joining this Teamspace. Here are other ways to invite members to the Teamspace:
- Share a link to the Teamspace with people outside of Notion.
- Share a link to a specific dashboard within your Teamspace.
- Share a link to a specific database within your Teamspace.
Now, watch as your seamless Teamspace transforms productivity and workflow for your team, and check out our blog for more tips and tricks to streamline your Notion experience."
30,https://driveway.app/blog/how-to-use-notion-links-backlinks-and-synced-block-indexes,"Links are integral to Notion's design and functionality, but many users need clarification on how they work.
They're not just decorative; they're functional. In fact, if you use indexes and synced blocks correctly, links and backlinks can form the foundation of a good workspace organization.
This guide will explain everything you need to know about using links, backlinks, indexes, and synced blocks to organize your Notion.
How to organize Notion with links
Notion has a number of different ways to link information together to make information easier to organize.
Linking to other websites in your Notion pages is helpful when referencing analytics, social media posts, or anything else that can't live only in your Notion.
Notion automatically creates links whenever you add a new subpage to a page.
But you can also create something called a backlink - a backlink is the same as a regular link, with one key difference: it points to any page or subpage in your Notion.
Unlike linking to any normal website, ""backlinks"" let you see on any page all the different pages it is linked to.
This means that I can link any text on any Notion page to any other Notion page - and anyone viewing that page will see all the places where this information is linked to.
This blog post will cover:
- How to link from Notion to another website
- How to link from one Notion page to another Notion page
- How to create an index of backlinks and synced blocks in Notion
How to link from Notion to another website
You can follow the interactive walkthrough above or read our full article here.
How to create a link or backlink from one Notion page to another
Since Notion can be used as a shared workspace, linking between pages helps users to navigate through each other's content that they maybe wouldn't find otherwise.

How to create an index of backlinks and synced blocks in Notion
Looking for a way to organize big blocks of content in your Notion workspace?
Let's say every month you have a blog post that is your ""Content of the month.""
It's the same piece of content, but it's needs to be accessed by Sales and Marketing, and they have two different team pages.
Now imagine this problem across a bunch of pieces of content both teams need to access.
Create an index of synced blocks that organizes your pages that need to be shared into tags or topics and syncs them together.
This index of tags or topics will help your Notion collaborators navigate through a large amount of content with greater ease.

31,https://driveway.app/blog/introducing-driveway,"I wouldn’t be writing this if someone hadn’t taken a chance on me early in my career.
My big break into product management came about a year into my first startup job. I might have only been helping a small team ship an update to an internal tool, but the opportunity to learn new skills at work helped me find my passion and grow with the company.
We all have moments that shape our careers. Maybe yours was learning how to handle a tricky sales objection or pulling up a chair to shadow an experienced teammate. These moments are learning and development in action, helping us advance our knowledge and adapt to change. And in the remote-first future of work, these qualities are only becoming more important.
But while the rise of remote work has unlocked new opportunities for companies and their employees, it has also created new challenges for learning and development. Today, 85% of knowledge workers aren’t satisfied with their employers’ support of their careers, and 60% say they’ve had fewer opportunities for workplace learning since the start of the pandemic.
That's why we're building Driveway. We're reimagining learning and development for the way knowledge work is done today. Our vision is a world where everyone has the guidance they need to realize their full potential at work—from their first week of onboarding and beyond.
What’s holding remote teams back?
Over the past year, we’ve worked with dozens of remote and hybrid teams and interviewed hundreds more. We found that they all struggled to adapt their learning and development practices because of three key problems:
Creating training content is time-consuming. Asynchronous communication is critical for remote work, but teams rarely have the time to write and maintain training material. As a result, process docs go out of date even faster than code is shipped to production.
Accessing relevant training is hard for employees. Teams still rely on presentations, messy shared drives, and clunky LMS tools to deliver employee training. These old methods make learning impersonal, inaccessible, and difficult to put into practice.
Employee progress isn't recognized or rewarded. Learning something new should be celebrated, but proficiency is hard to measure in a remote environment. And when learning achievements are disconnected from career goals, employees become disengaged.
Solving things the Driveway… way
Driveway solves these problems by putting people before content. With Driveway, learning and development are designed for the unique needs of remote teams. Not the other way around."

- About: Food tech, Hybrid workforce, 10 employees, hiring Account Executive
- Before: Rachael, CEO, spending time writing how-to guides in Notion
- After: Driveway writes how-to guides for her, Rachael exports them to Notion
Opus is a training platform for front-line workers. Rachael Nemeth, their CEO, didn’t go from front-line restaurant worker to building a restaurant tech company, it took a sharp mind and a ton of hard work.
That doesn’t mean that onboarding her first employees was easy though.
“Jeff joined as my technical co-founder, so he onboarded our first few engineers. When I hired my first sales person, I felt like I had to download my entire brain.”
Rachael had written some step-by-step guides in Notion for how to use Outreach, ZoomInfo, and Hubspot - but she also needed to be selling.
""I didn't want to hand off out-of-date process docs, or make her sit with me in a meeting all day, but I just didn't have the time.""
Then, Rachael got Driveway. Now she can automatically write a step-by-step guide just by doing her process. Once she's done, she exports it to Notion and shares it with her team.
“As a CEO of an early-stage company, saving time is essential - I love that Driveway takes what used to take hours of my and turns it into minutes.""
Rachael and Carly added to-do’s and comments to Carly’s guides as her onboarding went on, giving them a template for their next sales hire.
“Driveway has made onboarding our rapidly growing team easy while keeping the experience personal for each new employee. Our team loves it and I sleep better knowing that we’re gaining efficiency as we expand.”"

35,https://driveway.app/blog/project-management-tools-to-plan-your-salesforce-rollout,"Best Project Management Tools to Plan your Salesforce Rollout
Salesforce is a powerful CRM platform that has become increasingly popular among organizations of all sizes. However, implementing and rolling out Salesforce can be a complex project that requires careful planning, coordination, and execution. In this guide, we will explore some of the project management tools that can be used when rolling out Salesforce, and which one you should pick depending on your rollout strategy.
Asana - Best for collaboration
Asana
is a project management software that can be used to manage a Salesforce rollout project effectively. Asana enables project managers to create and assign tasks to team members, set deadlines, and monitor progress. Since Asana is user-friendly, easy-to-use, and offers a free plan, we recommend Asana for any rollouts where you don't have an existing project management tool but know you'll need to collaborate on your rollout.
With Asana, project managers can also collaborate with their team members, share files, and communicate in real-time. Asana provides project managers with a centralized platform to manage their Salesforce rollout project and ensure that it is completed on time and within budget.
Jira - Best for complex rollouts
Jira
is a project management software that is particularly useful for managing complex projects such as Salesforce rollouts. Jira enables project managers to break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks, and track their progress using agile methodologies.
Jira is considered an industry-standard for Enterprises due to its robust feature-set and security preferences. The amount of features Jira has could be overkill for a startup, but if you're managing a complex rollout that requires documentation as well, consider Jira and it's companion knowledge base product, Confluence.
Jira provides project managers with features such as task management, reporting, and real-time collaboration, making it easier to manage a large team of developers, administrators, and other stakeholders. Jira is a popular choice for organizations that follow agile methodologies and require a flexible and scalable project management solution.
Trello - Easiest to Use
Trello
is a visual project management software that can be used to manage a Salesforce rollout project effectively. Trello enables project managers to create boards, lists, and cards to track the progress of their project.
Trello, unlike Jira, is notoriously simple in format - just a kanban board
with cards. Trello is so fun and easy-to-use that Atlassian, the marker of Jira, acquired them in 2017
. If you like keeping things simple and want to keep your rollout simple too, Trello is the tool for you.
Trello also provides features such as checklists, due dates, and attachments, making it easier to manage tasks and collaborate with team members. Trello is a great choice for organizations that prefer a simple and intuitive project management software solution.
Work.com - Best Salesforce Integration
Salesforce's Work.com is a software solution designed specifically for managing Salesforce rollout projects.
Work.com provides project managers with features such as task management, real-time reporting, and collaboration tools, making it easier to manage a Salesforce rollout project. Work.com also provides project managers with access to a range of resources and best practices for Salesforce rollout, ensuring that the project is completed successfully.
These tools enable project managers to communicate with team members in real-time, making it easier to resolve any issues that may arise. They also provide features such as video conferencing, screen sharing, and instant messaging, which can be helpful when working remotely or with geographically dispersed teams.
Conclusion
Rolling out Salesforce can be a challenging project, but project managers can increase their chances of success by using the right project management tools. What's important is picking the right project management tool for your rollout goals.
Gantt charts, project management software, communication tools, and data migration tools are just some of the tools that can help project managers streamline their project management process and ensure a successful Salesforce rollout.
By leveraging these tools, project managers can stay on top of their project and deliver a high-quality Salesforce implementation that meets the organization's needs. Implementing these tools can help project managers achieve success in their Salesforce rollout project and improve their overall project management process.

36,https://driveway.app/blog/quicks-ways-to-build-an-online-presence,"While social profiles can be fun for personal use, more and more business profiles have built a valuable professional network. Your company's social media can highlight your services and grow your brand image. Find your company's signature style and watch your followers grow.
Here are some basic rules...
Don't:
- Display unoriginal content (without recognition).
- Clog your followers' feeds with multiple daily posts.
- Use dated social media trends.
- Over-edit or over-filter photos.
- Post Inappropriate or personal photos.
- Advertise non-factual content.
Do:
- Download formatting apps for concise posts (Canva).
- Download apps that help plan future posts (Hoot Suite).
- Actively produce content and interact with other accounts.
- Utilize story, tag, and re-share features.
- Find your account's unique style and run with it!
When using social media, these ""Dos"" and ""Dont’s"" should always be kept in mind. However, certain platforms require more specific tips and tricks to create a strong following and build a successful account for your company. When making multiple social media profiles, it is essential to maintain a brand story and brand image. A brand story is an excellent way for clients to understand what motivates your company's mission. Share the origin story behind your company and your ever-growing progress. Include personal style in your brand image that reflects the clients you attract and the types of employees that make your company successful. Keep your brand image consistent across your multiple social media accounts. Let's explore popular social platforms and how to display your company effectively on these specific profiles.
Instagram
A successful Instagram starts with an accessible account. When creating a profile, choose a clear and concise profile username with few numbers or characters. Make your company's Instagram public in the profile's settings and specify your profile as a business account. A business account allows you to see 'insights"" or statistics on the viewership your content receives. By making your account public, anyone can view your content and see what your business is all about. Instagram stories, which can be viewed on your profile for 24 hours, show exciting day-to-day events or re-shared posts from other profiles. Encourage employees and clients to follow your account to gain a larger audience for your company content. Incorporate employee shout-out posts or promote company events to keep content engaging for all followers. Instagram's Professional Account suite is also great for helping you find ways to widen your reach with new audiences, ads manager through Facebook Business Manager, and for promoted posts.
Twitter
Twitter is an easy and low-lift way to get in the conversation and engage with your customers and followers. Many brands and businesses use the platform to launch and promote new products and services. Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft also use the platform to resolve customer support issues. In addition, brands make derivative accounts to improve customer experience across their product offerings. One of the few limitations of this platform is that you’re limited to 240 characters per tweet, but you can create threaded tweets to create semi-long-form posts.
LinkedIn
Unlike Instagram and TikTok, LinkedIn is a professional social network. LinkedIn provides users with a feed of relevant content from those in their network.

- Before: Inconsistent, manual onboarding across Greenhouse & Salesforce
- After: Consistent up-to-date training docs automatically sent to new hires
Elemy is a tech-forward provider of Pediatric Behavioral Therapy. After their Series A, they needed to invest in their onboarding process for remote employees.
""Every time someone signed an offer letter, there was a ton we had to do to get them ready to start their job."" said Hassan Yasin, Director of Product and Strategy.
""We had so many new people joining and a process that was so manual, that most people didn't bother updating onboarding documentation.""
Over the next 18 months, the Elemy team would grow from 8 to 1,100 people.
""Now, not only can we use Driveway's Chrome Extension to write training documents for us, but those guides are automatically assigned once a candidate is hired in Greenhouse, and their guides are automatically shared on day one. Driveway is saving us literally dozens of hours a week in administrative work."""

- About: Private equity & venture capital research reports, 4 employees
- Before: Walter was on-call anytime someone wanted to update the CMS
- After: Any member of the Sacra team can access up-to-date how-to guides
Sacra isn’t Walter Chen’s first rodeo. As a three-time founder, he knows that the first rule of startups is anything that can do wrong will go wrong.
When Walter was building the early founding team at Sacra, he knew that good knowledge sharing was going to be key, and that his team would need to embrace new ways of working.
“When I started Sacra, we had huge “bus factor”, meaning if one person was out things could grind to a halt. We spent a lot of time on knowledge sharing.”
One of the most important parts of Sacra’s tech stack is its Content Management System. As a media company, Sacra’s business line depends not only on high-quality content but also on delivering that content to its users reliably.
“Someone would accidentally change a parameter and the whole blog post would break. If you hadn’t set up the system it was really hard to know what was wrong with it.”
That’s why Walter started making how-to guides using Driveway. As a busy CEO, he needed a tool that wasn’t just good at sharing information, but also good at capturing it really quickly.
""With Driveway’s Chrome Extension, I just click a button, do my process, and I have my document. It has screenshots, descriptions of what I click, even any keystrokes I type. It's one of my favorite tools for remote team collaboration.”
Walter chooses to export his Driveway guides to Notion, where the team keeps their knowledge base, for easy knowledge sharing when needed.
“Our CMS releases lots of features - now it’s really easy to update the screenshots now. With Driveway, I know my team is going to have the up-to-date process documentation they need to do their job, no matter what comes up.”"

42,https://driveway.app/blog/six-tips-to-help-engage-customers-on-new-features,"Six Tips to Drive Customer Adoption of New Features
Putting time and resources into a new feature is half the work; showcasing your update to customers and attracting potential clients is the ultimate goal.
Often, companies fail to gain momentum after a feature is released while customers struggle to adapt to the changes you've introduced. To make the most of your new feature, here are six techniques to keep your customers engaged with product updates.
1. Announce on Social Media
Social media is a quick and easy way to announce your company's newest features. Instagram's platform is a great starting point; the app provides stories, reels, and feed post options for various ways to highlight your latest update.
On your company's profile, curate posts highlighting your latest update. An Instagram reel or TikTok video can capture the function of your new feature in real-time, showing followers the intended way to navigate product changes. TikTok's ""For You Page"" delivers users personalized content, giving your video an opportunity to reach potential clients who need your service.
Attract visitors directly to your website by taking to Twitter for announcements with links to your product update and website. Retweeting is a great way to highlight media outlets and current customers that are talking about your update. To strengthen your social media network, suggest employees reshare company posts on their accounts and participate in your post's comment section to answer any follower questions that might arise.
2. Update your Website/ Blog
Your new feature is valuable to your company's service and customer experience. On your business's website or blog page, create original content highlighting your update. Existing users often feel overwhelmed when they lack familiarity with a new feature. Including a ""New Feature How-to Guide"" within your post will provide transparency for users and help them adjust to product changes.
Images are processed 60,000 times faster than text in the human brain; by displaying step-by-step screenshots of your new feature, users will understand all aspects of your update at a faster retention rate.
Through revamped SEO and social media content, new features will drive traffic to your website, but without proper site promotion, your company could miss out on potential clients.
Announce new features on your homepage through banners or pop-up screens. Create a natural flow for website visitors that bridges the gap between engaging with your content and using your feature. Ease users into your update by linking website announcements to blog posts that empower visitors to engage with your service.
3. Email your customers
Don't let a new feature go unnoticed - even if it means writing an email to your customers directly. Instead, communicate exciting new features with clients via email.
Personalize your email to the strengths of your new feature and list ways your update can improve your client's experience.
To stir immediate interest, link new feature blog content and social media posts. Create opportunities for customers to engage with your new feature by including your How-To Guide or linking information to customer support.
4. Notify Employees Via Messaging Platforms
Open communication is critical for troubleshooting concerns a new feature may bring. While email is great for sending mass announcements, utilize internal messaging platforms like Slack to communicate with employees about a new feature quickly.
Provide employees with guides on how to navigate a new feature or answer recurring questions from customers. To promote an update to clients, employees need to learn a new feature rather quickly. Create messaging channels where employees can ask questions and receive support from their coworkers. Message employees new feature training guides before the update publicly launches and remain mindful of employee concerns as they navigate product changes.
5. Send Out A Press Release
With more extensive product updates, consider a press release to enhance the visibility of your update. A press release informs platforms, like blogs, newspapers, and magazines, of newsworthy product improvements they believe readers will want to hear about.
A positive review of your product's update can enhance the legitimacy of your service since these news sources are often trusted by readers finding out about you for the first time.
Collaborate with journalists specializing in product updates and new features to increase credibility with the public about your company's growth. These company spotlights from outside media platforms can drive high-intent traffic to your website and increase conversion as qualified and interested readers learn about your service.
6. Create a Training Guide/ Meet With Users
More significant feature updates can often seem overwhelming for clients. Consider meeting with users during a training session and field customer questions as you run through new features.
For your team, try a Chrome extension software, like Driveway, that automatically creates edits and shares interactive how-to guides in seconds for a streamlined new feature launch.
Users can revisit customizable walkthroughs for a streamlined knowledge-sharing experience. Training guides also help employees and clients familiarize themselves with updates and empower more productive work.

43,https://driveway.app/blog/the-ultimate-customer-success-training-course-for-saas-startups,"What is Customer Success Management?
Customer Success at a SaaS company is all about getting customers up and running quickly with the in’s and out’s of your product.In order to accomplish this goal, Customer Success Management teams need to be excellent at skills used across functions like upselling
, feature rollout
, and CRM expertise
.
Based on conversations with dozens of SaaS companies, we've identified the four key skills that Customer Success Management teams need to keep customers successful.
Skill #1: Keeping calm and being supportive
It's a fact - to succeed as a startup, you must provide support to your customers.
It's also a fact that some of the work can be stressful - like answering their questions and responding to their feedback.
Instead, view the support aspect of your work as making sure customers are in the know about product changes. This also means making sure your product team is in the know on how your customers are feeling.
These changes can be communicated via email, info sessions, interactive walkthroughs - whatever works for you and your customers - just make sure it's consistent.
Yes - this means your team needs to provide support after onboarding too.
Try using a survey after onboarding so you know where you need to invest your time and attention. You can then compare your survey data on onboarding success over time.
Skill #2: Building trust with customers
Build trust with customers and create value by being responsive to the needs of new users. The best way to do this is to adopt a “One Team, One Dream” mentality - yes, this means your support team AND your new users are working together as a team to execute a positive onboarding process.
Remember - your company's onboarding and training processes will reflect on your company and your product. Be sure to take the time to establish an open line of communication between new users and your onboarding team to avoid any dropped balls.
Proactive communication from your onboarding team also helps customers become more comfortable expressing areas of improvement. Consider regular check-ins with new customers to revisit concerns they may have had earlier to avoid them becoming larger frustrations later if unattended.
In user onboarding, there will always be areas of improvement in your new user experience, and that there will always be some confusion with some users.
What's most important for establishing trust with your customers, is once you found the gaps, is to help your teams learn and adopt smoother and more customer-centric processes going forward.
When onboarding, don't fall into the trap of setting your expectations too high. If you've onboarded a lot of customers, you might feel confident in your training program. However, it helps to remain receptive to users' needs and flexible when changing your product's features or functionality.
Establish milestones with your new users to avoid an overwhelming training process, and take extra time with customers while teaching essential features of your service.
Often teams are eager to onboard customers as quickly as possible, but don't let training schedules creep ahead of new user understanding. Be sure to create slack in your schedule for unknowns that may come up.It's important the expectations are clear for customers so that it is easy for them to remain engaged and active with all features of your service.
Every new user will enter their training with a different level of knowledge and ability. Customize milestones that match the learning pace of your user to make sure they feel empowered to address their problems.
What defines a great user experience? Think about some of the best products you use today.
Great product experiences start with two things: (1) a clear call to action; and, (2) a simple path to success.
In order to create a clear call to action and a simple path to success, you'll need to make sure whichever team does customer onboarding, Customer Success or otherwise, has clearly defined roles and responsibilities.
If you're not sure where to start in defining your roles and responsibilities, you can begin by asking yourselves these questions: As a user, what's the first thing I need to do when I sign up? As a user, how do I get support when I have an issue? Today, who is responsible for these processes?
To make sure your team can support the experience you've designed, run a capacity planning exercise with your Customer Success Management function. Measure your total capacity for work hours, time how long processes take, and estimate using data how often you expect this process to happen.
If your ideal user experience can't happen in the product today, there are tons of free SaaS tools and browser-based extensions
to help you design the best user experience possible.
When onboarding new users, consider tools for making walkthroughs to help facilitate positive new user experiences by removing friction around finding new features. You can learn more here
about how Driveway is helping Customer Success teams train their customers using simple, fast, and easy walkthroughs."
44,https://driveway.app/blog/welcome-new-hires-and-build-camaraderie,"Ice breakers and employee bonding, whether in a remote or in-person environment, provide an excellent opportunity for co-workers to learn more about each other. Employee camaraderie builds valuable connections within your company and boosts morale. With a positive work-life experience, employees can become more productive and purposeful in their roles.
Get to Know Each Other Ice Breakers
When thinking about the right ice breaker to use, it is important to consider the preexisting relationships that employees have with each other. For new hires, ice breakers that allow others to get to know each other with personal details and fun facts can facilitate personal discussions later.
Life Highlights
Step One: Ask employees to close their eyes for a minute and visualize the best moments of their lives. These moments can be any happy memory and do not need to be related to their profession.
Step Two: Keeping their eyes closed, ask each participant to take a moment to decide what 30 seconds of their life they would want to relive if they only had thirty seconds left. THEN ask participants to narrow it down to the best 5 seconds of their life.
Step Three: The leader of the activity will ask every participant what their 30 seconds entailed and why they chose it, which will allow participants to get a feel for each other’s passions, loves, and personalities.
Whodunit
Step One: Have everyone in the group text you a random/funny/interesting fact about themselves and their name.
Step Two: Pick a couple of the facts and read them to the group without revealing how they apply.
Step Three: Have the group guess who the fact applies to and why they think that. After a couple of guesses, reveal the person and have them explain the story behind their fact (if any).
Find 10 Things in Common
Step One: Break everyone into separate groups, including employees from all departments.
Step Two: Task the groups with finding ten things that all of them share in common (besides the obvious, e.g., that they are human).
18 & Under
Step One: Give everyone 20-30 seconds to think about something cool, fun, or impressive they accomplished before they were 18.
Step Two: Simply go around the room, and ask each person to share one accomplishment they had before they turned 18.
Energizer Ice Breakers
Perhaps it's been a long work day, or you are trying to boost morale before the meeting. Energizers can be fast and effective for lifting employees' spirits and getting the whole room laughing.
Human Machine
Step One: Gather your employees and have them stand in a large circle. Explain that the group's task is to build a human-machine, and each person will become one moving part of the machine.
Step Two: One employee enters the circle and begins making a repeating sound and a physical movement (e.g., a “beep, beep, beep” sound while waving one arm.) After 5 seconds, another person enters the circle and connects to the first person, making a unique sound and a movement. Continue building the machine until everyone is connected, making a sound and movement until you have a myriad of chaos.
The Movie Pitch
Step One: Split into groups and have each group think of two movies to combine into one plot. Then, after 10 minutes, have each group summarize the plot of their mashup. Here are some movie ideas
- Wizard of OZ and Jaws
- Harry Potter and Titanic
- Jurassic Park and the NoteBook
- Frozen and Spiderman
Beatboxing
Step Two: Have one team member start making a noise you’d hear in a song like percussion.
Step Three: Have everyone in the group go around the circle until you make an orchestra of sound.
The Handshake
Step One: Divide your employees into two pairs and have them make the most creative handshake in about two minutes.
Step Two: Have the pairs present the handshake to the rest of your employees.
Step Three: If time allows, make new pairs and repeat the process with new partners. Now employees have a handshake they can use with each other throughout the workday.
*Facilitating Techniques
When facilitating appropriate and effective ice breakers and team activities, keeping some critical techniques in mind is essential.
Things to do…
- Create a low-threat atmosphere
- Keep the group focused and on task
- Gauge the reactions of participants
- Be engaged in the conversation
- Maintain the flow of conversation
- Learn and use participants' names
- Be energetic and enthusiastic about the activity
- Consider redirection for ineffective activities
Things NOT to do….
- Make fun of participants
- Use inappropriate humor
- Ignore what an employee has said
- Act disengaged and aloof
- Make generalizations or assumptions
- Provide unsolicited advice"

Virtual Instructor Led Training (VILT) is a modern approach to employee training that is gaining popularity in today’s workplaces.
With the rise of remote work and the need for accessible and cost-effective training solutions, VILT offers a flexible and engaging option for organizations looking to upskill their employees.
In this blog post, we’ll explore what VILT is, the advantages it offers, and best practices for delivering effective VILT.
The basics of Virtual Instructor Led Training
At its core, VILT is a live, instructor-led training experience that takes place in a virtual environment. Unlike traditional classroom training, VILT utilizes technology to connect trainers and learners across geographical locations.

One of the benefits of VILT is its accessibility. With VILT, learners can participate from any location with an internet connection, making it a flexible and cost-effective training solution. Additionally, VILT allows organizations to reach a global audience and to scale their training programs to meet the needs of a growing workforce.

Furthermore, VILT can be customized to meet the specific needs of learners, allowing organizations to provide targeted training that addresses skill gaps and business needs.Another advantage of VILT is its scalability. As organizations grow and expand, VILT can accommodate a larger workforce without the need for additional physical training facilities. This can result in significant cost savings for organizations.
For learners, VILT offers a more engaging and interactive training experience. With features such as chat rooms, breakout sessions, and interactive polls, VILT can foster a sense of community and collaboration that may be lacking in traditional classroom settings.
Tips for delivering effective Virtual Instructor Led Training
To ensure that VILT is effective, trainers must be skilled in engaging learners in a virtual environment. Some best practices for delivering effective VILT include using interactive tools, fostering discussion and collaboration, and monitoring learner engagement.
Trainers should also be mindful of the virtual classroom environment, such as ensuring proper lighting and sound quality.Learners can also take steps to maximize their VILT experience. Some tips include minimizing distractions, participating actively in discussions, and utilizing interactive features to stay engaged.
Finally, organizations considering implementing VILT should take a strategic approach. This may involve assessing the needs of their workforce, developing targeted training programs, and selecting the appropriate technology and software to support VILT.
Conclusion:
Virtual Instructor Led Training is a flexible and engaging training solution that offers numerous benefits for organizations and learners alike. By utilizing technology to connect trainers and learners across locations, VILT can provide targeted, customized training that meets the needs of a growing workforce.
To deliver effective VILT, trainers should employ best practices for engaging learners in a virtual environment, while learners can take steps to maximize their experience. With the right strategy in place, VILT can be a valuable addition to any organization’s training program.
