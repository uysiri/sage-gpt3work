Defense ensuring Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability for Your Philadelphia Company
From processing payments and conducting interoffice communication to storing sensitive information and coordinating logistics – your electronic infrastructure is essential for your company’s core functions. Even with all of the benefits that technology provides your business, reliance on it positions your organization just one instance of malware, infected email or other cyber-attack away from major disruptions in business continuity, costly legal action or worse. Considering all that’s at stake, choosing the IT company who you partner with for you cyber security should be done with care. When local businesses need the best cyber security company in Philadelphia, they rely on our team at WC3 to keep them protected.
Every business is unique. Don’t waste your time or money with an IT company that only provides one-size-fits-all solutions. With WC3 as your IT services provider, you can expect personalized cyber security solutions. We start by consulting directly with you and carefully examining your existing infrastructure. From there, we can design and implement the ideal cyber security customized to your organization. Your cyber security plan can include advanced endpoint protection and updates, secure monitoring, remote monitoring and management, data loss prevention, dark web monitoring and more. Our support team is available 24x7x365 if an emergency need should ever arise. This full-service approach has helped position us as the best cyber security company in Philadelphia.
Reaching and maintaining regulatory compliance is central to our overall cyber security strategy for your business. When you partner with our team at WC3, you will enjoy total peace of mind in the knowledge that your sensitive customer, employee, patient and other sensitive data is safe from unauthorized access. Strict adherence to best practice techniques ensures that your operation is on the right side of the law. Our methods meet and often exceed the requirements outlined by HIPAA, Sarbanes-Oxley and all other applicable legislation. We attribute our reputation as the best cyber security company in Philadelphia, in-part, to our meticulous attention to detail and passionate dedication to your business’ success.
These headlines are clear, ransomware, phishing, and other types of cyberattacks are increasing in number and sophistication. No business is too small, and the fact is that cybercriminals like to attack small companies because those businesses often do not have the expertise or resources to fend them off.
Avoiding becoming a victim of cybersecurity, does not just mean evading being attacked. Rather, it also means assuming you will be attacked and putting proactive measures in place so that your business can survive a cyberattack.
If you are running anti-malware software already in your business, then you already realize the essential role it plays in detecting and blocking known ransomware, viruses, and other types of malwares. However, that is only one of several measures you need to take to protect your company, employees, and customers against cyberattacks.
Make it harder for cybercriminals to attack your IT systems through the weak points that can be exploited.
Your employees can establish an important line of defense against cybercrime. By educating employees on how attacks are carried out, they can help spot attacks rather than fall victim to them. Phishing, Spear Phishing, and Social Engineering should be at the top of your list to cover with them.
Cybercriminals are constantly devising new ways to attack businesses. Despite your best efforts, your business can still fall prey to a cyber attack. So, assume your business will be attacked and establish a cyberattack response plan. We can help you develop a data backup strategy and test it to make sure that your information can be restored in case your company is attacked.
Cybercriminals are constantly releasing new malware programs or variants of existing ones. As a result, relying solely on anti-malware software to protect your business is risky, as it takes a while for the vendors to update their anti-malware software to defend against the new programs and new strains.
We can conduct an in-depth security assessment of your business. Our security experts can recommend other measures you can take to protect your business from cyber criminals. We can also help train your employees."

In early 2017, Comcast sought to track the performance of their digital marketing campaigns. The strategy behind their digital-first approach was to track and monitor targeted populations to mitigate subscriber service downgrades and cancellations due to expiring promotions for Cable TV, Internet, and Telephone packages.
The Challenge
As cable television and traditional phone cord cutting continues to rise. Comcast wants to leverage different marketing offers to push subscribers into more cost-effective promotional packages for Cable TV, Internet, and Telephone service. There is an understanding that there will be a certain percentage of the subscriber base that will always cancel service once the promotion expires however, with careful and intentional marketing messaging, the number of cancellations and downgrades can be minimized.
The Solution
Over a period of 9 months, many data points were used to track subscriber behavior on expiring promotions. Careful consideration was given to demographics, service package, promotion length, and price point thresholds. All of this was achieved through a detailed process of complex SQL, R, and BASH scripting from multiple data sources, data mapping, and ETL processing. Machine learning algorithms were also utilized to train data sets, predict user behaviors, and simulate expected outcomes from marketing input variables.
The Results Contact
By the end of 2017, the number of cancellations and downgrades of customers rolling off promotions month-over-month decreased from 21% down to a sustainable 13%. There was also a significant increase in the percentage of customers repackaging into cost effective promotions from 6% up to 12%. In essence, package cancellations decreased by a third, while retention through repackaging doubled as a direct result of the increased marketing communication and accurate tracking of user behavior over a period of time compared to baseline.

Your employees can establish an important line of defense against cybercrime. By educating employees on how attacks are carried out, they can help spot attacks rather than fall victim to them. Phishing, Spear Phishing, and Social Engineering should be at the top of your list to cover with them.
Cybercriminals are constantly devising new ways to attack businesses. Despite your best efforts, your business can still fall prey to a cyber attack. So, assume your business will be attacked and establish a cyberattack response plan. We can help you develop a data backup strategy and test it to make sure that your information can be restored in case your company is attacked.
Cybercriminals are constantly releasing new malware programs or variants of existing ones. As a result, relying solely on anti-malware software to protect your business is risky, as it takes a while for the vendors to update their anti-malware software to defend against the new programs and new strains.
We can conduct an in-depth security assessment of your business. Our security experts can recommend other measures you can take to protect your business from cyber criminals. We can also help train your employees."

43,https://www.wc3.us/how-covid-has-created-the-need-for-contact-less-services-in-healthcare/,"Living in the time of Covid has created unanticipated challenges in healthcare. Contact-less services are a safeguard for patients that have only grown in demand. This demand isn’t going away any time soon.
How Covid has Impacted Patient Experience.
Many industries have shifted to remote work to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). As direct, personal contact is increasingly being avoided, people have shifted their working behaviors to online channels. This shift occurred in the healthcare community as well.
Every dental office, hospital, and doctor's office has implemented contact-less services. This was a result of shelter-at-home orders. Patients still needed healthcare, and the need for virtual services was born.
With contactless service healthcare applications, patients can still receive healthcare without the risks personal visits generate. For many, this is widely appreciated.
Due to the pandemic, contactless services have gained a renewed significance as the preferred service type by an increasing number of customers. Even today as restrictions have been lifted, many people prefer contactless services for convenience and safety reasons. Telemedicine, which is naturally contactless and was widely used before COVID, has increased rapidly because it does not require direct communication between a patient and healthcare provider.
COVID-19 is expected to bring about a new normal in hybrid healthcare. The traditional face-to-face treatment may return, even if some services using contactless technology were employed during the pandemic.
But there is no doubt that as technology advances, innovative contactless healthcare services will become more common.
Will The Need For Contactless Services Go Away?
The short answer is no.
Now that current technology has proven the capability to provide virtual services, the demand is set.
Some people will always prefer contactless appointments, regardless of social distancing guidelines. The covid pandemic has opened the doors to more flexibility for patients and healthcare providers. Telemedicine visits mean scheduling and time constraint issues have new options for a solution. This leads to better patient experiences.
The focus of quality patient care delivery lies with consistency. Patients should be able to receive the same level of quality care via a camera, that they would in person. An important key to success with this is the use of platforms to make the check-in process of contactless services easier.
How to Streamline Check-in Processes
Navigating a different check-in process is just one challenge contactless services face in the beginning.
Technology errors can cause more frustration for the patient, who is already learning the new process of contactless care. The last things they need are complicated forms and logistical complications from new programs.
Using an automation assistant like PracticeSquire, a product sold and serviced by WC3, enables Contact-Less Self Check-in services which can streamline the registration, eligibility, and payment process for patients. Thus, adding more benefit to contactless services by making them more convenient than ever.
Not only just from a patient perspective, but platform assistants can also help healthcare providers. Software that can help facilitate the registration process adds to the sustainability factor. Doctor’s offices can go green by offering paperless solutions to the registration process. Which decreases the carbon footprint as well as offers a technological route for more social distancing.
Real-time insurance verification can decrease issues found on the eligibility level, even further enhancing patient care and experience. Nurses and medical assistants can then focus on providing healthcare, rather than focusing on the paperwork side of things.

Background
In early 2017, Company X sought to track the performance of their digital marketing campaigns. The strategy behind their digital-first approach was to track and monitor targeted populations to mitigate subscriber service downgrades and cancellations due to expiring promotions for Cable TV, Internet, and Telephone packages.
The Challenge
As cable television and traditional phone cord cutting continues to rise. Company X wants to leverage different marketing offers to push subscribers into more cost-effective promotional packages for Cable TV, Internet, and Telephone service. There is an understanding that there will be a certain percentage of the subscriber base that will always cancel service once the promotion expires however, with careful and intentional marketing messaging, the number of cancellations and downgrades can be minimized.
The Solution
Over a period of 9 months, many data points were used to track subscriber behavior on expiring promotions. Careful consideration was given to demographics, service package, promotion length, and price point thresholds. All of this was achieved through a detailed process of complex SQL, R, and BASH scripting from multiple data sources, data mapping, and ETL processing. Machine learning algorithms were also utilized to train data sets, predict user behaviors, and simulate expected outcomes from marketing input variables.
The Results Contact
By the end of 2017, the number of cancellations and downgrades of customers rolling off promotions month-over-month decreased from 21% down to a sustainable 13%. There was also a significant increase in the percentage of customers repackaging into cost effective promotions from 6% up to 12%. In essence, package cancellations decreased by a third, while retention through repackaging doubled as a direct result of the increased marketing communication and accurate tracking of user behavior over a period of time compared to baseline.

63,https://www.wc3.us/services/cloud-computing/,"Remote Data Storing, Managing, and Processing
Cloud computing has become popular in the business world and for good reason.
Thanks to cloud computing, you can:
Add technology resources to your business without large capital investments.
Effortlessly scale your operations as your business grows.
Eliminate the need to maintain and manage some areas of your IT environment.
Give employees easy access to the data and applications they need to do their jobs.
To take advantage of cloud computing, you need to know your options
What you can put in the cloud? The types of clouds that you can use and What kind of security you will need?
What You Can Put in the Cloud?
Today, most components of an IT environment can be provided as a cloud service. You can put software, hardware, and essential operations in the cloud.
Software in the Cloud
Using cloud-based software is one of the most common ways businesses take advantage of cloud computing. There is a wide variety of hosted applications available from providers, ranging from office productivity suites to customer relationship management software. You also have the option of putting software you already own in a cloud. For example, you might have proprietary software that you want to deliver to employees in different offices. WC3 has the team that can help you evaluate which applications would be better off in the cloud to increase your productivity.
Hardware in the Cloud
If your servers, storage devices, and networking equipment are inadequate because your business is growing, you might benefit from putting your IT infrastructure in the cloud. It is not an all-or-nothing proposition, though. You can put individual components in the cloud. For instance, instead of buying a file server, you can use a cloud storage service that lets employees store and share their files.
Essential Operations in the Cloud
Crucial IT operations can be put in the cloud. Rather than dealing with the hassle of backing up all your data, you could have a provider perform your data backups and then store a copy of the backup files at its facility. Deciding what to put in the cloud is not an easy task because of all the possibilities.
Let WC3 walk you through your options and help you determine the best way you can take advantage of cloud computing.
The Types of Clouds You Can Use
Public Clouds
Microsoft Azure, Dropbox, and Google Drive are examples of public clouds. A public cloud provider uses the same hardware (e.g., servers, storage devices, networking equipment) to deliver its cloud services to all its customers. So, for instance, if you subscribe to Google Drive, your files are on the same hardware as the other subscribers’ files.
There are benefits to using a public cloud. For starters, you can add IT resources without having to make large capital investments. Another advantage is that you can quickly change the number of resources you are using, letting you efficiently operate your business. Finally, you do not need to manage the IT resource you are getting through the provider.
Private Clouds
A private cloud is used exclusively by a single company that has multiple business units. Those business units use the services being provided by the private cloud, much like multiple companies use the services being delivered by a public cloud. You can choose to own a private cloud or lease one from a provider.
The main advantage of using a private cloud is tighter security, which is important if you must comply with government regulations. Because you do not share the hardware with other organizations, you do not have to worry about your resources being vulnerable if another company’s resources become infected with malware or get hacked. In addition, you control internal and external access to your private cloud.
Hybrid Clouds
Some people mistakenly believe that having a hybrid cloud means that you keep all your IT operations in-house, except for connecting one server to a public cloud. A hybrid cloud refers to an IT environment that uses both private and public clouds. The clouds operate independently, but they communicate with each other. Sometimes, technologies are used to achieve data and application portability between them.
The main benefit of using a hybrid cloud is that it is highly customizable. For example, you can use a private cloud for the IT resources that need tighter security, while using a public cloud for those resources you want to be scalable.
The Cloud Security You Need
Security is one of the most overlooked parts of cloud computing. Using consumer-grade options might be adequate for personal use, but your business requires tighter security and more control over its file access. For example, your clients may be subject to government regulations, which could require you to maintain specific levels of encryption and security with all their data you manage. You may require restriction of access of your company’s financial data from your senior management. You may also need to keep a log of who accessed each file and when or maintain an archive of emails from deleted accounts of past employees. All of this is possible.
Our team at WC3 will decipher the numerous options available to you and make appropriate recommendations that align with your business goals and security needs.
Finding the Right Solution for Your Business
None of the three cloud types are inherently better than the other, as each cloud type meets different needs. Our Cloud Specialist can help you decipher the numerous options available to you and make appropriate recommendations that align with your business goals and security needs.
No matter whether you need to put one application or your entire IT infrastructure in the cloud, our team will help you implement that solution and ensure it seamlessly integrates into your IT environment."
64,https://www.wc3.us/services/cyber-security/,"These headlines are clear, ransomware, phishing, and other types of cyberattacks are increasing in number and sophistication. No business is too small, and the fact is that cybercriminals like to attack small companies because those businesses often do not have the expertise or resources to fend them off.
Avoiding becoming a victim of cybersecurity, does not just mean evading being attacked. Rather, it also means assuming you will be attacked and putting proactive measures in place so that your business can survive a cyberattack.
If you are running anti-malware software already in your business, then you already realize the essential role it plays in detecting and blocking known ransomware, viruses, and other types of malwares. However, that is only one of several measures you need to take to protect your company, employees, and customers against cyberattacks."
